上攻行情如期来临3180为年底第一目标华讯财经11月迎来开门红。呈现放量上攻、个股普涨格局。受美元大幅走低的影响，两市高开后快速上攻至3000点关口，并成功收复10日和5日均线。盘面上看，创业板并没有受首批12亿限售股解禁影响，反而是大幅上涨，这无疑带动了市场人气。永磁、黄金、多晶硅、低碳等概念纷纷大涨，而有色、煤炭板块的强势拉升更是让场外资金大幅进场。与此同时，西藏、内蒙、青海等区域板块也有远强于大盘的表现。受调控政策进一步趋紧的影响，地产再次处于跌幅板前列，而化纤、旅游、电力、水泥、传媒等板块表现亦逊色一些。尾盘，股指在3050关口前整固并成功攻破。至收盘时，两市9成个股上扬，沪指收在3054.05点，大涨2.52%，两市66只个股涨停，无非ST个股跌停，成交量2539亿，比上一交易日大幅增加。消息面上看，今日公布的PMI数据符合市场预期，环比上月再度明显提升。这表明国内制造业在节能减排、地产投资减速、外围经济复苏糟糕等等不利情况下依旧有良好表现，当然维护了市场信心。煤炭板块在原油价格盘整阶段依旧能得以充当领头羊，还在于未来资源价格上涨预期强烈，当然，电力企业的亏损却不能反过来让煤企让利，也是板块得以持续暴涨的重要原因。另外，就钢铁板块而言，虽有强势涨停的包钢、广钢吸引眼球，但还是不能带动该板块三个龙头品种强势反弹，根本原因在于行业进入需求淡季，业绩提升没有太大想象空间。至于印度呼吁禁止该国铁矿石出口，虽一定程度上推动国内进口印度矿石上涨压力，但全球铁矿石市场暂时依旧低迷。行业的最大困境还在于下游需求的疲软。华讯投资认为，短期多头已经占据盘面主动，后期还有惯性上攻动力。股指在2950点附近止跌企稳并再一次站稳5日线，宣告持续多日的回调结束，后期大盘将进一步巩固箱体上沿，并为下一轮反攻蓄势。图形上看，3160-3180区间依旧是上方的最强压力位，而年线位置2890-2900一带有强支撑。日MACD指标来看，放量上攻避免了高位死叉的结局，而周MACD指标来看，DIF已经上穿至0轴以上，且红烛继续变长。影响本周股指运行的消息面在于外围。本周美联储、欧洲央行等发达国家的最新利率政策备受市场关注，另外美联储关于量化宽松政策的具体金额及实施方案也决定了未来一段时间全球流动性的总量。人民币升值和大宗商品价格持续走高的态势近期不会改变，而升幅则影响股指反攻高度。操作上，投资者可积极关注沿5日线上行的强势品种，并适当参与。关注人民币升值受益板块，抗通胀品种，军工为首的重组个股，依旧有强烈补涨要求的二线蓝筹品种。更多资讯和数据点击进入股票频道		正向	The upward trend is on schedule, with 3180 as the first goal for the end of the year. Huaxun Financial will welcome a red start in November. Presenting a pattern of increased volume and overall gains in individual stocks. Affected by the sharp decline of the US dollar, the two markets opened high and quickly advanced to the 3000-point level, successfully recovering the 10-day and 5-day moving averages. From the chart, the Growth Enterprise Market was not affected by the first batch of 1.2 billion shares being unlocked, but instead, it rose sharply, which undoubtedly boosted market sentiment. Permanent magnet, gold, multicrystalline silicon, low carbon and other concepts surged, and the strong pull of non-ferrous metals and coal sectors has also attracted a large amount of funds from outside the market. Meanwhile, the Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and other regional plates also showed much stronger performance than the market. Affected by the further tightening of regulated policies, real estate is again at the forefront of the decline, while the performance of sectors such as chemical fiber, tourism, power, cement, and media is also somewhat worse. At the end of the day, the stock index consolidated around the 3050 level and successfully broke through. At the close, 90% of the stocks on the two markets rose, and the Shanghai Composite Index closed at 3054.05 points, up 2.52%. There were 66 stocks with a limit up, and no non-ST stocks with a limit down. The volume was 253.9 billion, which was significantly higher than the previous trading day. The PMI data released today met market expectations and showed a significant increase compared to last month. This indicates that domestic manufacturing has performed well despite the adverse conditions of energy conservation and emission reduction, slowing real estate investment, and poor recovery of the external economy, and of course, it has maintained market confidence. The coal sector can still play the leading role during the consolidation phase of crude oil prices, and this is also due to the strong expectation of rising resource prices in the future. Of course, the losses of power enterprises cannot reverse the coal enterprises' willingness to reduce prices, which is also an important reason for the continued explosive growth of the sector. As for the steel sector, although Baogang and Guanggang, which have strong daily limit-up, attract attention, they still cannot lead the three leading varieties in the sector to a strong rebound. The fundamental reason is that the industry has entered the season of weak demand, and the space for performance improvement is not very large. As for India’s appeal to ban the export of iron ore from the country, it has to some extent increased the pressure on the import of Indian ore in the domestic market, but the global iron ore market remains sluggish for the time being. The greatest difficulty in the industry lies in the weak demand at the downstream. Huaxun Investment believes that the short-term bulls have taken the initiative in the market and there is still momentum for further upward attack in the later period. The index stopped falling and stabilized around 2950 points, and once again stood above the 5-day line, announcing the end of the continuous adjustment that lasted for several days. In the later period, the major market will further consolidate the upper limit of the box and prepare for the next counterattack. Graphically, the 3160-3180 range remains the strongest resistance level above, while the 2890-2900 area around the annual line provides strong support. From the daily MACD, the volume surge and the advance avoided the top dead cross, while from the weekly MACD, DIF has already crossed above the 0 axis and the red candle continues to grow longer. The factors affecting the operation of the stock index this week are from the outside. This week, the latest interest rate policies of the Fed, the ECB, and other developed countries have attracted the attention of the market, and the specific amount and implementation plan of the Fed's quantitative easing policy also determine the total amount of global liquidity in the future. The recent trend of the RMB appreciation and the continuous rise in the price of primary commodities will not change, and the extent of the appreciation will affect the height of the rebound of the stock index. In terms of operations, investors can actively pay attention to strong varieties that are rising along the 5-day line and participate appropriately. Focus on the sectors benefiting from the appreciation of the RMB, anti-inflation varieties, and the restructured individual stocks led by the military industry, as well as the second-tier blue-chip varieties with a strong demand for strong rebound.

哈马斯誓言将发动第三次起义击溃以色列政权中国网12月28日讯据以色列媒体28日报道，以色列军方27日对加沙地带发动大规模空袭，目前已造成数百人死伤，哈马斯的办公机构和多座营地也遭到严重损毁。哈马斯武装27日晚发表声明，誓言将发动“第三次起义”彻底击溃以色列政权。哈马斯武装在27日晚发布的声明中说，以色列针对巴勒斯坦的平民目标发动类似于恐怖袭击的军事行动，目前已经造成了数百名无辜平民死伤，哈马斯将对以色列实施“地狱式”报复，继续向以色列境内发射火箭弹。这份声明还威胁说，战争已经打响，哈马斯发动“第三次起义”的时机已经来临，哈马斯武装发誓将给予“复国主义者敌人以最致命的打击”，彻底击溃以色列政权，但这次起义“对于巴勒斯坦人民来说却会是和平的”。哈马斯还在声明中呼吁全体巴勒斯坦人民团结起来，勇敢地针对以色列目标以及以色列士兵发动自杀式袭击，以让以色列政权“清楚地感受到我们的反抗决心”。哈马斯武装组织发言人巴尔胡姆27日也要求其下属武装派别对以色列发射远程火箭弹，以报复以军空袭加沙。巴尔胡姆说，以军对加沙的空袭是对全体巴勒斯坦人的犯罪，该组织已要求其下属武装派别卡桑旅对以发射射程更远的火箭弹。此外，加沙地带的其他许多巴武装派别认为，以军当天的袭击是“公然的宣战”，并表示准备对以实施一系列的突袭。就在以军空袭加沙2小时后，加沙的哈马斯武装对以南部内盖夫地区发射30多枚火箭弹和多枚迫击炮弹。其中一枚火箭弹击中内提沃特城镇1民房，造成1名居民死亡，另有3人受伤。卡桑旅目前已经宣布对此次火箭弹袭击事件负责。针对这次空袭行动，以色列军方当天发表声明说，以色列空袭加沙是为报复哈马斯连日来向以境内发射火箭弹，以军打击目标是哈马斯机构。以军将继续对哈马斯采取行动，直至加沙地带武装人员停止针对以色列的袭击行动。以总统佩雷斯在接受媒体采访时表示，以方将采取一切必要措施制止哈马斯等武装组织针对以色列的袭击行动，但以方并不计划再次占领加沙地带。巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯的发言人阿布-鲁代纳当天在约旦河西岸城市拉姆安拉发表声明说，“阿巴斯强烈谴责以色列方面向加沙地带发动的侵略行为，他呼吁以色列政府立即停止对加沙地带的侵略，并呼吁国际社会进行干预。”以色列和以哈马斯为主的加沙各武装派别今年6月达成一项停火协议。停火协议12月19日到期后，哈马斯向以色列境内发射大约百枚火箭弹和迫击炮弹，没有造成以色列人伤亡。以色列先前曾威胁还击，但以色列媒体26日报道说，以军的行动将会有所限制，不会发动大规模袭击。(萧熙)	哈马斯,巴尔胡姆,卡桑,佩雷斯,阿巴斯,阿布-鲁代纳,萧熙	正向	"Hamas vows to launch a third intifada to crush the Israeli regime. China media, December 28, 2022. According to the Israeli media on the 28th, the Israeli military launched a large-scale air strike on the Gaza Strip on the 27th, resulting in hundreds of casualties, and Hamas' office buildings and multiple camps were also severely damaged. Hamas armed forces issued a statement on the night of the 27th, vowing to launch a ""third uprising"" to thoroughly defeat the Israeli regime. In a statement released by Hamas armed forces on the evening of the 27th, it said that Israel launched a military operation similar to a terrorist attack against the civilian targets of Palestine, which has already caused hundreds of innocent civilians to be injured and killed, and Hamas will retaliate against Israel with ""hellish"" revenge and continue to launch rockets into Israeli territory. The statement also threatened that war had begun, and the time for Hamas to launch a ""third intifada"" had arrived, with Hamas' armed forces vowing to deliver the ""most lethal blow to the enemy of the returnees"" and to completely defeat the Israeli regime, but this uprising would be ""peaceful"" for the Palestinian people. Hamas also called on all Palestinians to unite and launch suicide attacks against Israeli targets and soldiers to make the Israeli regime “clearly feel our resistance determination.” On the 27th, Hamas armed organization spokesman Barhoom also called on its subordinate armed factions to launch long-range rocket attacks on Israel in retaliation for the Israeli army's air strike on Gaza. Barhumi said that the Israeli air strike on Gaza was a crime against all Palestinians, and the organization has asked its subordinate armed factions, the Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, to launch longer-range rockets. In addition, many other Palestinian armed factions in Gaza believed that the IDF's attack on that day was a ""public declaration of war"" and that they were ready to launch a series of attacks on Israel. Within two hours of the Israeli air strike on Gaza, Hamas militants in Gaza fired more than 30 rockets and mortar shells at the southern Negev region of Israel. One rocket hit a civilian house in the town of Nittawat, killing one resident and injuring three others. Casun旅已宣布对此次火箭弹袭击事件负责。 In response to this air strike operation, the Israeli military issued a statement on the same day, saying that Israel's air strike on Gaza was to retaliate for Hamas' continuous rocket attacks on Israeli territory, and the Israeli military's attack targets were Hamas institutions. The Israeli army will continue to take action against Hamas until the armed personnel in Gaza stop attacking Israel. President Peres, in an interview with the media, said that Israel would take all necessary measures to stop Hamas and other armed organizations from attacking Israel, but Israel does not plan to occupy the Gaza Strip again. Abu Ruaidah, Abbas' spokesman, issued a statement in Ramallah, a city in the West Bank, Jordan, on the same day, saying, ""Abbas strongly condemns the Israeli attack on Gaza, and calls on the Israeli government to immediately stop the attack on Gaza and calls on the international community to intervene."" A ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and various armed factions in Gaza, led by Hamas, in June this year. After the cease-fire agreement expired on December 19, Hamas fired about a hundred rockets and mortars into Israeli territory, without causing any Israeli casualties. Israel had previously threatened to retaliate, but the Israeli media reported on the 26th that the IDF's actions would be limited and would not launch a large-scale attack. (Xiao Xi)"

经济学家预测：2011大宗商品价格上涨趋势明显中广网北京2月19日消息(记者周晋竹)据经济之声报道，在今天(19日)召开的2011中国宏观经济预测春季年会上，多位经济学家预测，今年大宗商品价格存在上涨趋势，农产品和能源类的价格上行压力尤为明显。由于大宗商品在产业层面的基础性作用，以及在资本市场上可以用作规避价格风险的金融工具，使得大宗商品的价格走向备受关注。澳大利亚力拓公司CEO艾博年认为，铁矿石现货价已接近200美元/吨的历史高位，这是一年前无法预计的，即便如此，由于近两年几乎没有大型新矿山投产，供需矛盾仍然紧张。中国社科院数量经济与技术经济研究所所长汪同三做出了大宗商品在今年看涨的预测。汪同三：大宗商品价格肯定是看涨，不是由我们决定，它是由国际市场决定。现在世界经济总体来说处于缓慢复苏恢复过程中，必然加大对大宗商品需求，造成大宗商品价格上涨。还有一个因素就是美国搞QE2，QE2的政策目标指向是提高价格，以美元计价的国际商品大宗价格的上涨。国际市场上大宗商品价格上涨必然导致我们国内这些价格同时上涨。申银万国证券研究所首席宏观分析师李慧勇则更为详细地指出，今年农产品和原油的价格上行趋势明显：李慧勇：2011年大宗商品结构优明显分化，我个人看好农产品和原油。中国农业银行金融市场研究负责人李刚也对农产品未来上涨幅度表示担忧，此外他还从两个方面解读了大宗商品上涨的原因：李刚：大宗商品我认为是非常特殊的商品，供给弹性少于需求弹性，供给短期内不会增长，但是需求很大。第二它很大程度上取决于它是以美元计价，2011年上半年虽然美国经济在复苏，但是整个美元是小幅走弱的态势，有一个轻微的刺激作用。不过，李刚也指出，影响大宗商品价格波动的原因中，不全都是上行的压力，也还存在消弱的因素，比如中国的政策紧缩：李刚：去年末出台的政策紧缩，当时是期货市场跌幅最大。目前情况来看，今年无论是加息还是提高准备金率，对世界的商品价格影响是消减。	周晋竹,艾博年,汪同三,李慧勇,李刚	正向	Economists predict: the trend of commodity prices rising in 2011 is obvious. China Radio International, Beijing, February 19 (Reporter Zhou Jinju) According to the economic voice report, at the 2011 China Macroeconomic Forecast Spring Conference held today (19), many economists predict that commodity prices will have an upward trend this year, and the upward pressure on agricultural products and energy prices is particularly obvious. Due to the fundamental role of commodities at the industrial level and their use as financial instruments to hedge price risks in the capital market, the price trends of commodities have attracted much attention. Rio Tinto CEO Ajborn believes that the spot price of iron ore has approached the historical high of $200 per ton, which was unforeseeable a year ago, but due to the fact that no large new mines have been put into production in the past two years, the supply and demand contradiction is still tight. Wang Tongshu, the director of the Institute of Quantitative Economics and Technical Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, made a forecast that the commodities would be on the rise this year. Wang Tongshan: The prices of primary commodities are definitely on the rise, not decided by us, but by the international market. Now the world economy is in a slow recovery process, which will inevitably increase the demand for primary commodities and cause the prices of primary commodities to rise. Another factor is that the US is implementing QE2, whose policy target is to raise prices, leading to an increase in the international commodity prices denominated in US dollars. Commodity prices on the international market will inevitably lead to a rise in these prices in our country. Li Huiyong, the chief macro analyst of Shenwan Hongyuan Securities Research Institute, pointed out in more detail that the upward trend of agricultural products and crude oil prices was obvious this year: Li Huiyong: The structure of commodities in 2011 is clearly divided, and I personally have a good outlook on agricultural products and crude oil. Li Gang, the head of the Agricultural Bank of China’s financial market research, also expressed concern about the future rise in agricultural product prices. In addition, he explained the reasons for the rise in commodity prices from two aspects: Li Gang: I think commodities are very special goods. The supply elasticity is less than the demand elasticity, and the supply will not increase in the short term, but the demand is very large. Second, it largely depends on the fact that it is priced in US dollars. Although the US economy was recovering in the first half of 2011, the US dollar was generally weak, which had a slight stimulating effect. However, Li Gang also pointed out that not all the factors affecting the fluctuations in the prices of primary commodities were upward pressures, and there were also weakening factors, such as China's policy tightening: Li Gang: The policy tightening at the end of last year was the biggest drop in the futures market at that time. Given the current situation, it is likely that either an interest rate hike or a reserve requirement ratio increase this year will reduce the world’s commodity prices.

武汉富士康上演抢人大战今年员工规模超5万中新社武汉1月27日电(记者徐金波)兔年春节临近，湖北武汉27日迎来外出务工人员返程高潮，部分业务内迁至武汉园区的富士康趁机发起“抢人大战”，以较为可观的薪酬欲在年后招收3万多名普通工人，从而满足生产用工需求。当天，从中国各地返程的湖北外出务工人员，不断地从武汉、武昌和汉口三大火车站奔涌而出，随即转向附近的宏基、傅家坡、新荣村等公路客运站。在这些大型交通枢纽出入口，武汉富士康的招聘广告吸引了众多返乡的外出务工人员前来咨询、填表。据了解，富士康武汉园区新增岗位主要以基层作业员(普工)为主，只要年满16周岁、具有初中及同等学历，均可报名应聘。新进员工试用期及考核期月收入可达2200元，考核期满后最高可达2800元。其中，数控、电子、机械类中职中专生最受欢迎。富士康科技集团副总裁简宜彬说，2007年4月投资10亿美元的武汉工业园一期工程现已建成投产，园区工人超过2万。随着富士康加快内迁步伐和园区配套设施逐步完善，富士康近期会陆续把原设在深圳和烟台的台式电脑生产线迁来武汉，3到5年内富士康武汉园区的台式电脑年产量将达到6800多万台，约占全球台式电脑年产量的一半。此外，还有一些游戏机生产线也将转移到武汉。今年4月到6月间，有3批新的生产线在富士康武汉产业园投产，急需招收3万多名普通工人。届时，园区的员工规模将超过5万人。(完)	徐金波,简宜彬	正向	"Shenzhen Foxconn Launches Talent War in Wuhan This Year, with More Than 50,000 Employees. Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 27 (Reporter Xu Jinfu) As the Spring Festival of the Year of the Rabbit is approaching, a peak of migrant workers returning to Wuhan, Hubei Province, was observed on January 27. Foxconn, which has relocated some of its business to the Wuhan park, launched a ""talent war"" to recruit more than 30,000 ordinary workers with relatively generous salaries after the Spring Festival to meet the demand for production labor. On that day, Hubei migrant workers returning to their hometowns from all over China poured out of the Wuhan, Wuchang and Hankou railway stations, and then turned to nearby highway passenger stations such as Hongji, Fuganjiao and Xinrongcun. At the entrances of these large transportation hubs, recruitment advertisements for Wuhan Foxconn attracted a large number of migrant workers returning home to inquire and fill out forms. It is understood that the new positions added to the Foxconn Wuhan park are mainly grassroots production workers (general workers), and anyone who is at least 16 years old and has a junior high school education or equivalent can apply. New employees can earn a monthly income of 2200 yuan during the probationary and assessment period, and the maximum after the assessment period is 2800 yuan. Among them, students of CNC, electronics, and mechanical vocational high schools are the most popular. Chen Yibin, vice president of Foxconn Technology Group, said that the first phase of the Wuhan Industrial Park, which invested 1 billion US dollars in April 2007, has now been completed and put into production, with more than 20,000 workers in the park. With Foxconn accelerating its internal relocation and the gradual improvement of the park's supporting facilities, Foxconn will gradually move its desktop computer production lines from Shenzhen and Yantai to Wuhan in the near future. In 3 to 5 years, the annual production of desktop computers in the Foxconn Wuhan Park will reach more than 68 million units, accounting for about half of the global annual production of desktop computers. In addition, some game console production lines will also be transferred to Wuhan. In April to June this year, three new production lines were put into operation in the Foxconn Wuhan Industrial Park, and more than 30,000 ordinary workers were urgently needed. At that time, the number of employees in the park will exceed 50,000. (End)"
联手NVIDIA微软明年推ZunePhone手机微软的胃口可真大，不但要涉足掌机领域，现在又对手机感兴趣了，而且这次还找了个重量级的合作伙伴—NVIDIA。将NVIDIA的超强显卡技术，通过微软的WM平台整合，这样的手机确实令人期待啊。微软是为老手，做事讲究步步为营，不会去打没有把握的仗，这就容易显得拖沓，今年年初曾传闻微软将会插手游戏手机的研发，这样可以理解，X360的表现与PSP有的一拼。随后又有消息，微软很有可能将会在未来不久推出一款ZunePhone。直到近日最新消息，微软一款与NVIDIA合作的产品会在明年2月的3GSM大会上发布，更进一步证实了此前的种种传闻。不过想如苹果一样赚得的盆满钵圆，现在看来所有厂商都有有难度，微软也是如此，不过现在既然联合了NVIDIA公司，手机产品的显示硬件必然有个飞跃，加入更多娱乐操作的环节必然能令这款产品高人一筹。明年的WindowsMobile6.5、7平台会不会用在这款手机上也是人们值得讨论的话题之一。		正向	Team up with NVIDIA, Microsoft will launch ZunePhone phone next year. Microsoft's appetite is really big, not only to venture into the handheld game field, but also interested in mobile phones, and this time it has a heavyweight partner - NVIDIA. Integrating NVIDIA's powerful graphics card technology with Microsoft's WM platform, such a mobile phone is indeed worth looking forward to. Microsoft is for the old hands, and it is careful about every step, and will not take risks, which is easy to be sluggish. At the beginning of this year, it was rumored that Microsoft would intervene in the research and development of game phones, which can be understood, X360's performance is comparable to PSP. Then there was news that Microsoft was likely to release a ZunePhone in the near future. Until the latest news, Microsoft's product in cooperation with NVIDIA will be released at the 3GSM conference in February next year, further confirming the previous rumors. But to make a fortune like Apple, it seems that all manufacturers, including Microsoft, have a hard time. However, now that they have joined forces with NVIDIA, the display hardware of mobile products will certainly take a leap, and adding more entertainment operations will certainly make this product stand out. Whether Windows Mobile 6.5, 7 platform will be used on this mobile phone next year is also one of the topics worth discussing.
裸露巨胸靠胸吃饭4个女人(组图)导语：把明星分为实力派、偶像派显然不够科学，因为还有一派是“爆乳派”。全球范围内选取靠胸吃饭女明星供大家欣赏。其中有货真价实三版女郎，也有一时充数的国际巨星，具体是否属于爆乳派请各位自己分析。“假波”林志玲台湾第一名模林志玲为了证明自己胸部的“真材实料”，几乎无所不用其极，出医院报告、抬手现腋下，最近更是让女记者亲手“验胸”，为的就是要打破“假波”传闻，还自己“咪咪”一个公道。其实，林志玲种种举措并不单单是因为她个人名誉的原因，相信更大的理由是为了自己的饭碗。要知道伊人是靠一个丰胸纤体广告走红的，如果连身材都是假的，那么以后还怎么靠“胸”吃饭呢？而在台湾娱乐圈，这种靠“胸”吃饭的女星实在多不胜数。	林志玲	正向	"Naked big breasts eating with breasts, four women (photo group) introduction: It is not scientific to classify stars as power stars or idol stars, because there is also a ""big bust"" group.

辽宁队长点评救火外援他不强大却给外线球员底气边强：大号的亚历山大更强大曾和亚历山大做过队友的边强对这位“老朋友”的回归感到兴奋，这不仅是因为亚历山大和他有不错的私交，更是因为现在的亚历山大展现出了比以前更强大的实力。身为队长的边强代表辽宁队队员喊出了自信：“以前球队遭遇了一段困难的时期，但随着双外援的就位，我们还是有信心冲进季后赛的。”身体明显大了一号时隔几年后再次见到老朋友亚历山大，辽宁队队长边强显得很开心：“我记得他在CBA2003-04赛季效力过辽宁队，当时我在队中还是小队员，那时候主教练郭指导和教练接军都还在打球呢，但是当时我和亚历山大的关系就很不错，经常开玩笑。现在他回来，我们都很高兴。”亚历山大给边强的第一感觉就是，他的身体比以前强壮了很多。“我记得当时他比较瘦，身体比较单薄，所以在内线的对抗中比较吃亏。这次他回到辽宁队中，当天训练的时候脱了外套一看，明显比以前大了一号，我想他的力量肯定增强了不少，这点对缺乏内线对抗能力的我们很有帮助。”边强显得有点兴奋。边强的这个预感很快便得到了证实。在随后辽宁队与天津队的比赛中，亚历山大在内线的表现得到了全队的认可。在谈到亚历山大的防守时，边强说：“这场比赛他打得不错，在防守对方外援和保护后场篮板球方面给了我们很大的帮助，他在内线对抗上也进步了不少，水平比之前高多了。”罚篮是大多数中锋的软肋，之前的亚历山大也不例外。而让边强欣喜的是，亚历山大现在的罚篮水平也有了明显的提高，“现在他罚篮比以前准多了，你们是没见过他以前的罚篮，那真是和奥尼尔差不多，但通过这两天的训练，我感觉他比以前强了不少。”外线球员更有底气辽宁队上下对亚历山大在防守端的表现都非常认可，但防守只是亚历山大带给球队帮助的一个方面，作为一名内线中锋球员，他在对阵天津队的比赛中更是送出了5次助攻和2次抢断。对于这方面的表现，边强认为：“他的策应能力很好，现在我们突破进去他能很好地找到接球位置去投篮得分，当背身单打遇到包夹的时候，他也能看到外线的空当给我们创造投篮机会。”尽管谨慎的郭士强认为亚历山大的实力还有待于比赛的进一步检验，但身为球员的边强却切身地体会到了亚历山大带来的变化，“最明显的是，他现在在内线一站，我们外线球员出手时就更果断，因为有篮板球的保证，所以我们更自信了。”在边强看来，现在的亚历山大状态并没有调整到最佳，他完全可以打得更好。“我相信他会打得更好，因为他现在还在倒时差，接下来的比赛，他一定会带给我们更多的惊喜。”边强说道。	边强,亚历山大,郭指导,接军,奥尼尔,郭士强	正向	"The captain of Liaoning commented on the fire-fighting foreign aid, who is not strong but gives the players on the outside confidence. Bianqiang, who once played with Alexander, is excited about the return of this ""old friend"", not only because Alexander and he have a good private relationship, but also because Alexander now shows a stronger strength than before. As the team captain, Bian Qiang, on behalf of the team members of Liaoning, shouted out their confidence: ""The team once went through a difficult period, but with the arrival of two foreign players, we still have confidence to enter the playoffs."" The body is obviously a size larger. After several years, when I met my old friend Alexander again, the captain of the Liaoning team, Bian Qiang, was very happy. ""I remember that he played for the Liaoning team in the CBA 2003-04 season. At that time, I was still a young player in the team. At that time, Coach Guo and Coach Jie Jun were still playing. However, at that time, my relationship with Alexander was very good, and we often joked around. Now that he is back, we are all very happy. Alexander's first impression of Jianqiang was that his body was much stronger than before. I remember that he was thinner and more frail at the time, so he was at a disadvantage in the battle of the boards. This time, when he returned to the Liaoning team, when he took off his coat during the training on that day, it was obviously one size larger than before. I think his strength must have increased a lot, which is very helpful to us who lack the ability to compete in the front court. Jianqiang seemed a little excited. Jianqiang's hunch was soon confirmed. In the subsequent match between Liaoning and Tianjin, Alexander's performance in the paint was recognized by the entire team. When it comes to Alexander's defense, Bianqiang said, ""He played well in this game, and he gave us a lot of help in defending the foreign players and protecting the backcourt rebounds. He has also made great progress in terms of withstanding the inner-line confrontation, and his level is much higher than before."" Free throws are the Achilles' heel of most centers, and the same was true of Alexander before. And what made Bian Qiang so happy was that Alexander's free throw level had also improved significantly recently. ""Now he is much more accurate at free throws than before. You haven't seen his free throws before, they were as bad as Shaq's. But through the training of the past two days, I feel that he is much better than before."" The outside players have more confidence. The players of Liaoning team all think that Alexander's performance in defense is very good. But defense is only one aspect of the help that Alexander brings to the team. As a center player, he even gave 5 assists and 2 steals in the game against Tianjin team. Regarding his performance, Bian Qiang said, ""His passing ability is very good. Now when we break through, he can find a good position to shoot and score. When he is double-teamed in the post, he can also see the open space for us to create shooting opportunities for the outside."" Although Guo Shiqiang, who is always cautious, thinks that Alexander’s strength still needs to be further tested in the game, but as a player, Bian Qiang has a direct feeling of the changes brought by Alexander. ""The most obvious is that now that he stands in the frontcourt, our players on the periphery are more decisive when shooting, because of the guarantee of rebounds, so we are more confident."" In Biaoxiang's view, Alexander's current condition has not been adjusted to the best, and he can play much better. I believe he will play better, because he is still adjusting to the time difference now, and in the next match, he will definitely bring us more surprises. Jianqiang said."
体操神童诉体校虐待案再开庭证人翻供引爆4大矛盾昨天下午，少年体操冠军高帅诉先农坛体校“虐待”案再次在宣武法院开庭，先农坛体校6名相关人员出庭为先农坛体校作证。曾称体操队负责人不让教高帅的教练朱辉说，他当时与体操队负责人有矛盾才这样说，“不是真实情况”。高帅曾多次获得少儿、青少年级别全国体操冠军，2006年被选送先农坛体校。今年4月29日，高帅离校出走，之后住进精神病院。高帅起诉先农坛体校，索要15万余元赔偿(本报11月8日、12月8日先后报道)。高帅昨天没有出庭。他母亲韩冬梅一个人坐在原告席上。她将家里的电视和DVD搬到原告席上，准备播放3盘DVD和6盘VCD作为录像和录音的证据。她说，高帅现在精神抑郁的病情加重，有一些暴躁，担心他看了录像会受刺激。根据韩冬梅与先农坛体校的证据，双方主要就高帅是否在先农坛体校遭受殴打与是否经过正常训练进行了质证。韩冬梅出示了朱辉所说过的“杨月山不让他教高帅”的录音。朱辉承认曾经说过，但表示，这是因为他与杨月山有矛盾才说的，“并不是真实的情况。”此案未当庭宣判。焦点1高帅被体罚？之前的庭审中，韩冬梅说，高帅在先农坛体校经常受到殴打和体罚，殴打他的大队员有60多条打人的方法。昨日，双方就此进行了论辩。【高母】别人训练高帅跪着【杨月山】这是练习压脚面韩冬梅当庭播放了一段录像，高帅进入先农坛体校的第一个教练杨月山在指导一个孩子训练，高帅在旁边跪着看，孩子停止训练后，高帅帮着挪器具。韩冬梅说，让高帅跪着就是非人的虐待，不但不给训练，还让搬东西。对此，杨月山说，高帅跪着是在练习压脚面，其他孩子也有这样的动作，并不是虐待他。先农坛体校的律师说，一次光盘不能说明问题，要求韩冬梅拿出全年的录像。“应该你们拿出全年录像！”韩冬梅冲他大喊。庭后，高帅在电话里说，录像中是杨月山让他跪着的。他说压脚面的动作是膝盖与脚尖着地，上身尽力向后躺，而他当时是纯粹地跪着。【高母】大队员有60多条打人方法【杨月山】只是孩子之间打闹韩冬梅说高帅被欺负多次后，学校召开家长座谈会，当时体操队的负责人杨月山和胡秉臣都参加了。学校还要求打人的孩子每人写检查，孩子写出来的检查中，共有60多条打人方法。座谈会上，杨月山把一张写有几十个打人方法的纸条给了其他家长看，但不给韩冬梅看。杨月山否认纸条存在，他说，孩子之间打闹，就是踢一脚，借1块钱的事情，没有几十条打人方法。随后，胡秉臣出庭作证时说，纸条存在，但现在找不到了。焦点2高帅未训练？高帅起诉书中称，他在先农坛体校从未受过训练，教练不教他一个动作。先农坛体校向法庭出具了3名教练的训练计划，称对高帅进行了正常的训练。【高母】教练计划“空白”4个月【校方律师】这是教练笔误高帅的第一个教练杨月山说，他严格按训练计划对高帅进行了训练。去年7月，他将高帅交给了马长森教练，马长森训练后，由朱辉教练带高帅。韩冬梅否认高帅被马长森教过。她说，先农坛体校提供的教练计划中，去年7月至10月是空白的，马长森教练的教练计划上，落款时间是今年的7月至10月。而这个时候，高帅正在安定医院就诊。“这是马长森教练的事。”杨月山说。先农坛体校律师解释，这是马长森教练的笔误。【高母】朱辉曾说“领导要求不教高帅”【朱辉】这不是真实情况高帅的另一名教练朱辉出庭作证说，他接手训练高帅时，高帅的水平要比进入先农坛体校时有所提高。韩冬梅立即放出录音，朱辉在录音中说，高帅当时的水平赶不上进入先农坛的时候，一些基本动作高帅已经不能再做，还说这是教练的问题，学校的责任。录音中，朱辉还说，杨月山和他说，不要教高帅，要教另外一个孩子。法官要求朱辉解释，他说，这些话他确实说过，但只是他的话，不是真实情况。他说，杨月山当时是他的领导，但他与杨在专项教学与技术理解上有分歧，认为杨月山的教学有问题。他说对杨有个人看法，而且当时他认为在体操队受到一些不合理的待遇，所以才这样说的。本组稿件采写/本报记者王殿学田颖是什么让12岁冠军写下遗书罕见悲剧究竟谁在说谎？体操神童受虐待欲自杀母亲愤怒状告体校索赔50万	高帅,朱辉,韩冬梅,杨月山,胡秉臣,马长森,杨有,王殿学,田颖	负向	"The case of the gymnastics prodigy suing the gymnastics school for abuse was reopened in the Xuanwu Court yesterday afternoon, with six relevant personnel from the Xiannanguan gymnastics school appearing in court to testify on behalf of the Xiannanguan gymnastics school. The testimony of the witness triggered four major contradictions. The gymnastics team leader who used to be in charge said that he said this about Coach Zhu Hui, who is tall and handsome, because he had a conflict with the gymnastics team leader at that time, and that it was not the truth. Gao Shuai has won multiple national gymnastics championships in the child and youth categories, and was selected to join the Xian Nong Tan Gymnastics School in 2006. Gao Shuai left school on April 29 and then stayed in a mental hospital. Gao Shuai sued Xian农Tan Sports School for 150,000 yuan in compensation (reported in our newspaper on November 8 and December 8). Gao Shuai did not appear in court yesterday. His mother, Han Dongmei, sat alone in the plaintiff's seat. She moved the TV and DVD from her home to the plaintiff's seat and prepared to play 3 DVDs and 6 VCDs as evidence of video and audio recordings. She said that Gao Shuai's mental depression had worsened, and he was a little irritable. She was worried that he would be stimulated by watching the video. According to the evidence of Han Dongmei and Xiannongtan Sports School, the parties mainly argued over whether Gao Shuai was beaten at Xiannongtan Sports School and whether he had received normal training. Han Dongmei showed the recording of Zhu Hui saying that ""Yang Yueshan did not allow Gaoshuai to be taught by him"". Zhu Hui admitted that he had said so, but said that it was because he had a conflict with Yang Yueshan, and that ""it was not the truth."" The case was not pronounced in court. Focus 1 Gao Shuai was physically punished? In the previous trial, Han Dongmei said that Gao Shuai was often beaten and physically punished at the Xian农tan Sports School, and that there were over 60 ways in which senior players beat him. Yesterday, they debated on this issue. 【Gao's mother】Someone trained Gao Shuai to kneel. [Yang Yueshan] This is practicing pressing the foot surface. Han Dongmei played a video in court. The first coach of Xian农tan Sports School, Yang Yueshan, was guiding a child to train. Gao Shuai was kneeling beside him to watch. After the child stopped training, Gao Shuai helped move the equipment. Han Dongmei said that making Gao Shuai kneel is inhuman abuse, not only not giving training, but also making him carry things. Yang Yueshan said that Gao Shuai was kneeling to practice pressing the sole of his foot, and other children also had such actions, and it was not abuse. The lawyer from the Xian农an Tan Sports School said that one CD could not prove the case and asked Han Dongmei to provide the video recordings for the whole year. You should provide the video of the whole year! Han Dongmei shouted at him. After the meeting, Gaoshuai said on the phone that in the video, Yang Yueshan made him kneel. He said that the action of pressing the sole of the foot was to have the knees and the toes on the ground, and the upper body lying back as far as possible, while he was simply kneeling. 【Gao's mother】The big team has over 60 ways to beat people.【Yang Yueshan】It was just children playing around. Han Dongmei said that after Gao Shuai was bullied many times, the school held a parent meeting, at which time the gymnastics team leader Yang Yueshan and Hu Bingchen both participated. The school also required the children who hit others to write a letter of repentance, and there were more than 60 ways to hit others in the letters the children wrote. At the meeting, Yang Yueshan showed the other parents a piece of paper with dozens of methods of beating children, but not Han Dongmei. Yang Yueshan denied the existence of the note, saying that children playing around, it was just a kick, borrowing one dollar, and there were no dozens of ways to beat people. Subsequently, Hu Bingchen testified in court that the note existed, but could not be found now. Focus 2 is tall and handsome but not trained? In his complaint, Gao Shuai said that he had never been trained at the Xiannongtan Sports School, and that the coach did not teach him a single move. The training schedule of three coaches from the Xian农an Tan Sports School was submitted to the court, which stated that Gao Shuai had received normal training. 【Coach's Mother】The coach's plan was ""blank"" for four months.【School Lawyer】This was a mistake by Coach Yang Yueshan, the first coach of Gao Shuai, who strictly followed the training plan to train Gao Shuai. Last July, he handed Gao Shuai over to Coach Ma Changsen, who then trained Gao Shuai under Coach Zhu Hui. Han Dongmei denies that Gao Shuai was taught by Ma Changsen. She said that the coach plan of the Xianongtan Sports School was blank from July to October last year, and the coach plan of Coach Changshen Ma was signed from July to October this year. At this time, Gao Shuai was receiving treatment at the An Ding Hospital. It is Coach Ma Changsen's matter. ""Yang Yu Shan said."" The lawyer from the Xian农an Temple Sports School explained that this was a typographical error by Coach Ma Changshen. [Ni Gao's mother] Zhu Hui once said that ""leadership required not to teach Gao Shuai."" [Zhu Hui] This is not the case. Zhu Hui, another coach of Gao Shuai, testified in court that when he took over the training of Gao Shuai, Gao Shuai's level was higher than when he entered the Xian农tan Sports School. Han Dongmei immediately released the recording. In the recording, Zhu Hui said that Gao Shuai’s level at that time was not up to the time when he entered the Shennongtang, and that some basic movements Gao Shuai could no longer do. He also said that it was the coach’s problem and the school’s responsibility. In the recording, Zhu Hui said that Yang Yueshan told him not to teach Gaoshuai, but to teach another child. The judge asked Zhu Hui to explain, who said that he had indeed said these words, but they were just his words, not the truth. He said that Yang Yueshan was his boss at the time, but he had differences with Yang in specialized teaching and technical understanding, and he believed that there was a problem with Yang Yueshan's teaching. He said that he had a personal opinion of Yang, and that at the time, he believed that he had received some unfair treatment in the gymnastics team, so he said so. This group of manuscripts were written by reporters Wang Dianxue and Tian Ying of our newspaper. What made the 12-year-old champion write a suicide note? A rare tragedy, who is lying?

Organized by the Shanghai Webmaster Association, and co-hosted by China Fuwang, Congrong 365, CaiFu Tong, Guocheng Network, Green Alliance Technology, China Nail Network, and News Release Online, the 2009 China Internet Grassroots Conference, which carried a lot of glory and dreams, brought the first Shanghai Small and Medium-sized Website Cultural Festival to a climax and closed in a magnificent way. The theme of the 2009 Grassroots Conference was ""Seeking Up and Down"", which borrowed from Qu Yuan's famous work, ""Li Sao"", ""The road is long and arduous, I will seek up and down."" The road ahead is long, and unremitting pursuit and exploration are the true reflection and secret to the success of small and medium-sized websites. How to turn traffic into profit and how to achieve sustainable development are challenges faced by small and medium-sized websites. As the financial crisis spreads, the future of small and medium-sized websites has also become a hot topic of discussion. The grand scene of a thousand people attending is not often seen in industry conferences in the Internet industry in China, which can be seen from the scale of the small and medium-sized website group and the grassroots webmasters' expectations for the development of the Internet in 2009. The conference invited many successful Internet companies and famous individual website owners, with entrepreneurship and innovation as the main thread, focusing on the entrepreneurial opportunities for small and medium-sized websites, the development trends of the Internet in 2009, and other hot topics such as how small and medium-sized websites can survive and develop in the economic cold winter, and had in-depth exchanges with grassroots website owners. Founder of the Shanghai Station Master Association, Yu Jiaxin, said that the Shanghai Station Master Association is an open, civilian social organization. After integrating the concept of the cultural festival, it aims to hold an Internet conference that guides small and medium-sized websites to write history. The carefully crafted ""one festival and one conference"" provides a good platform for communication and discussion of the challenges and opportunities faced by entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized websites, and also creates an opportunity for a wide range of Internet colleagues to broaden their horizons, obtain information, make friends widely, and share resources."

最低三折网银汇款手续费价格战打响证券时报记者唐晓本报讯为了引导客户使用网上银行，降低银行运营成本，近日交通银行(601328)、民生银行(600016)、光大银行、华夏银行(600015)等银行宣布下调网银汇款手续费，打折幅度低至3折。据了解，同一笔业务给银行带来的成本，网银是柜台的1/6-1/7，网银业务已经受到越来越多银行的重视。网银费率竞相打折近日，交通银行宣布，将个人网银同城跨行汇款手续费率由原来的按汇款金额0.7%下调至0.2%，最高收费由每笔汇款收50元下调至收20元。光大银行则明确宣布，个人网银转账汇款功能中的“本行转账”项、“跨行汇款”项手续费打3折，打折后本行异地转账、跨行汇款手续费由原来的0.5%降至0.15%，手续费上限也相应调低。华夏银行也推出了3-8折不等的优惠，打折范围既包括个人网银也包括企业网银，几乎覆盖该行网银所有转账汇款的功能项目。该优惠方案自4月8日开始执行。据了解，目前银行个人网上银行收费项目主要是转账汇款功能，其他功能除了业务本身收费外，通过网银办理不会加收费用，大部分银行网银目前暂时不收年费。网银业务日益受重视对于多家银行纷纷调低网银汇款手续费，深圳一家银行的电子银行部副总经理认为，是后来者急于通过优惠活动扩大市场规模的举措。网银业务处于推广阶段的银行，可通过此类活动吸引更多的客户使用该行网银。而网银成本低廉、可作为物理网点的重要补充，则是一些银行尤其股份制银行积极推广网银的原因。据悉，同样一笔业务，客户通过网银办理，银行支出的相应成本是柜台的1/6-1/7。随着电子银行功能的逐步完善，包括网银在内的电子银行业务已经为越来越多的人所接受。以工行(601398)为例，工行一季度电子银行交易额达到32万亿元，占该行全部业务量的比重为44.5%，较年初提高1.4个百分点。网银业务费率差异大据了解，即使同一笔网上银行业务，各家银行收费标准差异也较大，如光大银行本行异地转账、跨行汇款的手续费调整前也只有0.5%，调整后更低至0.15%。工行本行异地汇款、跨行汇款的手续费为0.9%，相当于光大银行调整前的1.8倍，调整后的6倍。此外，各家银行针对网银转账汇款业务的收费划分情况也不同，如有的银行本行异地汇款和跨行异地汇款、同城跨行汇款三项业务的手续费率相同，如工行和光大银行。也有银行各项功能收费标准更为细化，如招行(60036)专业版网银收费标准为：同城跨行汇款每笔2块；异地本行汇款收取汇款金额的0.2%，汇往公司账户则收取汇款金额的1%；异地跨行汇款收取汇款金额的1%。	唐晓	正向	"The battle of the lowest three discount online banking transfer fees has begun. According to a report by Securities Times reporter Tang Xiaoxiao, in order to guide customers to use online banking and reduce bank operating costs, several banks such as Bank of Communications (601328), Minsheng Bank (600016), Everbright Bank, and Huarong Bank (600015) have recently announced a reduction in online banking transfer fees, with the discount as low as 30%. It is understood that the cost of the same business to the bank is 1/6-1/7 of the counter, and online banking business has been paid more and more attention by banks. Online banking fees are now discounted. Recently, the Bank of Communications announced that the personal online banking inter-bank transfer fee rate in the same city will be reduced from 0.7% of the transfer amount to 0.2%, and the highest charge will be reduced from 50 yuan per transfer to 20 yuan. ICBC Guangda clearly announced that the handling fees for the ""Intra-bank Transfer"" and ""Inter-bank Transfer"" items in the personal online banking transfer and remittance function would be discounted to 30%, and the handling fees for intra-bank异地transfer and inter-bank remittance would be reduced from 0.5% to 0.15% after the discount, and the upper limit of the handling fees would be correspondingly reduced. The China Huaxia Bank also launched discounts ranging from 3 to 8, which covered both personal and corporate online banking, and almost all the functions of the bank's online banking for transfers and remittances. The promotion will be in effect from April 8th. It is understood that the current charging items of personal online banking of banks are mainly transfer and remittance functions, and other functions will not be charged extra fees through online banking, except for the charges of the business itself. Most banks do not charge annual fees for online banking at present. As online banking business is becoming more and more important, many banks have lowered the online transfer fee. A vice general manager of the electronic banking department of a bank in Shenzhen believes that it is a move by latecomers to expand the market scale through preferential activities. Banks in the promotion stage of online banking can attract more customers to use their online banking through such activities. And the low cost of online banking and its important supplement to physical branches is one of the reasons why some banks, especially shareholding banks, are actively promoting online banking. It is reported that for the same business, customers can handle it through online banking, and the corresponding cost for the bank is 1/6-1/7 of that at the counter. As electronic banking functions are gradually improved, electronic banking services including online banking have been accepted by more and more people. Take ICBC (601398) as an example, ICBC's electronic banking transaction volume in the first quarter reached 32 trillion yuan, accounting for 44.5% of the bank's total business volume, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from the beginning of the year. Online banking service fees vary greatly. It is understood that even for the same online banking transaction, the charging standards of various banks are also quite different. For example, the handling fee for intra-bank异地transfer and inter-bank remittance of China Merchants Bank was only 0.5% before the adjustment, and it is now reduced to 0.15%. ICBC’s intra-bank and inter-bank transfer fee is 0.9%, which is 1.8 times the original of CEB before the adjustment and 6 times the adjusted one. In addition, the charging standards of various banks for online banking transfer and remittance business are different. For example, some banks have the same handling fee rate for three types of business, such as intra-bank intercity remittance, inter-bank intercity remittance, and intra-city inter-bank remittance, such as ICBC and Everbright Bank. There are also more detailed charging standards for various bank functions, such as the professional version of the online banking of China Merchants Bank (60036): 2 yuan for intra-city inter-bank remittance per transaction; 0.2% of the remittance amount for intra-city same-bank remittance, and 1% for remittance to corporate accounts; 1% of the remittance amount for inter-city inter-bank remittance."

联通6月3G新增用户重回高位每经记者胡玉慧中国联通(600050，收盘价5.33元)6月3G用户数据如期回升。数据显示，6月联通3G用户净增数达到185.5万户，结束了此前连续两个月环比下滑的状态，回到今年3月份创下的单月最高点。至此，联通今年上半年的营运成绩单已经明了。期间公司累计新增3G用户988.5万户，月平均增长164.75万户；3G用户总量累计达到2394.5万户，对自身总计1.81亿户移动电话用户的渗透率上升至13.2%。6月用户数据的改善得益于公司营销重心调整，千元智能机在上个月正式上柜销售。近日联通总经理陆益民表示，接下来将继续力推千元智能手机。不过业内指出，年初联通定下了今年新增2500万户3G用户的发展目标。如今2011年已过半，上半年仅完成40%。若要完成预定用户增长目标，接下来6个月，月均新增3G用户数需扩大至252万户。而在今年5月24日召开的年度股东大会上，中国联通董事长常小兵明确表示，“今年公司有信心完成3G新增用户达到2500万户的目标”，甚至“可能超越这一目标”。联通新推的千元智能机营销策略对中低端用户吸引力相当明显。此前联通宣布全额包销的100万台中兴V880，单日最高销量接近万台，整个6月份日均销量接近5000台；以此计算仅这一机型就为公司吸引到15万新用户。中信证券研究员宫俊涛就表示，随着更多千元级别智能终端在7月份推出，将给对用户增长带来积极推动。	胡玉慧,陆益民,常小兵,宫俊涛	正向	"China Unicom's 3G new users in June returned to a high level. Every Journalist Hu Yuhui China Unicom (600050, closing price 5.33 yuan) 3G user data in June returned to a high level. The data shows that the net increase of China Unicom's 3G users in June reached 1.855 million, ending the previous two months of consecutive month-to-month decline and returning to the highest single-month point set in March this year. So far, China Unicom's operating performance for the first half of this year is clear. During the period, the company added 9.885 million 3G users, with an average monthly increase of 1.6475 million; the total number of 3G users reached 23.945 million, and the penetration rate of its total 181 million mobile phone users increased to 13.2%. The improvement in June user data was due to the company's shift in marketing focus, with the launch of a thousand-yuan smart phone for sale last month. Recently, Lu Yimin, the general manager of China Unicom, said that they would continue to promote the thousand-yuan smart phones. However, industry insiders pointed out that China Unicom set a development target of adding 25 million 3G users this year at the beginning of the year. Now that 2011 is halfway through, only 40% of the first half has been completed. To achieve the预定用户增长目标in the next 6 months, the average monthly addition of 3G users needs to be expanded to 2.52 million. At the annual shareholders' meeting held on May 24 this year, the China Unicom chairman, Chang Xiaobing, clearly stated that ""the company is confident to achieve the goal of adding 25 million 3G users this year, and it may even exceed this goal."" The marketing strategy of China Unicom's new RMB 1000 smart phone is very attractive to low and middle-end users. The 100,000 ZTE V880s that China Unicom announced to fully underwrite had a daily sales peak of nearly 10,000 units, with an average daily sales of nearly 5,000 units in June. Calculated by this, this model alone attracted 150,000 new users to the company. Guang Juntao, a researcher from China International Securities, said that with more thousand-yuan-level intelligent terminals launched in July, it will bring positive promotion to user growth."
另类丰胸新体验浴缸里的丰胸按摩导语：想体验一下另类丰胸的感觉吗？如果家里有个浴缸，就能轻松做到。在浴缸中进行胸部按摩，体验一下在水中按摩胸部的感觉。具体步骤如下：1、给浴缸里放水，保证水位刚好高过身体即可，把水的温度控制在40度左右，不要太烫，体温高一点点就可以了。2、躺在浴缸里边，用搓澡浴巾把全身擦洗干净，直到全身有发热的感觉。3、用手按摩乳房，按摩时间在5分钟左右即可。4、拿一把柔软的刷子，从乳房内侧划弧线，往外侧刷洗乳房。5、把水龙头开大，一边冲洗乳房一边刷。6、出浴，坐在浴缸边上，抹上滋润霜，双手按照顺时针的方向轻轻按摩乳房10分钟左右。7、用冷热毛巾交替擦拭乳房，进行冷热刺激，每5分钟换一次。8、如果乳房有些下垂，可以用淋浴喷头从乳房下方向上冲刷，并同时按摩乳房。在以上方法中需要注意的是乳房淋浴按摩，最好是在睡觉前或者起床后洗澡时进行。在按摩的时候不要使用精油或者其他刺激性药物，使用普通的淋浴乳或者香皂液就可以了。按摩前一定要把双手洗干净，如果指甲太长就剪短，否和伤了乳头或者皮肤就不得了了。当然，并不是只有利用盆浴才可以做胸部按摩的，淋浴同样可以进行以上动作，而且从某些方面来说，它要比盆浴更加有利于胸部的发育。如在淋浴时利用喷头用热水和冷水交替着从下往上冲洗来刺激乳房，非常有利于如乳房的丰满和坚挺。因为短时间内的低温刺激，能够有效的改善乳腺组织的机结构，可以提高其张力，进而出尽生长发育。洗完后，趁着身体微热时擦上滋润霜，做个胸部按摩将更加有利于乳房的发育，而且利于淋浴水流对胸部的冲击按摩，不但可以健美乳房，还可以让乳晕的颜色和乳房形状变的更加漂亮。		正向	Alternative breast enhancement experience in the bathtub: Would you like to experience the feeling of alternative breast enhancement? If there is a bathtub at home, it can be done easily. Have a chest massage in the bathtub and experience the feeling of getting a chest massage in water. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Fill the bathtub with water and ensure that the water level is just above the body. Control the water temperature to about 40 degrees, not too hot, just a little higher than body temperature is fine. Lie in the bathtub and clean your whole body with a loofah until you feel warm all over. 3. Massage your breasts by hand for about 5 minutes. 4. Use a soft brush to brush the breasts from the inner side to the outer side in an arc. 5. Turn on the tap and brush while rinsing the breasts. 6. After getting out of the bath, sit on the edge of the bathtub, apply moisturizing cream, and gently massage your breasts in a clockwise direction for about 10 minutes with both hands. 7. Alternate between cold and hot towels to wipe the breasts and perform cold and hot stimulation, changing every 5 minutes. 8. If the breasts are a little drooping, you can use the showerhead to rinse from below the breasts upwards and massage the breasts at the same time. It should be noted that breast shower massage should be done before going to bed or after getting up in the morning when taking a shower. Do not use essential oils or other irritant drugs during massage, ordinary shower gel or soap liquid is enough. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before the massage, and if your nails are too long, cut them short to avoid hurting the nipple or skin. Of course, it is not only by using a bathtub that you can do breast massage, you can also do the above actions in the shower, and from some aspects, it is more beneficial to the development of the breasts than a bathtub. If you use the showerhead to alternate between hot and cold water from bottom to top to stimulate the breasts when taking a shower, it is very beneficial for the fullness and firmness of the breasts. Due to the short-term low-temperature stimulation, it can effectively improve the mechanical structure of mammary tissue, increase its tension, and thus promote growth and development. After washing, apply a moisturizing cream while your body is still slightly warm, and do a breast massage, which will be more beneficial for the development of the breasts, and also for the shower water to massage the breasts. Not only can it make the breasts more beautiful, but it can also make the color of the areola and the shape of the breasts more beautiful.
基金提前潜伏业绩暴增股216家公司中期预增翻番记者高丽霞2011年中报就将在本周拉开帷幕了。统计显示，今年中期的业绩预告中，喜多忧少。靓丽的中报业绩惹得市场蠢蠢欲动，也成为近期市场向上的主要动力。记者统计发现，在已经披露业绩预告的上市公司中，216家公司业绩翻番，而基金早于今年一季度就开始重仓布局就有146只。超六成公司业绩翻番Wind统计显示，截至昨日两市共有905家公司发布了今年中期的业绩预告，其中预增的个股多达714只，占比接近80%，业绩翻番的个股也多达216只。在这216只中期业绩暴增的个股中，基金于今年一季度重仓持有的就有146只。在沪深两市中报业绩增幅排行榜中，增长幅度在100倍以上的共有四家公司。上海新梅(600732)、恒逸石化(000703)、新华联(000620)、青海明胶(000606)分列前四位。不过这四只个股业绩的大幅增长均不是由于主营收入增长所带来的，要么是出售股权所获得的收益，要么是沾了重组的光。对于这种业绩变相暴增的公司，基金似乎兴趣不大，一季度这四只业绩增幅最大的个股均未获得基金的“光顾”。上海新梅同比业绩增幅105370%，位居两市之首。去年中期上海新梅仅实现净利润6.16万元。但今年中期公司预计2011年半年度归属于上市公司股东的净利润为5500万元—6500万元。业绩大幅增长主要是由于公司转让上海新兰房地产开发有限公司股权所产生的投资收益得以确认，且报告期内结转的营业收入增加。或许是由于业绩增长主要是来源于股权转让，而并非公司经营业绩的好转，上海新梅在二级市场上并无突出表现，此外一季度各大基金均没有光顾这只股票。排名第二是去年中小板新上市的恒逸石化，其预计今年中期将实现净利润11.24亿元—12.36亿元。不过，恒逸石化业绩的大幅增长，却是沾了重组的光。重组完成后的6月11日，恒逸石化即发布了业绩预盈公告，预计2011上半年实现净利润为11.24亿元-12.36亿元，半年的净利润已超过全年的业绩承诺。公司股价也从去年启动重组之初的10元左右，上涨至目前的44元附近，并曾经在今年4月中旬创下过54.50元的高点。新华联以19352%的业绩增幅暂居第三位。新华联的业绩增长也是来源于重组，公司借壳停牌了长达五年之久的S*ST圣方。新华联一复牌，在涨幅不受限制的复牌首日即恐怖大涨，从1.17元/股一口气狂涨到10.52元/股。此外，中期业绩增长在100倍以上的还有青海明胶，公司预计上半年实现净利润约3700万元，同比增长14478.41%。这一变化是由于公司转让四川禾正制药有限责任公司股权并确认相应收入而致。今年中期业绩增长幅度在10倍以上的公司还有冠福家用(002102)、ST张家界(000430)、美欣达(002034)、天伦置业(000711)、西安旅游(000610)等18只；业绩增长幅度在5至10倍的则有经纬纺机(000666)、维科精华(600152)、山东海化(000822)、美邦服饰(002269)、太极实业(600667)等22只。基金重仓提前布局在这216家一季度业绩增长至少一倍的个股中，基金于去年四季度重仓的就多达146只，占比高达68%。其中威孚高科(000581)赢得了众多的基金的青睐。截至一季度末，共有34只基金持有威孚高科，基金合计持股13013.51万股。不过与上期相比，基金还是减持了7246万股。华夏、易方达旗下均有四只基金持有威孚高科，分别合计持股2773.88万股、1409.57万股。南方基金旗下更是有5只基金持有该股，此外去年的冠军产品华商盛世成长也持有1109.73万股，其同门基金华商策略精选则持有897.17万股。一季度潜伏在金发科技(600143)的基金也多达32只，合计持有20542.04万股。兴业基金、信诚基金旗下各有四只产品均重仓持有该股，其中兴业基金持股最多，合计持股5037.56万股。东吴基金旗下更是有5只产品持有该股，合计持有1280.39万股。一季度末潜伏的基金数在20家以上的还有包钢稀土(600111)、中集集团(000039)、广汇股份(600256)、天山股份(000877)。获得10只-20只基金潜伏的则有中国北车(601299)、双鹭药业(002038)、金螳螂(002081)、山东黄金(600547)、辰州矿业(002155)、中恒集团(600252)、中环股份(002129)等21只个股。从行业分布来看，基金一季度末最青睐的行业是石油化学塑料塑胶，在这216只业绩翻番的公司中，石油化学塑料塑胶行业的就有31家，其次是机械设备仪表，基金一季度提前潜伏的有20家，第三位是金属、非金属行业，有19家。	高丽霞	正向	The funds have been lying in wait for the performance of 216 companies with a huge increase in the first half of the year.

Journalists have found that among the listed companies that have disclosed their earnings forecasts, 216 companies have doubled their performance, and 146 of them were heavily invested in early this quarter. More than 60% of companies have doubled their earnings. According to Wind statistics, as of yesterday, a total of 905 listed companies have released their earnings forecasts for this year's mid-term, among which there are as many as 714 stocks with increased earnings, accounting for nearly 80%, and there are also as many as 216 stocks with earnings doubling. Of the 216 stocks with significantly increased interim earnings, 146 were heavily held by funds in the first quarter of this year. There are four companies with a growth rate of more than 100 times in the ranking of the growth rate of the semi-annual reports of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Shanghai Xinmei (600732), Hengyi Petrochemical (000703), Xinhua Group (000620), and Qinghai Mingjiao (000606) ranked in the top four. But the substantial growth in the performance of these four individual stocks was not due to an increase in main business revenue, but either from the gains from the sale of equity or from the restructuring. For companies with such a dramatic increase in performance, funds do not seem to be very interested, and none of the top four performers in the first quarter received the attention of funds. Shanghai Xinmei's year-on-year performance growth ranked first in the two cities at 105370%. Shanghai Xinmei only realized a net profit of 61,600 yuan in the middle of last year. But the company expects its net profit attributable to owners of the parent for the first half of 2011 to be between RMB55 million and RMB65 million. The substantial increase in performance was mainly due to the recognition of investment income from the transfer of shares in Shanghai Xinlan Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., and an increase in revenue from operations carried forward during the reporting period. Perhaps because the growth in performance mainly came from share transfer rather than the improvement of the company's operating performance, Shanghai Xinmei did not have a prominent performance in the secondary market, and in addition, no major funds visited this stock in the first quarter. Ranked second is Hengyi Petrochemical, which listed on the SME board last year, and it is expected to achieve a net profit of 1.124 billion to 1.236 billion yuan in the first half of this year. However, Hengyi’s strong performance was largely due to the restructuring. On June 11, 2011, after the completion of the reorganization, Hengyi Petrochemical immediately issued a profit forecast announcement, expecting to achieve a net profit of 1.124 billion yuan-1.236 billion yuan in the first half of 2011, and the net profit of half a year has exceeded the annual performance commitment. The company's stock price has risen from around 10 yuan at the beginning of the restructuring last year to around 44 yuan at present, and it once reached a high of 54.50 yuan in mid-April this year. China Resources Land ranks third with a performance increase of 193.52%. The performance growth of Xinhua Group also comes from restructuring, and the company has been on a long-term suspension of S*ST Shifang for five years. Once Xinhua Group resumed trading, it experienced a huge increase on the first day of resumption, when the stock price soared from 1.17 yuan per share to 10.52 yuan per share. In addition, Qinghai Mingjiao also saw a more than 100-fold increase in mid-term performance, with the company expecting to achieve a net profit of about 37 million yuan in the first half of the year, up 14478.41% year-on-year. This change is due to the company's transfer of equity in Sichuan Hezhen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and the recognition of corresponding income. There are 18 companies, such as Guanfu Household (002102), ST Zhangjiajie (000430), Meixin达 (002034), Tianrun Real Estate (000711), Xi'an Tourism (000610), etc., with a growth rate of more than 10 times in the mid-term performance this year; and 22 companies, such as Jingwei Textile Machinery (000666), Weike Essence (600152), Shandong Haihua (000822), Meibang Apparel (002269), Taishidao Industry (600667), etc., with a growth rate of 5 to 10 times. The funds had already positioned themselves in advance in these 216 individual stocks with a minimum one-fold increase in first-quarter performance. There were as many as 146 funds that were heavily weighted in the fourth quarter of last year, accounting for as high as 68%. Among them, Weifang High-tech (000581) won the favor of many funds. By the end of the first quarter, a total of 34 funds held Wufei High-tech, with a combined holding of 130,135,100 shares. But the fund still reduced its holdings by 72.46 million shares compared to the previous issue. Huaxia and Yifangda each have four funds holding Weifeng High-tech, respectively holding a total of 27.7388 million shares and 14.0957 million shares. There are five funds under Southern Fund holding the stock, and the champion product of last year, Huashang Shengshi Growth, holds 11,097,300 shares, while its sister fund, Huashang Strategy Selection, holds 8,971,700 shares. There were as many as 32 funds lurking in Jinhua Technology (600143) in the first quarter, holding a total of 205,420,400 shares. Four products under Xingye Fund and Xincheng Fund each heavily held the stock, among which Xingye Fund held the most shares, with a total of 50,375,600 shares. There are five products under the East Wu Fund holding the stock, with a total of 12.8039 million shares held. At the end of the first quarter, there were still funds lurking in more than 20 companies, including Baotou Rare Earth (600111), COSCO Group (000039), Guanghui Corporation (600256), and Tianshan Corporation (000877). Obtaining 10-20 funds in ambush have China North Rail (601299), Shuanglu Pharmaceutical (002038), Jin Tanglang (002081), Shandong Gold (600547), Chen Zhou Mining (002155), Zhongheng Group (600252), Zhonghuan Semiconductor (002129), and 21 other stocks. In terms of industry distribution, the funds favored the petrochemical, plastic and rubber industries most at the end of the first quarter. There were 31 companies in the petrochemical, plastic and rubber industries among the 216 companies with double returns, followed by the machinery and instruments industry, with 20 companies that the funds had been lurking in advance, and the third was the metal and non-metal industry, with 19 companies.
驻日美军战斗飞行队可能迁至韩国部署训练中新网3月22日电据韩联社报道，因日本大地震和核电站泄漏影响，驻日美国空军第35战斗飞行团属下的F-16战斗机部队可能会选择在韩国等其他地区部署和进行训练。美国《星条旗报(StarsandStripes)》22日报道称，第35战斗飞行团长麦克·罗德斯坦因上校19日在基地表示，为了继续进行训练，有必要将第14战斗飞行队的驾驶员和维修人员派往韩国等其他地区，进行部署和训练。他还说，三?基地有可能会成为日本地震赈灾物资的枢纽基地，所以F-16战斗机需要另寻其他训练场地。报道称，罗德斯坦并没有具体指出对外部署的准确时间表，只表示对外部署的时间大约为两周到一个月。三?基地位于日本发生大地震的东北地区，离福岛核电站约300公里。有分析认为，第14战斗机飞行大队可能因核辐射在寻地避难。据悉，离福岛核电站约260公里的美国海军厚木基地曾于17至18日进行调遣，将1000多兵力和部分飞机迁往关岛的安德逊基地。	麦克·罗德斯坦因,罗德斯坦	正向	The US combat flight team in Japan may move to Korea for training and deployment due to the impact of the earthquake and nuclear leakage in Japan. On March 22, 2011, the US Air Force 35th Combat Flight Group under the US Air Force in Japan may choose to deploy and train in other regions such as Korea. Stars and Stripes reported on February 22 that Colonel Mike Rodenstein, commander of the 35th Fighter Wing, said on base on the 19th that in order to continue training, it was necessary to deploy the pilots and maintenance personnel of the 14th Fighter Wing to other regions such as South Korea for training. He also said that al-Qaeda could become a hub for earthquake relief supplies for Japan, so the F-16s would need to find other training grounds. Reports said that Rodenstein did not specify the exact time schedule for the external deployment, only saying that the external deployment would take about two to one month. The three?base is located in the northeast of Japan, which experienced a major earthquake, about 300 kilometers away from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Some analysis suggests that the 14th Fighter Aviation Regiment may be seeking shelter from nuclear radiation. It is reported that the US Navy’s Koto base, about 260 kilometers away from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, relocated more than 1,000 troops and some aircraft to Andersen base in Guam on the 17th and 18th.

A couple was robbed of 62,000 yuan in cash by a man with a fake gun at a self-service bank of the Construction Bank at the intersection of Qingweili Road and Yingwudao in Hankyang at around 11:05 pm on the 25th. After the incident, dozens of police officers searched for the robber overnight, and they caught him and recovered 45,000 yuan in about 10 hours. At the time, Mr. Dong and his wife carried a large amount of cash to the self-service bank to transfer money. When about 10,000 yuan was deposited, a man about 30 years old and 1.75 meters tall snatched Mr. Dong's plastic bag. Mr. Dong and his wife fought back, seized the man's weapon, and the robber took away the plastic bag containing cash. Mr. Dong chased and shouted for help, and his wife hurried to call the police. The robber ran for dozens of meters, jumped over the iron fence of the bank, and entered the bank's back yard, then jumped over the courtyard wall and entered the nearby flat field residential area. Mr. Dong and his wife could not catch up and found that the ""handgun"" was actually a lighter shaped like a gun. After the incident, dozens of police officers arrived at the scene, surrounded Pingtian community, and searched suspicious places. The whole process of the man robbing the customer was recorded by the bank's video camera. After investigation, it was found that the man rented a house in a residential area near the scene, and snatched 62,000 yuan in cash from Mr. Dong and his wife. Soon, Lin Mou from Shanxi Province was identified as a major suspect. At around 9 a.m. yesterday, Lin was arrested by the police near Minsheng Road in Hankou about 10 hours after the incident, and 45,000 yuan in cash was recovered. It is alleged that Lin did not find a job in Hankou and was preparing to rob and leave Hankou. Yesterday morning, the reporters saw that the four cash dispensers of the self-service bank were operating normally, and customers were queuing up in front of the cash dispensers.

雨枫：九城不会因为失去魔兽而倒下新浪科技讯4月16日晚间消息，网络游戏业内人士雨枫今日与新浪科技连线时表示，虽然九城在失去魔兽世界代理权之后，短期内会亏损。但按照九城目前的条件，不会因为此事倒下。以下为对话实录：新浪科技：在这场风波中，九城是不是最大的输家？最大的赢家是网易还是暴雪？雨枫：我觉得输家只有九城一家，所以这里没有最大的输家。最大的赢家是暴雪，而不是网易。但九城的失败是失去了绝大多数收入，但是在过去的四年时间里面，九城靠运营魔兽世界这款产品实现了上市、拿到了巨额现金、也拿到了EA公司的产品代理权。如果我们斤斤从过去四年的这个结果来看，也只能说“不圆满”，而不是输了。为什么说网易不是最大的赢家呢？因为我们都知道九城当年签下这个产品的时候，代价已经很高了。今天暴雪把这个产品又交到网易手里，我想网易开出的条件应该不会比当年差。而九城在过去四年里面，利润一直不是很高。这里就有一个问题，网易运营魔兽世界会不会带来丰厚的利润？目前，我自己和一些业内的朋友的判断是，网易的收益未必会比九城的高。当初网易运营战网的时候，业内问的问题主要是对网易的财务有什么影响，因为战网模式在国内还是有很多现实的困难。现在网易花掉很高的代价将魔兽世界这个游戏拿下，那网易和暴雪会将这款游戏作为一个重要的收入来源。因为战网不一定能够带来大量收入，但是魔兽世界可以。问题是今天网易付出的代价会比九城当年付出的代价高，从九城过去四年的财报来看，魔兽世界的毛利不是很高，而且九城在很多方面受到暴雪的制约。实际上，暴雪抓住了九城的一个命门，九城没有别的收入来源，暴雪就可以任意地提价。这件事情要是放在网易和丁磊身上，就魔兽世界这个产品来讲，他讨价还价的能力未必比九城多多少。虽然网易可以说公司比较大，收入比较分散。但暴雪还是占据了一个相对主动的位置。新浪科技：现在已经确认的是，九城失去了魔兽世界这款游戏，对于他们来说，短期和长期有何影响？雨枫：从短期上来讲，这对九城来说是一件坏事。超过95%的收入来源没有了，这点没有什么疑问。从长期来讲，这对九城来说未必是一件坏事。对于九城来说，魔兽世界这款游戏是一个太大的存在。因为有了魔兽，它把九城所能拿出来的资源、能力和管理人员的精力完全吸引过去。这种状态下，九城想做一些别的事情是有难度的。在过去四年里，九城拿到了行业里大量被看好的产品，但是一直都没有成功。除了产品本身的问题之外，我们回过头来想，这里是不是存在一个九城“拆东墙补西墙”的情况。由于魔兽带来了95%的收入，就不得不先保证它的运营。这样一来，新产品的上线和运营就有一定的削弱。现在九城没有了魔兽，公司在短期是亏损了。但要看一下九城本身，他拥有3亿多的现金，他背后站着EA。那九城会因为这件事情倒下吗？或者退市吗？大不了重新开始。但现在这个时间点上，九城已经比四年前的条件好了不知多少呗，我认为九城不吃亏。新浪科技：为什么九城用了4年的时间，却仍然摆脱不了对魔兽的依赖？雨枫：从朱骏拿下魔兽在中国的代理权第一天开始，他就在考虑如何摆脱对这款游戏的依赖，这也是过去四年里面九城一直在做的事情。从财务的角度来看，他没有做成。原因让我来分析的话，有如下原因。第一，九城的运营能力。这里包括了市场推广和客户服务，也包括与政府部门的沟通能力。在过去这四年里，九城运营团队的能力并没有得到提高，这是非常失误的一点。另外一点，产品线选择的问题。九城选择的产品主要是大家都看好的大产品。但业界除了魔兽这样的大产品，也有一些不出名但很成功的小产品。九城把过多的精力放在了海外游戏的代理上，而没有将眼光投向国内，寻找那些更适合中国玩家习惯的产品。新浪科技：网易将如何实现产品的过渡？网易到底为什么要代理魔兽这款游戏？雨枫：刚才我们分析过，从财务上来讲，虽然魔兽这款游戏是有钱可赚，但丁磊没有像当年朱骏那样，他非得要拿下这个产品才能实现某种目的这个地步。没有魔兽，对于网易来讲无关痛痒。有了魔兽，对于网易来讲也就是10%到20%的成长机会。这个问题我至今也没有想清楚，我认为丁磊不是冲着利润去的。在过去的一两年，网易在产品开发上遇到了一定的挫折。像《大唐豪侠》和《天下2》这些产品都没有做起来，而且《天下2》是魔兽世界的正面竞争产品。但很明显，这个产品是失败的。虽然说网易这几年做《梦幻西游》和《大话》做得顺风顺水，但游戏之外的业务收入还是很少，门户业务和有道搜索的收入一直不稳定。其实代理魔兽这件事情是一个信号。网易成立了杭州研究院，核心是研发免费游戏。而现在他不仅做免费游戏，还在做代理游戏。这就是网易战略转型的信号，未来可能不再把自己局限为研发和运营游戏的运营商，他可能把自己放在一个更大的平台上。但暴雪的立场是很强硬的，如果依靠暴雪来转型，我相信这里有巨大的困难。新浪科技：在今年6月，九城的授权就会到期。能否预测一下用户资料将会怎么处理？雨枫：这件事情说法很多，有一种说法是这样：从合同角度来看，当初的合约规定所有的用户资料都在暴雪手中。因为当时包括盛大在内都在争夺这款游戏，但只有九城什么都没有，如果不能拿到这款游戏就无法生存下去。现在来看，这个条款是很亏本的。(于连)	雨枫,九城,魔兽,丁磊,朱骏,于连	正向	"Yufeng: Nine City will not fall because of the loss of World of Warcraft. Sina Tech News, April 16, 2019 - The online game industry insider Yufeng said in a live interview with Sina Tech today that although Nine City will suffer losses in the short term after losing the agency rights of World of Warcraft. But with Nine City’s current conditions, it will not fall because of this. The following is a dialogue transcript: Sina Technology: Is iCity the biggest loser in this storm? Who is the biggest winner, NetEase or Blizzard? Yufeng: I think there is only 9 City as the loser, so there is no biggest loser here. The biggest winner is Blizzard, not NetEase. But the loss for Nine City was the vast majority of its revenue, but in the past four years, Nine City has gone public, obtained huge cash, and also obtained the agency rights of EA’s products by operating World of Warcraft. If we look at the results of the past four years, we can only say that it is ""imperfect"" and not that we have lost. Why is it not NetEase that is the biggest winner? As we all know, the price Nine City paid for this product back then was already very high. Today Blizzard handed this product back to NetEase, and I think NetEase's terms this time should not be worse than before. And for the past four years, NetEase's profits have not been very high. Is there a problem here, will operating World of Warcraft by NetEase bring in substantial profits? Currently, my own judgment and that of some friends in the industry is that NetEase's revenue may not be higher than that of 91 Wireless. When NetEase operated Battle.net, the industry's questions were mainly about the impact on NetEase's finances, because the Battle.net model still had many practical difficulties in China. Now that NetEase is paying a high price to acquire World of Warcraft, NetEase and Blizzard will regard this game as an important source of income. Because the Battle.net may not bring in a lot of revenue, but World of Warcraft can. The question is whether NetEase will pay a higher price today than Nine City did in the past four years, as the gross profit margin of World of Warcraft is not high, and Nine City was also constrained by Blizzard in many aspects. In fact, Blizzard had caught Nine City’s Achilles’ heel: with no other sources of income, Nine City could only allow Blizzard to raise prices at will. If this matter were to be placed on NetEase and Ding Lei, in terms of the World of Warcraft product, his haggling ability might not be much more than Nine City. Though NetEase can be said to be a large company with more dispersed income. But Blizzard still held a relatively advantageous position. Sina Tech: Now that it has been confirmed that Nine City has lost World of Warcraft, what impact will this have on them in the short and long term? Yufeng: In the short term, this is bad for Netease. There is no doubt that over 95% of the sources of income have disappeared. In the long term, it may not be a bad thing for NINE CITY. World of Warcraft is too big for Nine City. Because of World of Warcraft, all of Nine City’s resources, capabilities, and the energy of its management staff were completely absorbed. In this state, it was difficult for Nine City to do something else. In the past four years, 9城 has received a large number of industry products that were highly anticipated, but has never succeeded. Besides the problems with the product itself, we wonder whether there is a situation where 9 City is “borrowing from Peter to pay Paul”. Since World of Warcraft accounted for 95% of the revenue, it had to be ensured that it was operating first. In this way, the launch and operation of new products are somewhat weakened. Now that Nine City no longer has World of Warcraft, the company is losing money in the short term. But looking at Nine City itself, it has over 300 million in cash, and EA stands behind it. Will those nine cities fall because of this? Or delist? Start over if necessary. But at this point in time, Nine City is much better off than it was four years ago, and I think that Nine City is not at a disadvantage. Sina Tech: Why did Netease still rely on World of Warcraft after four years? Yufeng: Zhu Jun has been considering how to get rid of his dependence on this game since he took over the agency rights of Warcraft in China, which is also what 9 City has been doing for the past four years. From a financial perspective, he did not succeed. If I were to analyze the reasons, there would be the following reasons. First, Nine City's operational capabilities. It includes market promotion and customer service, as well as the ability to communicate with government departments. Over the past four years, the operational team of Nine City has not improved its capabilities, which is a very serious mistake. Another point is the issue of product line selection. Nine Cities chose mainly the big products that everyone was looking forward to. But in the industry, in addition to big products like World of Warcraft, there are also some small, but very successful, unknown products. Nine City put too much energy into the agency of overseas games, and did not look at the domestic market to find products that are more suitable for Chinese players. Sina Technology: How will NetEase achieve the transition of its products? Why does NetEase have to operate this World of Warcraft game? Yufeng: We have analyzed that, from a financial perspective, although World of Warcraft is a profitable game, Ding Lei did not have to take over this product to achieve a certain goal like Zhu Jun did. Without World of Warcraft, it would be nothing to NetEase. With World of Warcraft, that would be a 10% to 20% growth opportunity for NetEase.  I still haven't figured out this problem, and I think Ding Lei is not for profit. In the past one or two years, NetEase has encountered some setbacks in product development. Products like ""Tang Dynasty Hero"" and ""Heavenly Dynasty 2"" did not succeed, and ""Heavenly Dynasty 2"" was a direct competitor to World of Warcraft. But it was clearly a failure. While NetEase has been doing well with梦幻西游and 大话in recent years, the revenue from its business outside of games has been very little. The income from portal and Youdao search has been unstable. Actually, the agency of World of Warcraft was a signal. NetEase established Hangzhou Research Institute, which focuses on developing free games. And now, in addition to free games, he is also doing agency games. This is a signal of NetEase's strategic transformation, which may no longer confine itself to being an operator of game development and operation, but place itself on a larger platform. But Blizzard's position is very firm, and I believe there are huge difficulties here if we rely on Blizzard to transform. Sina Technology: In June this year, NINE CITY's license will expire. Can you predict how the user data will be processed? Yufeng: There are many ways to talk about this matter. One of the ways of talking is as follows: From the perspective of the contract, the original contract stipulated that all user data was in Blizzard's hands. Because at that time, apart from Shanda, everyone was competing for this game, but only Netease had nothing. If it could not get this game, it could not survive. Now, this clause is very unprofitable. (Coulibaly)"
民生证券：资金面不低头A股难抬头□民生证券研究所策略团队上调存准率之后，加息预期再起，市场由此也出现了连续破位下跌的走势。本周二公开市场一年期央票利率继续走高10BP，由于已在市场预期之内，市场反应较为平淡，我们预计6月到7月央行还会再次加息。在资金面压力依然较大，而物价回落及政策转向信号并未出现之前，市场筑底的格局不会改变，投资者可逢低布局大消费、业绩确定的成长股和航空板块。经济增速温和走低5月经济数据进一步验证了我们对于未来经济的判断，即去库存周期下，经济增速进一步温和走低。5月工业增加值同比增长13.3%，在4月13.4%的基础上低位趋稳。5月消费和出口实际增速明显回落，但投资需求依然旺盛，实际增速继续上行，预计宏观经济将于三季度实现软着陆。从三驾马车的表现来看，投资需求旺盛，终端消费增速继续放缓。5月份，社会消费品零售总额同比增长16.9%，低于市场17.4%的同比增速预期，较4月回落0.2个百分点。扣除出口价格提高和人民币升值的影响，5月出口实际增长2.5%，比4月回落9.5个百分点。5月投资需求依然旺盛，剔除投资价格上涨因素，5月投资实际增长19.0%，比4月提高0.6个百分点。“提准”重挫资金面自5月中旬上调准备金率以来，银行体系的流动性持续偏紧。6月14日央行再次提高存款准备金率，从而令本已偏紧的资金面进一步趋紧。本次调准后货币市场资金利率再次大幅走高，并带动国债收益率上行。6月21日SHIBOR7天利率已经飙升至8.33%，创今年2月以来的新高，Shibor隔夜利率也上升至7.14%的高位。我们认为，6月底之前宏观资金面压力不会减轻，短期资金利率波动将加大。首先，由于6月份是银行半年度报表考核的关键时期，因此本身就是传统的资金需求旺季；其次，由于一季度末金融机构超储率为1.5%，预计本次提准后银行超储率将进一步降低，对资金面的边际影响会明显放大；再次，商业银行实施日均存贷比考核使得银行月末腾挪表外资产的策略失效；最后，由于上一次提准造成的流动性的紧张局面还未得以缓解，此次存准的上调无论是从资金存量还是心理预期方面，都将进一步放大短期资金利率的波动。物价拐点隐现紧缩政策趋于谨慎5月CPI同比上涨5.5%，创下34个月以来的新高。但从环比数据来看，物价走势出现了一些积极的变化，其中PPI环比上涨0.3%，较4月环比回落了0.2%，原材料购进价格也出现了0.5%的环比回落。在翘尾因素的影响下，CPI有可能在6、7月份再创本轮通胀的新高，但之后物价将缓慢回落，四季度有望明显回落，预计今年11月和12月CPI同比涨幅将回落至4%左右。从通胀走势来看，如果下半年通胀压力真能有效缓解，物价下行将是大概率事件。从经济下行风险来看，目前阶段实体经济已经出现了经济下行的迹象，且微观调研数据表明实体经济的需求也已呈现出下行迹象。从货币紧缩的程度来看，准备金率上调和预期内的一次加息对经济的调控作用将边际递增。故我们预计通胀环比下降将是政策拐点的催化剂，从时间上看，2011年7、8月份紧缩政策仍将继续谨慎。8月前筑底格局难改我们预计6月资金压力将维持高位，短期市场仍将延续筑底格局。受翘尾因素的影响，6月CPI存在继续上冲的风险，但食品价格将于下半年趋稳，同比涨幅回落，预计物价将于6-7月见顶、8月份回落。在通胀拐点可期、经济回落的背景下，下半年紧缩政策的进一步实施趋于谨慎。在通胀回落没有得到数据验证之前，市场对通胀的压力仍然难以释怀，短期市场继续筑底。不过，我们认为，8月以后市场有望迎来反转行情，全年将演绎“N”型走势。8月份以后，通胀回落趋于明朗，政策的核心将由控物价转向稳增长、促转型，宏观经济也将于三季度触底。届时，投资者预期向好，制约市场的力量将显著减轻，8月份以后市场有望迎来趋势性的反转行情。我们看好经济结构转型背景下的食品饮料、商贸、家电等大消费板块、以计算机信息服务为代表的新兴成长板块、受益于人民币加速升值，以及即将进入旺季的航空板块，建议积极布局。点击进入[上证指数吧]讨论		正向	CSMCM: Funds Face Refuses to Yield, A Share Market Will Not Rise. □ After the CSMCM Research Institute Strategy Team raised the reserve requirement ratio, the expectation of interest rate hikes has risen again, and the market has therefore seen a continuous break and fall. The one-year central bank bill interest rate in the open market continued to rise by 10BP this Tuesday. As it was within the market's expectation, the market's reaction was rather calm. We expect the PBOC to raise interest rates again in June and July. Before the pressure on the funding face remains significant and the signals of price declines and policy shifts have not yet appeared, the market's bottom-building pattern will not change. Investors can layout large consumption, performance-determined growth stocks, and the aviation sector at lower levels. Growth in the economy slowed moderately in May, with economic data for the month further confirming our judgment that economic growth will continue to slow moderately in the inventory cycle. Industrial added value in May grew 13.3% year on year, stabilizing at a low level from 13.4% in April. Consumer spending and exports showed a significant slowdown in May, but investment demand remained strong, with actual growth continuing to rise. It is expected that the macroeconomy will achieve a soft landing in the third quarter. From the performance of the three horses, investment demand is strong, and the growth rate of final consumption continues to slow down. In May, the year-on-year growth rate of social consumer goods retail sales was 16.9%, lower than the expected year-on-year growth rate of 17.4% in the market, and 0.2 percentage points lower than in April. After deducting the impact of the increase in export prices and the appreciation of the RMB, the actual growth of exports in May was 2.5%, a decline of 9.5 percentage points from April. Investment demand remained strong in May, and after excluding the impact of investment price increases, actual investment growth in May was 19.0%, up 0.6 percentage points from April. The Prudent Deposit Ratio Has Severely Tightened Liquidity Since the end of mid-May, the liquidity of the banking system has been persistently tight. On June 14, the central bank raised the reserve requirement ratio again, making the already tight liquidity even tighter. After this adjustment, the interest rate of the money market funds rose sharply again, which in turn pushed up the yield of government bonds. On June 21, the 7-day SHIBOR interest rate has surged to 8.33%, reaching a new high since February this year, and the overnight SHIBOR interest rate has also risen to a high of 7.14%. We believe that the pressure on the macro funding situation will not ease before the end of June, and the fluctuation of short-term funding rates will increase. First, since June is the key period for the semi-annual financial report assessment of banks, it is traditionally the peak season for funding demand; second, since the excess reserve ratio of financial institutions at the end of the first quarter is 1.5%, it is expected that the excess reserve ratio of banks will further decrease after this reserve requirement ratio adjustment, and the marginal impact on the funding situation will be significantly increased; third, the daily average deposit-loan ratio assessment implemented by commercial banks makes the strategy of banks to shuffle off-balance sheet assets at the end of the month ineffective; finally, since the liquidity tension caused by the previous reserve requirement ratio adjustment has not yet been alleviated, the increase in the reserve requirement ratio this time will further amplify the short-term interest rate fluctuation from both the perspective of funding stock and psychological expectation. The turning point of the price index is emerging, and the tight monetary policy is becoming more cautious. In May, the year-on-year increase of CPI was 5.5%, reaching a new high in 34 months. But from the perspective of the month-on-month data, there were some positive changes in the price trend, with PPI rising by 0.3% month-on-month, a decline of 0.2% compared to April, and the purchase price of raw materials also fell by 0.5% month-on-month. Affected by the翘尾因素, the CPI may set a new high for this round of inflation in June and July, but prices will slowly fall back after that, and it is expected to fall significantly in the fourth quarter. It is expected that the year-on-year growth rate of the CPI in November and December this year will fall back to around 4%. Based on the trend of inflation, if the inflation pressure can really be effectively alleviated in the second half of the year, the decline in prices is a high-probability event. From the perspective of economic downturn risks, the real economy has already shown signs of economic downturn at this stage, and micro-research data also indicate that the demand in the real economy has shown signs of downturn. In terms of the degree of monetary tightening, the increase in the reserve requirement ratio and a surprise interest rate hike will have a marginal increase in the regulatory effect on the economy. So we expect that a moderation in the rate of inflation will be the catalyst for a policy pivot, with tightening measures continuing cautiously through July and August 2011. The bottom pattern before August is difficult to change. We expect that the funding pressure will remain at a high level in June, and the market will continue to form a bottom pattern in the short term. Affected by the lagging effect, the CPI in June is at risk of continuing to rise, but food prices are expected to stabilize in the second half of the year, with a decline in year-on-year growth, and it is expected that prices will peak in June-July and fall in August. With the inflation peak in sight and the economy slowing down, the implementation of further tightening policies in the second half of the year is becoming more cautious. Until the inflation decline is validated by data, the market is still unable to shake off the pressure of inflation, and the short-term market will continue to consolidate its bottom. However, we believe that the market may turn around after August, and the whole year will play out in an “N” shape. After August, the decline in inflation will become clearer, and the core of policy will shift from controlling prices to stabilizing growth and promoting transformation, and the macroeconomy will bottom out in the third quarter. At that time, with investors' expectations turning positive, the forces constraining the market will significantly ease, and the market may see a trend reversal after August. We are optimistic about the consumption sector, including food and beverages, commerce and home appliances, the new growth sector represented by computer information services, and the aviation sector that will enter the peak season due to the acceleration of the RMB appreciation, and we suggest active layout.

小物件大乐趣实用家具装扮新年生活农历新年到了，各家各户都在忙碌地准备着新年的居家用品，很多消费者都会在年前选择一些小茶几、休闲椅、小玄关柜等小件家具来装扮爱家，这些小家具实用且养眼，很适合新年居家使用。小茶几增添几分温暖新年里，难免会有亲朋好久的聚会，两三人的小聚，一款用来摆放茶水、点心的小茶几就很有必要。浅淡木色茶几或原木茶几非常适合与现今流行的浅色系列沙发相配，其造型简单，但讲究精致，色调温和，没有繁杂的功能，和简洁明快的沙发相配，展现出居室的唯美。这些小茶几可根据使用需要灵活地挪动它们，生活中也多了一份方便和轻松，为改换客厅的样子提供了方便，家人、朋友在新年里也会得到新鲜的感受。新年里，三五好友围绕着小茶几喝茶聊天、打纸牌，那份节日的温暖自然流淌心底。小鞋柜点亮局部空间一般家庭，玄关的空间相对都很狭小，此时，镶上镜子的小鞋柜可以使空间显得敞亮，而且非常便于出门前整理衣冠，客人造访时也不显得局促。各种造型的镜面镶嵌在带有顶线的柜体中，显得大气、干净，适当加入一些白色的点缀还可以改变深木色的沉闷印象，为鞋柜增添一份舒适感。而镜子旁边设计的两排挂钩，不仅方便了使用，也使空间整洁而不凌乱。目前，人们一般在进门处摆放鞋柜，习惯于在此换鞋以卸外界之尘。市场上的鞋柜，有“屏风式”、“低柜式”、“转角式”等。选择时在色彩和造型上应与整个居室风格一致，如“屏风式”设计，鞋柜内的空间大，可分上下层，上部以储藏全家换季鞋子，以盒装存放，排列有序，下部可分几层，如上层是进家后所换拖鞋，下层为日常换鞋之用，使用时十分方便。“懒人”沙发带来假日享受如今，一种不注意“形象”的“懒人沙发”开始成为都市人家中的新宠。它让从办公室正襟危坐的白领们回家后能像一滩泥似的坐在上面，无拘无束甚至“得意忘形”。新年假期是一个休闲的好时机，一款“懒人沙发”让你的假期舒适而安逸。你可以当它是靠背椅、单人床、大沙发、肥座垫，只要你喜欢，随便折腾好了，这是一种感觉，完全放松的，带着些温软、简单和自由的呼吸，在新年的喧闹中，开启另一年的梦想。“懒人沙发”是指以耐磨抗拉布质或皮质为面料，以发泡聚苯乙烯小球填充的软家居，其设计理念是不断打破陈规，按科学的人体工程理论设计，满足“任何形体、任何地点、任何地表”的需要。同时采用可拆洗的外布料，尽可能维护简单舒适的生活方式。其魅力在于，只要它放在那里，你就忍不住想要去坐一坐，一旦你坐上去，就会被饱满的粒子热情拥抱，总之，它能在一刹那间最忠诚最完全地满足你的需要。“休闲椅”独享新年的乐趣椅子或许是家居产品中最富于变化的生力军之一，总是带给我们盛大的视觉体验。居室里的大部分家具，包括陈列柜、电视柜、沙发等不会轻易更换，时间长了难免缺乏新意，在新年的扮家计划里，多几把造型别致的休闲椅子，常常会神奇地成为目光的焦点。新年的美好时节里，独坐一把浪漫随性的休闲椅，安享唯美的生活情致，享受最惬意的居家生活。休闲椅在各个不同空间有不同的选择。客厅是公共区域，比较热闹，所以休闲椅一定要颜色跳跃醒目，风格独特，成为一大风景，同时也要让人坐起来舒适，与沙发搭配得当。卧室家具种类不多，在卧室中添置一把休闲椅是一个人调整心情的方法之一。卧室里的休闲椅要与卧室环境匹配，颜色和款式不要太过跳跃，以免“打扰”到安静的空间。书房的休闲椅则更要求功能性和舒适度的统一。		正向	"Small objects, big fun, practical furniture to decorate the new year life. The lunar new year is coming, and every family is busy preparing for the new year's home items. Many consumers will choose some small coffee tables, leisure chairs, small entrance cabinets, and other small furniture to decorate their homes before the year. These small furniture are practical and eye-catching, and are very suitable for use in the home during the new year. A small tea table adds a touch of warmth. In the New Year, there are bound to be long-awaited gatherings with relatives and friends. For a small gathering of two or three people, a small tea table for placing tea and snacks is very necessary. Light-colored wooden coffee tables or natural wooden coffee tables are very suitable for matching with the popular light-colored series of sofas today. Their shape is simple, but they are refined, with a gentle tone, no complicated functions, and match the simple and bright sofas to show the beauty of the room. These small tea tables can be moved flexibly according to the needs of use, adding more convenience and ease to life, providing convenience for changing the appearance of the living room, and family and friends will also get a fresh feeling in the New Year. During the New Year, friends gather around a small tea table to drink tea, chat, and play cards, and the warmth of the festival naturally flows to the heart. Small shoe cabinets can brighten up the local space. In general families, the space of the entrance is relatively small. At this time, shoe cabinets with mirrors can make the space appear more spacious, and it is also very convenient for dressing up before going out. It does not seem cramped when guests visit. Various shapes of mirrors are embedded in cabinets with top lines, which look grand and clean. Some white accents can also change the impression of the gloomy dark wood color and add a sense of comfort to the shoe cabinet. The two rows of hooks designed beside the mirror not only facilitate use but also keep the space tidy and uncluttered. Nowadays, people usually place shoe cabinets at the entrance and are accustomed to changing shoes here to remove the dust from the outside. There are shoe cabinets on the market, such as ""screen style"", ""low cabinet style"", and ""corner style"". When choosing, the color and shape should be consistent with the style of the entire room, such as the ""screen style"" design. The space in the shoe cabinet is large, which can be divided into upper and lower layers. The upper part can be used to store the family's seasonal shoes, stored in boxes, arranged in order, and the lower part can be divided into several layers, such as the upper layer is the slippers changed after entering the house, and the lower layer is for daily shoe changes. It is very convenient to use. The Lazy Sofa Brings Holiday Enjoyment Now, a ""lazy sofa"" that pays no attention to ""image"" has become a new favorite in the homes of urban families. It allows white-collar workers who sit upright in the office to sit like a lump of mud at home, unrestrained and even ""forgetting propriety in joy"". New Year's holiday is a good time for leisure, a ""laziness sofa"" makes your holiday comfortable and relaxed. You can treat it as a backrest chair, a single bed, a large sofa, or a fat cushion, as long as you like, do whatever you want. This is a feeling, completely relaxed, with some soft, simple, and free breathing, in the noisy New Year, to start the dream of another year. A ""laziness sofa"" refers to a soft home furniture with wear-resistant and anti-tear fabric or leather as the material, and with small balls of foamed polystyrene as the filling. Its design concept is to constantly break conventions and design according to the scientific theory of ergonomics, to meet the needs of ""any shape, any location, and any surface"". Use detachable outer fabric to maintain a simple and comfortable lifestyle as much as possible. Its charm lies in the fact that you can't help but sit on it as long as it is there, and once you sit on it, you will be embraced by the fullness of the particles with enthusiasm, in short, it can satisfy your needs in the most loyal and complete way in an instant. The leisure chair is the most versatile force in home products, always bringing us grand visual experiences. Most of the furniture in the living room, including cabinets, TV stands, and sofas, are not easily replaced, and after a long time, they may lack novelty. In the home decoration plan for the New Year, adding a few chairs with unique shapes can often become the focus of attention. During the beautiful season of the New Year, sitting alone on a romantic and casual lounge chair, enjoying the most beautiful life sentiment, and enjoying the most comfortable home life. Recliners have different choices in various spaces. The living room is a public area, which is more lively, so the leisure chair must be eye-catching and unique in style, becoming a scenic spot, and it should also be comfortable to sit on and match the sofa properly. There are not many kinds of bedroom furniture, and adding a lounge chair to the bedroom is one of the ways for a person to adjust their mood. The休闲 chair in the bedroom should match the bedroom environment. The color and style should not be too jumping to avoid ""disturbing"" the quiet space. The lounge chair in the study requires a balance between functionality and comfort."

国信证券：银行挑梁关注中游证券通1.市场判断：加速上涨后的调整6月份市场在银行等权重板块推动下存在加速上涨可能，进而则可能引发真正的一轮调整，建议从补涨思路选择板块与个股，从而兼顾到策略性防御。2.行业配置：银行挑梁，关注中游本月最看好的三个行业依次为金融(银行、券商、保险)、钢铁、石油化工；前瞻性的看好钢铁、电解铝、化工、航运、造纸等中游行业中受益经济复苏、景气回升的行业。主要理由与逻辑：(1)息差拐点、估值洼地、流动性再泛滥、欧美经济与股市回升等利多因素将支撑金融尤其是银行板块上涨，进而推动指数繁荣。(2)前瞻性看好钢铁、电解铝、化工、航运、造纸等中游行业景气回升。因为这是实体经济真正复苏的重要判据。汽车地产两大先导性产业的复苏拉动经济走出谷底，2季度工业生产将持续回升，市场对于经济复苏的信心增强最终会引发资金增配钢铁等中游板块。(3)看好油价，谨慎对待煤炭、有色。欧美经济复苏态势基本确立，避险需求降低下的美元汇率走低推高商品市场，加上季节性因素，油价在3季度可相对乐观，有望推动化工等中游行业的产品价格。虽然我们对煤炭仍然看好，但在基金普遍超配和经历大幅上涨之后，新的机会需要等待到4季度，我们看好的大同煤业、平煤股份、盘江股份、中油化建则需要视资产注入事件的时点。有色板块业绩支撑较弱，不具备安全边际，建议逢高减持。(4)市场风格转换本质上是补涨行为，这也是提高投资组合防御性的一个重要因素，我们认为补涨的主要板块将集中在中游行业(钢铁、电解铝、化工、造纸、交通运输等)、消费品领域(食品饮料、商业)。3.个股选择策略与重点推荐组合自上而下，以及结合国信行业分析师自下而上的推荐，我们建议的6月份重点推荐组合为：建设银行、工商银行、招商银行、中国平安、辽宁成大、酒钢宏兴、鞍钢股份、中国联通、青岛海尔、华泰股份、辰州矿业、鑫科材料、云南城投、中天城投、山西三维、柳化股份、福耀玻璃、国阳新能、中国远洋、五粮液。		正向	Guosen Securities: Banks Lead the Way to Pay Attention to the Middle and Upstream Securities Communication 1. Market Judgment: Adjustment after Accelerated Rise The market may accelerate in June under the impetus of banks and other weighty sectors, which may then trigger a real round of adjustment. It is recommended to choose sectors and stocks from the perspective of catch-up, thus taking into account strategic defense. 2. Industry allocation: banks lead, focus on midstream industries, the top three industries we are most optimistic about this month are finance (banks, securities, insurance), steel, and petrochemicals; we have a forward-looking view on midstream industries such as steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemicals, shipping, and papermaking, which benefit from economic recovery and rising prosperity. Main reasons and logic: (1) The turning point of the spread, the undervaluation of valuation, the re-flood of liquidity, and the recovery of the US and European economies and stock markets will support the rise of finance, especially the banking sector, which will in turn promote the prosperity of the index. (2) Looking forward, we are optimistic about the recovery of the business cycle in the middle industries such as steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemical industry, shipping, and papermaking. Because this is an important criterion for a genuine recovery of the real economy. The recovery of the two leading industries of automotive and real estate will pull the economy out of the trough, and industrial production will continue to rise in the second quarter, which will eventually lead to an increase in fund allocation to midstream sectors such as steel as market confidence in economic recovery strengthens. (3) Keep an eye on oil prices and be cautious about coal and non-ferrous metals. The economic recovery of the European and American economies has basically been established, and the dollar exchange rate has fallen due to reduced demand for risk, which has pushed up the commodity market. In addition, with seasonal factors, oil prices can be relatively optimistic in the third quarter, which may push up the product prices of industries such as petrochemicals. Although we are still bullish on coal, new opportunities will have to wait until the fourth quarter after the general over-allocations and significant price increases in the fund. Datong Coal Industry, Pingmei Corporation, Panjiang Corporation, and China Oil Chemical Construction need to wait for the timing of the asset injection event. 有色板块 earnings support is weak and does not have a safety margin, and it is recommended to reduce positions at high levels. (4) Market style switching is essentially a catch-up behavior, which is also an important factor in improving the defensive nature of the investment portfolio. We believe that the main sectors of catch-up will be in the midstream industries (steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemicals, papermaking, transportation, etc.) and consumer goods sectors (food and beverage, commerce, etc). 3. Individual stock selection strategy and key recommendation portfolio from top to bottom, and combined with the recommendation of Guoxin industry analysts from bottom to top, we suggest the key recommendation portfolio for June as follows: China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, China平安, Liaoning Chengda, Gaoxin Hongxing, Angang Steel, China Unicom, Qingdao Haier, Huatai Paper, Chenzhou Mining, Xinko Materials, Yunnan City Investment, Zhongtian City Investment, Shanxi Three Dimensions, Liuhua Corporation, Fuyao Glass, Guoyang New Energy, China COSCO Shipping, Wuliangye.

欧元区救援基金主管：欧元不会崩溃新浪财经讯北京时间11月25日晚间消息，欧元区救援基金主管克劳斯-雷格林(KlausRegling)表示，即便葡萄牙等其他国家步希腊和爱尔兰的后尘、要求救援，也不存在债务危机导致欧元崩溃的可能性。雷格林周四在一份德国报纸上发表了上述评论，称尽管欧元可能出现贬值，外围弱国所遭遇的困境不会危及欧元区16国所共同使用的货币。他说：“完全不存在这种危险。没有任何国家会自愿放弃欧元，对于弱国而言这么做无异于经济自杀，对于强国而言同样如此。”不过他表示同意德国总理安格拉-默克尔(AngelaMerkel)的看法，就欧元而言，欧洲的确“形势十分严峻”。法国和德国外长均作出信心表态，称他们的国家有能力向爱尔兰提供快速援助，就像今年早些时候对希腊那样。他们表示，爱尔兰最近的紧缩政策将有助于提升大家对欧元的信心。与此同时，他们发出警告，欧盟需要作出政策改进以预防其他国家陷入危机螺旋，同时建立危机发生后实施干预的机制。(诚之)	克劳斯-雷格林,雷格林,KlausRegling,安格拉-默克尔,默克尔,诚之	正向	"Eurozone rescue fund boss: the euro will not collapse. Caixin.com, Nov 25, 2019 - Klaus Regling, the head of the eurozone rescue fund, said that even if other countries such as Portugal follow the footsteps of Greece and Ireland and request rescue, there is no possibility that the debt crisis will cause the euro to collapse. Reugling made the above comments in a German newspaper on Thursday, saying that even if the euro were to weaken, the difficulties faced by the peripheral weak countries would not endanger the currency used by the 16 countries in the euro zone. He said, ""There is no such danger at all.""  No country would voluntarily give up the euro, and it would be economic suicide for both weaker and stronger countries. But he agreed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that the situation for the euro was indeed “very serious” for Europe. Both the French and German foreign ministers made reassuring statements, saying that their countries were able to provide rapid assistance to Ireland, as they did for Greece earlier this year. They said that Ireland's recent austerity measures would help boost confidence in the euro. At the same time, they warn that the EU needs to make policy improvements to prevent other countries from falling into a crisis spiral, and to establish mechanisms for intervention after a crisis occurs.

瑞星发布Q3网络钓鱼报告：网民损失超50亿元10月12日，瑞星发布《2010年第三季度网络钓鱼报告》，报告指出，现在每天出现1万余个新钓鱼网站，其中95%是由机器自动生成，传统反钓鱼技术很难识别。除了传统意义上的钓鱼网站之外，网络诈骗与客户端软件结合、甚至与传统电话诈骗结合，成为新型诈骗的显著特点，比如刷钻、刷信用等已经成为黑客赚钱常用的手法。瑞星安全专家指出，由于第三季度包括了暑假出游高峰及中秋假期，网民们通过网络订票、网络购物、上网游戏的交易量相对上升，所以造成其因钓鱼诈骗遭受的损失以及间接损失，比去年同期大幅上升，据估算可能高达50至70亿元。瑞星报告中也列举了一些案例，包括“QQ刷钻”、“淘宝刷信用”等新型钓鱼诈骗开始肆虐。但这些网站通常会直接骗取用户的手机话费和账户里的钱，因此危害性极大。而且这些活动本身就属于不合法的灰色地带，即使网民被骗，也往往会因为“干这个本来就不对”而忍气吞声。8月下旬，瑞星“云安全”系统的反钓鱼功能正式上线，并为“瑞星全功能安全软件2011测试版”提供智能反钓鱼的云端支持。自启用至今，共截获47万多个钓鱼网站(以URL计算)，比未启用前的拦截数量提高数十倍。从最新截获的钓鱼网站数据来看，约有20%的钓鱼网站寿命仅有一天，80%的钓鱼网站存活不超过一个星期。这就使得采用传统方式拦截钓鱼网站效果有限，有超过70%的钓鱼网站成为漏网之鱼。瑞星安全专家表示，即将推出的瑞星2011新版软件，将采用智能化的方式，根据钓鱼网站的颜色、布局、行为特征等进行判断，拦截有效率达90%以上。无论钓鱼网站怎么变化域名、怎么更改自己的特征，都逃不出瑞星的“慧眼”。“中奖骗局”等占钓鱼网站九成根据《瑞星报告》数据显示，本季度共截获55万个钓鱼网站(8月之前以传统方式截获8万余个)，且呈不断加速的趋势。其中，以“假中奖”及“假购物网站”等方式出现的钓鱼网站居多，占据总体数量的90%以上，而在涉及到具体事件时，某一类“李鬼”网站则会出现相应的“井喷”。比如，在新浪“微博一周年”活动期间冒出的大量“抽奖网站”，或者在暑运临近到来时，涌现的各种逼真的“航空公司官网”，这一类钓鱼网站制作精良，如果不仔细甄别地址，单从页面信息上很难分辨真伪。瑞星安全专家对每月新增的典型网站进行追踪监测发现，虽然钓鱼网站的数量及形式在不断增加，但网站的平均生存周期及点击次数却在逐步降低。目前，80%以上钓鱼网站存活不会超过一个星期，有的甚至只存活短短几个小时。这说明，随着“钓鱼手法”的持续曝光，人们的安全意识在不断提升，也促使钓鱼网站“与时俱进”地变换欺骗方式，以更加具有迷惑性的面貌出现。QQ刷钻是如何骗钱的著名的聊天软件QQ有多种会员级别，需要充值才可获得，有时候使用一定的技巧，可以在较短时间内升级为高级会员，享受更大的存储空间、QQ聊天记录在线存储等多种贴心服务。黑客利用网民急于升级为高级会员的心理，号称通过使用某种软件，可以利用腾讯系统的漏洞，在较短时间内少花钱甚至不花钱升级为高等级会员。在百度上搜索“QQ刷钻”，可以找到70万条结果，根据瑞星公司的监测，在搜索结果的第一页显著位置，就有所谓“QQ刷钻外挂”下载，这些软件有两种骗钱手法：第一种，直接在软件里捆绑木马，强制修改IE首页、弹出广告等，获取利益。这种手法在用户使用后很容易识破，现在不大常见。第二种手法则比较高明，用户运行“刷钻外挂”后，软件会提示“填入手机号即可升级到黄钻”等。实际上当你填入手机号后，会要求“开通某某套餐”，软件界面会狡辩说“套餐只是为了验证手机号真伪，不收取费用”，其实会收取名目繁多的各类套餐费用。		正向	"Rising Star released the Q3 network phishing report: Internet users lost more than 5 billion yuan. On October 12, Rising Star released the 2010 Q3 Network Phishing Report, which pointed out that more than 10,000 new phishing websites appeared every day, of which 95% were automatically generated by machines, and traditional anti-phishing technology was difficult to identify. In addition to traditional phishing websites, online fraud has combined with client software and even traditional telephone fraud, becoming a prominent feature of new types of fraud, such as brushing points and brushing credit, which have become common methods for hackers to make money. Rising transaction volumes of online ticket booking, online shopping, and online gaming during the summer vacation and Mid-Autumn Festival in the third quarter have led to a significant increase in losses from phishing scams and indirect losses, according to security experts from Risen. The estimated losses may be as high as 5 to 7 billion yuan. Rising reports also listed some cases, including the new types of phishing fraud such as “QQ brushing diamonds” and “Taobao brushing credit”. But these websites usually directly defraud users' mobile phone bills and money in their accounts, so they are extremely harmful. And these activities themselves are in a gray area of illegality, and even if netizens are defrauded, they often remain silent because of the belief that “this is wrong anyway.” In late August, Risheng's ""cloud security"" system launched its anti-phishing function, and provided intelligent cloud support for the 2011 test version of ""Risheng's full-featured security software."" Since its launch, more than 470,000 phishing websites (calculated by URL) have been intercepted, which is dozens of times more than the number of interceptions before it was launched. Based on the latest data from the intercepted phishing websites, about 20% of the phishing websites only last for one day, and 80% of the phishing websites do not survive for more than a week. This makes traditional interception of phishing websites ineffective, with more than 70% of phishing websites slipping through the net. Rising security experts said that the new version of Rising 2011 software to be launched will adopt an intelligent way to judge according to the color, layout, behavior characteristics of the phishing website, and the interception effectiveness rate will be more than 90%. No matter how phishing websites change their domain names or modify their own features, they cannot escape the ""wisdom eye"" of Rising Star. Lottery scams account for 90% of all phishing sites, according to the data in the Risen Report, which shows that 550,000 phishing sites were intercepted in this quarter (80,000 were intercepted in the traditional way before August), and the trend is accelerating. Among them, phishing websites that appear in the form of ""fake lottery"" and ""fake shopping websites"" account for more than 90% of the total, and in specific events, a certain type of ""Li Gui"" website will have a corresponding ""outburst"". For example, a large number of ""lottery websites"" that emerged during the ""Sina Weibo One-Year Anniversary"" event, or the various realistic ""airline websites"" that emerged as the summer vacation approached. This kind of phishing website is well-made, and it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity from the page information alone without carefully distinguishing the address. RS security experts have tracked and monitored the typical websites added each month, and found that although the number and form of phishing websites are increasing, the average survival period and click times of the websites are gradually decreasing. Currently, more than 80% of phishing websites will not survive for more than a week, and some even survive for just a few hours. This indicates that as the ""fishing technique"" continues to be exposed, people's security awareness is constantly improving, which also promotes the ""fishing websites"" to change their deceptive methods in a timely manner, and appear in a more deceptive form. How does QQ Diamond Scam to make money? QQ, a famous chat software, has various membership levels that require recharging to obtain. Sometimes, by using certain techniques, you can upgrade to a higher membership level in a short time, enjoying larger storage space, online storage of QQ chat records, and other thoughtful services. Hackers exploit the eagerness of netizens to upgrade to a premium member by claiming that by using a certain software, they can take advantage of vulnerabilities in the Tencent system to upgrade to a higher level member at a lower cost or even for free in a short period of time. A search for ""QQ brushing diamonds"" on Baidu can find 700,000 results. According to the monitoring of Risen Company, there is a ""QQ brushing diamonds cheat"" download on the prominent position of the first page of the search results. These software have two ways of cheating: the first is to bundle a Trojan in the software and force to modify the IE homepage and pop-up ads to get benefits. This trick is easy to spot after use, and is not commonly seen nowadays. The second approach is more sophisticated, as the software prompts the user to ""enter a phone number to upgrade to yellow diamonds,"" after running the ""drill brushing cheat."" Actually, after you fill in the mobile phone number, it will ask you to ""activate a certain package"", and the software interface will argue that ""the package is only for verifying the authenticity of the mobile phone number and does not charge any fees"", but in fact, it will charge various package fees."

I plan to work part-time to earn some tuition fees during the two months of summer vacation after the college entrance examination. Wei Lin could rank in the top five in her class in each senior high school mock exam, and in the top twenty to thirty among more than 800 senior high school students in the school. She most wishes to take the accounting major of Central University of Finance and Economics, but she does not want her grandparents to be at a loss for tuition fees every day, so she wants to apply for a scholarship.

比人更懂地球Sprint定制LG环保Remarq文/王彬人们每天都在呼吁环保，更准确的说，应该是科学家时刻都在努力唤醒人们的环保意识，但是又有多少人真的听得进去，并且从以身作则地有实际行动呢？如果被问到，你了解地球有多少？你是否真的了解低碳生活？如果一部手机可以计算人一天所产生的二氧化碳量，并且与植物排放入大气的比较，你是否会购买呢？如果答案是肯定的，这部Sprint定制的LG环保手机Remarq再合适不过了。除能够实现上述功能外，Remarq自身也是做到了彻头彻尾的环保。机身部分由可回收的塑料材质组成，整体可回收物料的利用率超过87%。甚至连机器的包装盒都是从废纸再利用做成，包装内没有纸质说明书，用户可在线查找相关资料。不过手机仍配备了滑盖式QWERTY键盘，并配有130万像素摄像头，以及QVGA屏幕。回到刚刚的问题，这样一部手机你会购买吗？为了环保，整机可以说是基本上都是回收废料再提炼而成，所以运营商也明智地将其定位在两年合约零消费的水平。真心希望可以唤醒人们丧失多年的环保概念，手机将在5月9日正式发布。	王彬	正向	More Earth-Savvy Than Humans: Sprint Customizes LG’s Remarq. By Wang Bin. People are always calling for environmental protection, more accurately, scientists are always trying to awaken people’s environmental awareness, but how many people really listen and take action in their own way? If asked, how much do you know about the earth? Do you really understand low-carbon life? If a mobile phone can calculate the amount of carbon dioxide produced by a person in a day and compare it with the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by plants, would you buy it? If the answer is yes, the Sprint customized LG eco-friendly phone Remarq is just right. In addition to achieving the above functions, Remarq itself is thoroughly environmentally friendly. The body part is made of recyclable plastic material, and the utilization rate of recyclable materials exceeds 87%. Even the machine's packaging box is made from recycled paper, and there is no paper manual in the packaging, users can find relevant materials online. But the phone still has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, a 1.3-megapixel camera, and a QVGA screen. Back to the original question, would you buy such a mobile phone? For environmental protection, the entire machine can basically be refined from recycled waste, so the operator has wisely positioned it at the level of zero consumption for two-year contracts. I sincerely hope that we can awaken the environmental protection concept that people have lost for many years, and the mobile phone will be officially released on May 9.
个性选手屡遭淘汰红歌会被质疑缺乏原创(图)新浪娱乐讯业内唯一一个国字头的选秀节目中国红歌会眼下已经结束了全国晋级赛第一部分的比拼，胜出的全国12强选手目前正在南昌进行周日(8月2日)红歌英雄汇第一场的准备。然而，眼下这个以重温经典为主的歌会却因淘汰个性选手而遭到缺乏原创性的质疑。个性选手纷纷败北经过了三年的举办，今年在这个被认为受中老年观众追捧的节目中出现了更多八零后九零后选手。在他们中，有主修声乐的科班生，也有不少走所谓“民族通俗”路线的酒吧歌手。尽管老评委们一再称自己很高兴看到年轻人唱红歌，然而这些给被观众称为“有想法”的歌手经过了几轮的淘汰之后却纷纷离开舞台。将《飞得更高》、《奔跑》等作品中融入新元素的叮当组合在第一轮比赛中就惨遭淘汰，而改编经典《小河淌水》为灵魂乐版本的梁凡在突围战第二场也败下阵来。老歌新唱遭反对红歌会被质疑缺乏原创流行红歌手纷纷败北遭到了不少年轻观众的不满，这些新红歌演唱者实力不俗又有想法，被淘汰实在不应该，可这些受年轻观众追捧的个性选手在老评委处却没有得到太高的评价。叮当组合等选手在海选时就曾被评委指出随意改编老歌是对原作者的不敬，梁凡在彩排时还曾被工作人员要求换歌。就此，评委蒋大为在沈阳赛区接受采访时曾表示，新红歌不是改编老的作品，而是写出真正反映这个时代的原创作品。事实上，认为红歌需要原创的不止评委蒋大为一人，最近就有业界人士指出红歌会鼓励选手演唱经典，没有原创作品产生，节目本身不具市场化。不过也有人认为，喜欢红歌的人大多是些思想正统生活态度积极的观众，重温经典的理念刚好迎合了他们的口味。据红歌会栏目组一位工作人员称，周日在江西电视台进行的红歌英雄会第一场中，大部分歌手还是会选择演唱经典老歌，但也不排除个别选手演唱原创作品的可能性。(大拇指)	叮当,梁凡,蒋大为	负向	"Individual contestants are eliminated, red songs are questioned for lack of originality (picture) Sina Entertainment News [Industry] The only national-level talent show in China, China Red Song Meeting, has now ended the first part of the national advancement competition. The 12 national winners are currently in Nanchang preparing for the first Red Song Hero Gathering on Sunday (August 2). However, this concert, which is mainly about reviving classics, has been questioned for its lack of originality due to the elimination of individual contestants. The individual players with unique personalities have all lost. After three years of hosting, this year's program, which is believed to be favored by middle-aged and elderly viewers, has seen more contestants in their eighties and nineties. Among them, there are students of vocal music, as well as quite a few bar singers who follow the so-called ""national popular"" route. Although the old judges repeatedly said that they were happy to see young people singing red songs, the singers who were called ""having ideas"" by the audience were eliminated and left the stage one after another. Dingdang, who incorporated new elements into works such as ""Fly Higher"" and ""Run,"" was eliminated in the first round, while Liang Fan, who adapted the classic ""Water Flows in the Creek"" into a soul version, also failed to advance in the second elimination round. Old songs performed in a new style were opposed, and red songs were questioned for lacking originality. Many young viewers were dissatisfied with the fact that these new red singers, who were not only talented but also had ideas, were eliminated. However, these individual contestants, who were favored by young viewers, did not receive high evaluations from the old judges. The Dingdang group and other contestants were told by the judges that it was disrespectful to the original authors to casually adapt old songs during the preliminary rounds, and Liang Fan was even asked to change the song during rehearsals. In an interview with the media in Shenyang, judge Jiang Dawei said that the new red songs are not adaptations of old works, but original works that truly reflect the times. In fact, it is not just judge Jiang Dawei who believes that red songs need to be original. Recently, an industry insider pointed out that the Red Song Competition encourages contestants to sing classics, and no original works are produced. The program itself is not marketable. But some people also believe that those who like red songs are mostly audience with orthodox thoughts and positive life attitudes, and the idea of re-reading classics just suits their taste. According to a staff member of the Red Song Column, most of the singers will choose to sing classic old songs in the first Red Song Hero competition held on Jiangxi TV on Sunday, but it is not excluded that some contestants will perform their original works.

李天一打人未满18周岁尚不具备承担刑责条件本报记者叶涵在这起事件中，李双江(微博)之子李天一未满18周岁，但涉嫌寻衅滋事和故意伤害，且因没有取得驾照还涉嫌无照驾驶。而李双江梦鸽夫妇作为李天一的监护人，在这起事件中又需承担怎样的法律责任呢？网上就此议论纷纷，各种说法都有，昨天记者请教了浙联律师事务所主任戴和平律师。北京海淀警方昨日发给媒体的声明称，苏某、李某因涉嫌寻衅滋事罪已被海淀公安分局依法拘留，目前正在进一步审理中。戴和平律师介绍，寻衅滋事罪，是指在公共场所无事生非，起哄闹事，殴打伤害无辜，肆意挑衅，横行霸道，破坏公共秩序的行为。如被证实，可处5年以下有期徒刑、拘役或者管制。如是14周岁以上却未满18周岁的未成年人，则可以从轻或减轻处罚。但《刑法》同时规定，已满14周岁不满16周岁的人，只对犯故意杀人、故意伤害致人重伤或者死亡、强奸、抢劫、贩卖毒品、放火、爆炸、投毒罪的，负刑事责任，其他的不构成刑事责任。根据现有资料，李天一出生于1996年4月，到今年的9月刚好是15周岁多5个月，不满16周岁，因此假如其出生年月无误，则不用承担刑事责任。李双江夫妇可能被追究民事责任戴律师表示，在此案中，受害者可以向李天一的监护人即李双江及梦鸽追究民事责任，伤者可索取民事赔偿，包括医药费、误工费、营养费及精神损失费等。此外，李天一肇事时无证驾驶宝马车也成为焦点。一位知情者称，车先前是李双江妻子梦鸽的，是一辆白色宝马。今年5月份，他曾陪同李双江之子在“宝马亿佰欧改装俱乐部”进行改装，变成了以黑色为主体，橘色镶边的改装豪车，改装费用约27万元。根据法律规定，改变车身颜色、更换发动机、车身或者车架，未在变更后10日内向车辆管理所申请变更登记的，由公安机关交通管理部门处警告或者200元以下罚款；擅自改变机动车外形和已登记的有关技术数据的，由公安机关交通管理部门责令恢复原状，并处警告或者500元以下罚款。由于未成年人不得考取驾照，李天一属于无照驾驶，根据规定可由公安交通管理部门处200元以上2000元以下的罚款，可以并处15日以下拘留。	李天一,叶涵,李双江,梦鸽,戴和平,苏某,李某	正向	"Li Tianyi beat someone and was not 18 years old and did not meet the conditions for criminal responsibility. The reporter Ye Han. In this incident, Li Tianyi, the son of Li Shuangjiang (Weibo), was not 18 years old, but was suspected of provoking trouble and intentional injury, and was also suspected of driving without a license because he had not obtained a driver's license. And as监护 people of Li Tianyi, what legal responsibility should Li Shuangjiang and Meng Guo bear in this incident? There are all kinds of speculations online, and yesterday, I consulted with Dai Pingheng, a lawyer from Zhelian Law Firm. Beijing Haidian police issued a statement to the media yesterday that Su and Li have been lawfully detained by Haidian Public Security Bureau on suspicion of disturbing public order, and are currently under further investigation. Attorney Dai Pingheng introduced that the crime of provoking trouble refers to the behavior of making trouble and stirring up trouble in public places, beating and injuring innocent people, provoking trouble without reason, bullying and tyrannizing, and destroying public order. If proven, it may be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, criminal detention, or public surveillance. If they are minors aged over 14 but under 18, they may be punished less severely. But the Criminal Law also stipulates that persons who are over 14 but under 16 years of age shall bear criminal responsibility only for intentional homicide, intentional injury resulting in serious bodily injury or death, rape, robbery, drug trafficking, arson, explosion, and投放毒物. According to the existing materials, Li Tianyi was born in April 1996, and by September of this year, he would be 15 years and 5 months old, which is not yet 16 years old. Therefore, if his date of birth is correct, he does not need to bear criminal responsibility. Li Shuangjiang and his wife may be held civilly liable. Dai, the lawyer, said that in this case, the victim can hold Li Tianyi’s guardian, Li Shuangjiang and Meng Guo, civilly liable, and the injured can claim civil compensation, including medical expenses, loss of work, nutritional expenses, and mental damage, etc. In addition, Li Tianyi’s driving without a license when he caused the accident also became a focus. A source said that the car was previously owned by Li Shuangjiang's wife Meng Guoqiang, a white BMW. In May this year, he accompanied Li Shuangjiang's son to the ""BMW Yi Biouo Modification Club"" for modification, which turned into a luxury modified car with black as the main color and orange trim, with a modification cost of about 270,000 yuan. According to the law, if the vehicle color, engine, body or chassis is changed and the change is not applied for within 10 days to the vehicle management office, the public security traffic management department shall impose a warning or a fine of less than 200 yuan; if the appearance and technical data registered on the motor vehicle are changed without authorization, the public security traffic management department shall order the restoration to the original condition and impose a warning or a fine of less than 500 yuan. Since minors are not allowed to take a driving license, Li Tianyi is considered to be driving without a license. According to the regulations, the public security traffic management department may impose a fine of more than 200 yuan and up to 2000 yuan, and may also impose detention for up to 15 days."

Within just two hours, the microblog was forwarded more than 50,000 times. Tian Liang posted a microblog to inform netizens that his grandmother had been found, and thanked the netizens who forwarded the missing person microblog. At 11:40 on July 5, 2011, Tian Liang in Beijing posted a rescue message on his Sina Weibo: ""My grandmother is seriously lost her memory due to her old age. She went out for a walk after dinner last night and went missing in her hometown of Chongqing.

美联储维持0-0.25%基准利率区间不变新浪财经讯北京时间1月28日凌晨3点15分，美联储在结束为期两天的利率会议后宣布，维持0-0.25%的基准利率区间不变。此举符合市场的普遍预期。联邦公开市场委员会(FOMC)在会后发表的政策声明指出，预计将在较长时间内维持超低利率政策，将在三月底终止采购抵押贷款支持证券项目。此外，与上一份声明相比，联储对经济前景的判断略微乐观一些。联储还称，将在三月结束针对银行的信贷拍卖项目。一些分析师评论道，在为期两天的闭门会议中，联储官员在利率和经济前景方面上有许多问题要谈论，但他们在公开场合不会发表太多言论。联储前董事劳伦斯-迈耶(LaurenceMeyer)称：“从联储将采取何种行动的角度看，这可能是一次平淡无奇的会议，但从其他角度看它又特别令人感兴趣。”巴克莱资本的经济学家迪安-马基(DeanMaki)表示，联储主席伯南克第二任期提名引发的争议只会让联储变得更低调。本周四参院将就是否批准伯南克连任进行表决。市场分析师普遍预期奥巴马总统对伯南克再任联储主席的提名将获得通过。另一个令人感兴趣的问题是美国经济的前景。联储官员早已表示，他们并不认为失业率在短期内会有太大改善。多数经济学家认为，在劳动力市场出现明显的改善迹象之后联储才可能启动紧缩政策。因此，分析人士普遍预期FOMC在会后声明中将再度强调联邦基金利率有必要在相当长一段时间内维持在历史超低水平。多数联储观察家认为，今天联储将重申多数特别流动性工具将于2月1日终止，此外联储可能声明采购1.25万亿美元抵押贷款支持证券的计划将按原计划于3月底结束。联储观察家还表示，在声明无重大变化的表象之下可能掩藏着联储官员对退出策略的激烈争论。FOMC在12月上一次会议的声明中曾指出，将在“未来的会议上讨论在较长期内推行货币政策的替代性措施”。观察家认为，这无异于公开了一个秘密：现在联储官员还不清楚最优的退出方案是什么。	劳伦斯-迈耶,迈耶,迪安-马基,马基,伯南克,奥巴马	正向	"The Federal Reserve maintained the 0-0.25% benchmark interest rate range. Sina Finance News, on January 28, 2021, at 3:15 am, after the two-day interest rate meeting, the Federal Reserve announced that it would maintain the 0-0.25% benchmark interest rate range unchanged. This is in line with the general market expectation. The policy statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after the meeting noted that it expected to maintain ultra-low interest rate policy for a considerable period of time and to end the purchase of mortgage-backed securities by the end of March. Moreover, the Fed’s assessment of the economic outlook is slightly more optimistic than in its previous statement. The Fed also said it would end the credit auction program for banks in March. Some analysts commented that during the two-day closed-door meeting, Fed officials had a lot to talk about in terms of interest rates and economic outlook, but they would not make many public statements. Former Fed director Laurence Meyer said, ""From the perspective of what the Fed will do, this may be a boring meeting, but from other perspectives, it is particularly interesting."" Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital, said that the controversy over Bernanke’s nomination for a second term at the Fed will only make the Fed more low-key. The Senate will vote this Thursday on whether to approve Bernanke's reappointment. Market analysts generally expect that President Obama's nomination of Bernanke for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve will be approved. Another interesting question is the prospect of the US economy. Fed officials have long indicated that they do not expect the unemployment rate to improve much in the short term. Most economists believe that the Fed will not start tightening policy until there are clear signs of improvement in the labor market. Thus, analysts generally expect the FOMC to reiterate in its post-meeting statement that the federal funds rate needs to remain at historically ultra-low levels for an extended period of time. Most Fed watchers expect the central bank to reiterate today that most special liquidity facilities will end on February 1, and that the Fed may also announce that its plan to purchase $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities will end as scheduled in March. The Fed watchers also noted that there may be a fierce debate among Fed officials about the exit strategy, masked by the appearance of no major changes in the statement. The FOMC’s statement from its December meeting noted that it would “discuss alternative approaches to longer-term monetary policy implementation at future meetings.” Observers view this as tantamount to revealing a secret: Fed officials still do not know what the optimal exit strategy is."

The two parties will cooperate in the field of news, advertising, radio and television, and provide academic education services for more people engaged in media work or those who are interested in the media direction. It is reported that the cooperation between Openg and China Media University had entered the discussion stage as early as the beginning of 2009. Ma Qian, deputy director of the Open Platform for Distance Education Center, introduced that ""The strength of China Media University in the field of media is beyond doubt. We are very precious about this cooperation. We spent more than a year discussing and planning the cooperation model, cooperation scope and future development direction, etc. This is inseparable from the uniqueness of China Media University in network education."" Previously, China University of Political Science and Law has always relied on the radio and television system to carry out network education, and has independently developed a teaching management platform and built a complete course resource system. These accumulated teaching and management experiences are very precious. After the signing ceremony, Wu Yanxiong, the president of the Distance and Continuing Education College of China University of Culture and Communication, revealed the deep reasons for the cooperation between the two sides. He said, ""In recent years, the Chinese media industry has developed rapidly, and the realization of social recruitment is the requirement of the development of the whole industry."" And Open Education's keen market perception, teaching support service capability, and comprehensive social service capability, and so on, are exactly what we need for our media industry education and talent cultivation work. Therefore, after multiple on-site visits, we finally chose to cooperate with AoPeng Education. Such cooperation will be a win-win cooperation. And 'cultivating elites in the field of media' is our common goal for this cooperation! According to industry experts, the formal signing of the cooperation agreement between the two parties will further expand the student population covered by AoPeng Education, and also has great significance for the expansion of its on-the-job training and academic education models. Meanwhile, CUPT has taken a big step towards providing comprehensive socialized teaching services for network education. As we know, since its establishment in 2001, Ao Peng Education has cooperated with more than 43 key domestic universities including Peking University, Zhejiang University and China Media University, and more than 500,000 students, and teachers from more than 1,400 learning centers provide 24-hour full-time academic counseling services for students. In 2009, Open Education created a ""compatible"" model for online academic education and vocational education. Students can obtain relevant vocational qualification certificates at the same time as they receive their graduation certificates, which to some extent promotes the improvement of professional talent quality."
据称深圳反腐行动可能牵涉一大批开发商2005年至2009年，深圳房价暴涨的四年里，有几位民营地产商人格外引人注目，其中三人是星河地产集团董事长黄楚龙、卓越地产集团董事长李华、京基地产公司董事长陈华。他们可以以协议出让等非常规手段在深圳市中心地段拿地，在深圳房价暴涨过程中受益颇多，因此身处深圳地产的风暴眼中。中心区拿地高手黄楚龙本报记者张睿发自深圳深圳房地产界的大腕儿中，不得不提星河地产的董事长黄楚龙。这位习惯别人称他为“龙哥”，总自称“潮州佬”的地产商人，从1979年到深圳做工程创业至今，已经成为深圳中心城区数一数二的“大哥”。坊间传言，黄楚龙眼下已离开了深圳。时代周报记者多次寻访黄楚龙，6月12日上午，在星河地产公司，只见其办公室门开着，门口留有一双拖鞋。记者立即拨打其手机，但直至截稿时，黄楚龙的电话一直都被转至语音信箱，黄楚龙杳无音信。过江猛龙黄楚龙星河地产在深圳赫赫有名。深圳的出租车司机，说起星河的项目都如数家珍。“星河的房子都卖得很好，因为地段特别好。”21世纪不动产(21世纪不动产博客)的一位经纪人告诉时代周报记者，“黄老板实力很强，总能在中心城区拿到好地。”深圳地铁一号线CBD核心区的三个地铁站周边，聚集了星河地产开发的四个项目。同许多地产商的发展历程相似，黄楚龙也是从建筑工人起家的。1979年，他在深圳建特区伊始就前来创业，“泥水匠”的活儿做得风生水起，后来慢慢开始做起包工头，承接了深圳第一大道深南大道(上海宾馆至上步路)的建设工程。靠着做包工头淘得的第一桶金，1998年，黄楚龙成立了深圳怡和企业公司，即星河地产的前身。黄楚龙摇身一变，成为一个开发商。1994年4月，黄楚龙成立深圳市新怡和实业发展有限公司，先后开发了祥和花园、怡和楼、海悦华城等多个项目。1999年12月，新怡和更名为深圳市星河房地产开发有限公司。深圳著名房地产评论员“图腾镜”，在其博客上记录了万科集团董事长王石(王石博客)、星河地产董事长黄楚龙和世联地产(世联地产博客)顾问股份有限公司董事长陈劲松在一次饭桌上的“论道”。席间，陈劲松感叹，深圳民营房地产企业都没能走出去时，黄楚龙马上产生共鸣：“不错，我也走过很多城市。深有感触的是：人生地不熟，水土又不服。中午喝5斤白酒，晚上还要喝6斤，再喝下去，命都要陪进去了，故而不得不撤。”就是这位在其他城市“人生地不熟”的商人，却将其在深圳的地产事业经营得如鱼得水。“在深圳，万科、招商等上市公司往往拿不到中心区的地块，中心区的地块都被几个深圳的民营房企垄断了。”深圳某大型房地产企业的负责人向时代周报记者透露。黄楚龙的星河，就是这几家“中心区垄断大户”之一。2002年，位于福华三路和滨河大道之间的星河国际顺利开售，让黄楚龙真正在深圳中心区站稳了脚跟。到2005年，星河地产的项目全面开花。并赶上了2005-2007年，深圳房价飞涨的好时候。根据深圳地产咨询机构香地#zhPoint#半求工作室的统计分析，在深圳的CBD,每100平方米商品建筑中，就有12平方米是星河地产供应的。“官司门”抖落前生事同其他地产商相比，星河的土地储备不算多，却贵在“稀缺”。在藏龙卧虎的深圳地产界，这条过江猛龙能够击败众多对手，选地的眼光和拿地的能力自然不言而喻。2003年2月，黄楚龙在深圳首次进行的土地拍卖会上，以1.8亿元的总价、免息8年分期付款的方式，将如今的星河发展中心和丽思#zhPoint#卡尔顿项目一举拿下。2003年12月23日，黄楚龙又突然将目光放到关外，以2.5亿元的价格拍下龙岗区一幅17万平方米的地块。如今，地块所在的龙岗中心城，正在以规划中龙岗政治、经济、文化中心的身份大兴土木。黄楚龙拿地的能力不止于雄厚的资金实力。时代周报记者查阅深圳国土房管局的资料发现，黄楚龙在中心区大获成功的星河国际和星河世纪两个项目，权属来源均为“协议出让”。其中，星河国际项目的取得时间是1999年。而星河世纪大厦的受让日期是2004年9月13日，权属来源也是协议出让。2004年8月31日土地大限后，所有经营性用地都要通过招、拍、挂方式转让，星河是如何以协议出让的方式获得星河世纪大厦项目的用地呢？就在时代周报记者多方查证之时，6月16日，一宗以星河世纪大厦为标的物的案件，在福田区人民法院公开审理。黄楚龙获得星河世纪项目的相关情节，在这个案件中若隐若现。时代周报记者悉，星河世纪地块原属深圳市“还地于民”政策涉及的地块之一，使用权属于岗厦实业股份有限公司。2000年3月，由东永峰公司牵线搭桥，深圳岗厦与锦峰公司和东永峰公司签署了一份合作开发的协议，由岗厦公司提供商住用地，东永峰公司和锦峰公司提供建设资金，联合开发该地块。建成后岗厦公司分得物业11000平方米，其余物业归东永峰公司和锦峰公司所有。但在开发建设过程中，却陡生变数。按照原告方锦峰公司86名员工和股东的说法，2004年1月13日，锦峰公司的法定代表人同东永峰公司和岗厦公司签订协议，退出了该地块的开发。2004年1月12日，东永峰公司将这个项目转给了星河地产。原告方认为，锦峰公司法定代表人未召开董事会和股东会，未听取工会和职工意见就退出该项目的开发，且仅仅收回前期投资成本，让一个原本可以盈利的项目在开发中途拱手让人，造成了锦峰员工和股东的经济损失；且认为在项目操作中，包括锦峰公司的大股东深圳市福田投资发展公司、东永峰公司、锦峰公司法定代表人等几名被告有恶意串通的行为，遂将其悉数告上法庭；而福田区人民政府，也被原告认为支持并促成其他被告的侵权行为而成为又一被告。案情线索复杂、扑朔迷离。至今深圳市国土房管局的资料仍然显示星河世纪项目开发企业是深圳东永峰实业有限公司，而星河地产如何介入、通过协议出让方式获得星河世纪项目的细节，还是一个谜。星河地产总经理刘世成对时代周报记者表示：“他对此事并不清楚。”黄楚龙的江湖情结深圳地产界的人士说起这位“龙哥”，总免不了豪爽、重义气、朋友多、人脉广这些评价。黄楚龙的江湖情结，也奠定了他在圈子内的地位。深圳市工商局公开资料显示，黄楚龙最早成立的怡和企业公司，就有深圳市福田区沙头街道办事处以主管单位的身份作股东。黄楚龙的豪气，不仅体现在做地产项目上，关于其子2007年豪华婚礼的描述和图片在网上流传甚广。黄楚龙的一位老乡还爆料，黄楚龙邀请了村里大约500人去酒店大吃一顿，并且还给每人封了400元的红包，被网友们称为“史上最牛婚礼”。熟悉黄楚龙的人都发现，他的手腕和脖颈上都挂着佛珠。有知情人士透露：“黄老板一方面是会赚钱的商人，另一方面是礼佛散财的信徒。”黄楚龙经营企业的理念也时常为业内津津乐道。时代周报记者探访星河地产在星河发展中心17-24层的新总部时，发现贴在不同楼层的黄氏语录—“你好、我好、大家好，才是真的好”；“先做人，后做事，外圆而内方”。我要评论	黄楚龙,李华,陈华,张睿,黄老板,王石,陈劲松,岗厦,东永峰,锦峰,方锦峰,刘世成,黄氏	正向	"It is alleged that the anti-corruption campaign in Shenzhen may involve a large number of developers. During the four years from 2005 to 2009, when Shenzhen’s housing prices soared, several private real estate businessmen stood out, among whom were Huang Chulong, chairman of the Shenghe Real Estate Group, Li Hua, chairman of the Zuyue Real Estate Group, and Chen Hua, chairman of the Jingdian Real Estate Company. They could acquire land in the central districts of Shenzhen through unconventional means such as agreement transfer, and benefited greatly from the rapid rise in Shenzhen’s housing prices, thus being at the center of the real estate storm in Shenzhen. Central district land acquisition expert Huang Chulong, reported by Zhang Rui, a reporter from Shenzhen. Among the big shots in the real estate industry in Shenzhen, Huang Chulong, the chairman of Star River Real Estate, cannot be ignored. This property businessman, who is used to being called ""Dragon Brother"" and always calls himself a ""Chaozhou native"", has become one of the top ""big brothers"" in the central urban area of Shenzhen since he started his business in Shenzhen in 1979. It is rumored that Huang Chulong has left Shenzhen. Times Weekly reporters visited Huang Chulong multiple times. On the morning of June 12, at the Star River real estate company, his office door was open, and a pair of slippers was left at the door. The reporter immediately called his mobile phone, but until the deadline, Huang Chulong’s phone was always forwarded to the answering machine, and Huang Chulong was out of touch. Guangjiang猛龙 Huang Chulong, a real estate developer in Xinhe, is well-known in Shenzhen. Drivers in Shenzhen are all familiar with the projects in Xinghe. The houses in Xinghe sell well because of their excellent location. A broker from Re/max 21st Century (Re/max 21st Century blog) told the reporter from Time Weekly that ""Yellow Boss is very strong, and he always gets good land in the central business district."" Around the three subway stations in the core area of Shenzhen Metro Line 1, there are four projects developed by Shenghe Real Estate. Like many property developers, Huang Chulong started out as a construction worker. He came to Shenzhen to start a business when the special economic zone was first established in 1979. He did the work of a mason very well, and later gradually became a contractor, undertaking the construction of Shennan Avenue (Shanghai Hotel to Shubu Road) in Shenzhen. With the first pot of gold earned as a construction boss, Huang Chulong established Shenzhen Yihetou Enterprise Co., Ltd. in 1998, which was the predecessor of Star River Real Estate. Huang Chulong transformed into a developer. In April 1994, Huang Chulong established Shenzhen Xin Yihuo Industrial Development Co., Ltd., and subsequently developed multiple projects such as Xianghe Garden, Yihuo Building, and Haiyue Huacheng. In December 1999, Xin Yihuo was renamed Shenzhen Star River Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. Shenzhen’s famous real estate commentator, Totem Mirror, recorded the “discussion” of Vanke Group chairman Wang Shi (Wang Shi blog), Shenghe Real Estate chairman Huang Chulong and Shenglian Real Estate (Shenglian Real Estate blog) consultant joint-stock company chairman Chen Jingsong at a dinner table on his blog. Chen Jingsong sighed at the dinner table that Shenzhen's private real estate companies had not been able to go out, and Huang Chulong immediately resonated: ""That's right, I have also been to many cities."" Deeply touched: unfamiliar with the land and water, and the water and soil are not suitable. Drink five catties of white wine at noon, and six catties in the evening. If you continue to drink, you will have to give your life, so I have to withdraw. It was this businessman, who was unfamiliar with the local conditions in other cities, who ran his real estate business in Shenzhen with ease. In Shenzhen, listed companies such as Vanke and China Merchants often cannot obtain land in the central area, which is monopolized by a few private real estate companies in Shenzhen. A person in charge of a large real estate company in Shenzhen told reporters from Times Weekly. Huang Chulong's star river is one of the ""monopoly big shots in the central area"". In 2002, the Star River International, located between Fuhua Third Road and Binhe Avenue, was sold smoothly, allowing Huang Chulong to truly stand firm in the central area of Shenzhen. By 2005, the projects of Star River Real Estate had blossomed. And they also caught the real estate boom in Shenzhen from 2005 to 2007. According to the statistics and analysis of the Shangdi #zhPoint#Baanqiu Studio, a real estate consulting firm in Shenzhen, for every 100 square meters of commercial buildings in Shenzhen's CBD, 12 square meters are supplied by Shenghe Real Estate. “Gongsi Men” shook off the past and compared with other real estate developers, the land reserve of Xinghe is not much, but it is precious in its ""scarcity"". In the real estate industry in Shenzhen, which is full of talents, this over-the-river dragon could defeat many opponents. The choice of land and the ability to acquire land are beyond doubt. In February 2003, Huang Chulong won the land auction in Shenzhen for a total price of 180 million yuan and a 8-year interest-free installment payment, and acquired the present Shenghe Development Center and the Ritz-Carlton project. On December 23, 2003, Huang Chulong suddenly turned his attention to the area outside the city and bought a plot of land of 170,000 square meters in Longgang District for 250 million yuan. Now, the plot of land, which is in Longgang Central City, is being developed as the planned political, economic, and cultural center of Longgang. Beyond its substantial financial strength, Huang Chulong’s ability to acquire land is also remarkable. The Shenzhen Land and Resources Bureau's records show that the two projects, Shenghe International and Shenghe Century, which Huang Chulong successfully developed in the city center, both have a ""agreed transfer"" source of ownership. Among them, the Star River International project was obtained in 1999. And the transfer date of the Star River Century Tower is September 13, 2004, and the source of property rights is also agreement transfer. After the deadline of land in August 31, 2004, all business land use rights must be transferred through bidding, auction, and listing. How did Star River obtain the land use rights for the Star River Century Tower project through agreement transfer? While the Southern Metropolis Daily reporters were verifying the information from multiple sources, on June 16, a case involving the Star River Century Tower was publicly tried at Futian District People's Court. Huang Chulong's involvement in the Xinghe Century project is alluded to in this case. According to the reporter of Time Weekly, the Star River Century plot was originally one of the plots involved in Shenzhen's ""returning land to the people"" policy, and the right to use belonged to the Gangxia Industrial Corporation. In March 2000, under the introduction of Dong Yongfeng Company, Shenzhen Gangxia signed a cooperation agreement with Jinfeng Company and Dong Yongfeng Company to jointly develop the land, with Gangxia Company providing residential land and Dong Yongfeng Company and Jinfeng Company providing construction funds. After the completion of the project, the company got 11,000 square meters of property, while the rest of the property belonged to Dong Yongfeng Company and Jinfeng Company. But during the process of development and construction, unexpected changes occurred. According to the 86 employees and shareholders of Jinfeng Company, on January 13, 2004, the legal representative of Jinfeng Company signed an agreement with Dong Yongfeng Company and Gangxia Company to withdraw from the development of the land. On January 12, 2004, Dong Yongfeng transferred the project to Star River Real Estate. The plaintiff believes that the legal representative of Jinfeng Company did not convene a board meeting and a shareholders' meeting, did not listen to the opinions of the trade union and employees, and withdrew from the development of the project without their consent, and merely recovered the initial investment cost, which caused economic losses to Jinfeng employees and shareholders. And believes that during the operation of the project, including the major shareholders of Jinfeng Company, Shenzhen Futian Investment Development Co., Ltd., Dongyongfeng Company, and several defendants such as the legal representative of Jinfeng Company, there was a malicious collusion, so they all sued the court. And Futian District People's Government was also sued as a defendant because it was believed to support and promote the infringement behavior of other defendants. The plot is complex and confusing. To this day, the information from the Shenzhen Land and Housing Bureau still shows that the developer of the Star River Century project is Shenzhen Dong Yongfeng Real Estate Co., Ltd., and the details of how Star River Real Estate intervened and obtained the Star River Century project through agreement transfer are still a mystery. Liu Shicheng, general manager of Xinghe Real Estate, told reporters from Times Weekly that he was unaware of the matter. ” Huang Chulong’s sense of the江湖, people in the real estate industry in Shenzhen always can’t help to evaluate him as generous, loyal, with many friends and broad social connections. The江湖 sentiment of Huang Chulong also laid the foundation for his status in the circle. The Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce's publicly available information shows that the Happy Enterprise Company, which Huang Chulong established earliest, had the Shatou Street Office of Shatou District, Shenzhen City, as a shareholder in the capacity of the supervisory unit. Huang Chulong's generosity is not only reflected in his real estate projects, but also in the descriptions and photos of his son's lavish wedding in 2007, which have been widely circulated on the Internet. A fellow villager of Huang Chulong revealed that Huang invited about 500 villagers to a hotel for a big feast, and gave each of them a 400 yuan red envelope, which was called the ""most amazing wedding"" by netizens. Those who are familiar with Huang Chulong have found that he wears a string of prayer beads on his wrist and neck. A source said that Huang Boss is a businessman who is good at making money, and at the same time, he is a believer who gives away his wealth to worship Buddha. Huang Chulong's business philosophy is also often talked about in the industry. When the reporters of Times Weekly visited the new headquarters of Star River Real Estate on the 17th to 24th floors of the Star River Development Center, they found the Yellow Clan's aphorisms pasted on different floors—""Good for you, good for me, good for everyone, that's really good""; ""Do things after being a person, be round on the outside and square on the inside."" I want to comment."

Jin Qian Online reported that the police set up a checkpoint at the toll station to check and intercept drugs, and caught a man and a woman on a bus. In the end, they followed the trail and arrested their upstream and upstream upstream one by one. Surprisingly, one of the drug dealers was a judicial officer. Recently, Guiyang Intermediate People's Court heard the case and made a first-instance judgment. At about 2 PM on November 24, 2007, the Guiyang police set up a checkpoint at the Jin Guan toll station in Guiyang. In a large bus from Liupanshui to Guiyang, 410 grams of heroin were found on a woman. Another man, Hu Yuanjie (from Zijin County, 57 years old now), who was traveling with the woman, was also arrested. After Hu Yuanjie was arrested, he expressed his willingness to make meritorious contributions and assist the public security organs in apprehending his superior, Tie Fachui and Ma Yuhuo, a couple from Yunnan. At 10:00 a.m. on November 29, 2014, the couple Tie Fachui and Ma Yuhuo, who were conducting drug transactions in a guesthouse on Health Road in Ludian County, Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province, were arrested by the police, and 468 grams of drugs were seized on the spot. After that, the police arrested drug dealer Wang Dehui at a hotel in the western district of Kunming at around 2:00 PM on December 2, based on clues provided by Hu Yuanjie, and seized 3050 grams of drugs. After Wang Dehui was arrested, she voluntarily confessed that the 3050 grams of heroin she sold was given to her by a man named Ning Gongwei, and at that time, the two agreed that Wang Dehui would find a buyer, and after the drug was sold, Wang Dehui would pay 750,000 yuan in drug money to Ning Gongwei, and the excess would be Wang Dehui's kickback. Ning Gongwei asked Wang Dehui to transfer 750,000 yuan of drug money into two bank cards and informed her of the card numbers of the two cards via text message. With Wang Dehui's cooperation, the police arrested Ning Gongwei in Lincang, Yunnan Province on the afternoon of March 7, 2008. It was found that Ning Gongwei is a judicial police officer of the Justice Bureau of Gengma County, Lincang City, Yunnan Province. Ning Gongwei admitted that in November 2007, he had negotiated with Wang Dehui to sell heroin, which he had obtained from a Burmese person. After that, he contacted Wang Dehui and handed over this batch of drugs to him. Recently, the Intermediate People's Court of Guiyang City made a first-instance judgment on this case, sentencing Ning Gongwei and Tie Fachuì to death for selling drugs, confiscating all their property; Ma Yuhé to life imprisonment, and confiscating 30,000 yuan of his property. Given that the defendant Wang Dehui and Hu Yuanjie had significant meritorious service, they were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve for the crime of selling drugs, confiscation of all personal property; Hu Yuanjie was sentenced to 15 years in prison and confiscation of 10,000 yuan in personal property.

专家：火箭腾空有三大隐患姚明不再受伤将是奇迹新浪体育讯　北京时间12月5日消息，star-telegram.com报道，综合现有信息，仔细地负责任地预测：休斯顿火箭将会以西部第五结束这个常规赛。火箭休赛期收获罗恩-阿泰斯特后，这种预测与那些膨胀的言论大相径庭，你知道，某些所谓专家看好这支球队能挺进总决赛。现在的火箭，看上去深受一个问题的困扰，那就是伤病。早在火箭的训练营期间，就有消息说经历过职业生涯首次手术后，麦蒂的膝盖仍然很疼。过去的四场比赛，麦蒂就因这个问题高挂免战牌。而且，据最新消息显示，这个7届全明星球员在接下来三周，都不会出现在球场上。过去三个赛季，麦蒂总共缺席了62场比赛。毋庸讳言，麦蒂是他这个年代最具才华的篮球运动员，但是在29岁这个年龄——或许，你会惊讶他竟然是如此年轻，经历过11个NBA赛季的敲打后，他已经伤病缠身。当麦蒂18岁以高中生身份进入这个联盟后，谁会想到11年之后的他会是今天这个样子。除了麦蒂的膝伤，火箭的另外两员主将姚明和阿泰斯特也各有麻烦，前者是脚，后者是头，其中任何一个“发作”，火箭的前景都不容乐观。过去三年，因为不同部位的伤病，姚明总共缺席了86场比赛。作为一个7尺6寸310磅的中锋，当姚明来回奔跑不断起跳时，他的身体承受着常人难以想象的压力。上赛季，姚明因为舟骨骨折错失了35场比赛，在火箭最需要他的时候赛季报销。手术后没过多长时间，姚明就超负荷运转，代表他的祖国参加了北京奥运会。所以，如果这个赛季姚明能全勤，那将是一个奇迹。再说说阿泰斯特。必须承认，阿泰斯特不缺乏天赋，他可以在攻防两端都打出统治级的表现，可在他的职业生涯里，他却时而弄出打架、虐待动物、为了宣传唱片而请假等麻烦事。麦蒂的膝、姚明的脚和阿泰斯特的头，这三个因素叠加，使得火箭成了联盟中最难以令人放心的球队。所有预测火箭有能力角逐总冠军的家伙都不会忘了加上一个前提——如果姚麦能保持健康，如果阿泰斯特不再惹是生非。当被问起球队的健康问题时，火箭主教练里克-阿德尔曼如是说：“我倒是想问你，‘明天我会拥有哪些球员(比赛和训练)？’至于球员的进出，这是一个永远没有头尾的话题。”毫无疑问，火箭的确很有竞争力，他们很长一段时间都是西南赛区的头名，在伤病满营的情况下，他们现在实际上做得还不错。因为那波22连胜，上赛季的火箭是最两人称奇的球队之一。而且，在后10场胜利中，球队中并没有姚明。除了1971-1972赛季湖人狂飙33连胜，火箭是历史上连胜场次最长的球队。但这些又代表了什么呢？	姚明,罗恩-阿泰斯特,阿泰斯特,麦蒂,姚麦,里克-阿德尔曼	正向	"Expert: There are three major hazards for the rocket to take off. Yao Ming will no longer be injured, which will be a miracle. Sina Sports News. On December 5th, according to star-telegram. com, based on the existing information, a careful and responsible prediction: Houston Rockets will end the regular season as the fifth in the west. After the Rockets acquired Ron Artest during the off-season, this prediction was quite different from those inflated claims, you know, from so-called experts who thought this team would make it to the finals. The current Rockets are troubled by one problem, that is, injuries. Even before the Rockets' training camp, there were reports that after his first career surgery, McGrady's knees were still in pain. In the past four games, McGrady sat out for this reason. And, according to the latest news, this seven-time All-Star player will not appear on the court for the next three weeks. Over the past three seasons, McGrady missed 62 games. It is not a secret that Tracy McGrady was the most talented basketball player of his generation, but at the age of 29 – perhaps, you would be surprised that he was so young – after 11 seasons in the NBA, he was already a broken man. Who would have thought that eleven years after entering the league as a high school student, Matt would be like this today. Besides Matti’s knee injury, the two other main players of Rockets, Yao and Artest, also have their own troubles, the former is foot, the latter is head, and Rockets’ prospects will not be optimistic if any of them “outbreaks”. Over the past three years, Yao Ming missed 86 games in total due to injuries in different parts of his body. As a 7-foot-6-inch, 310-pound center, Yao Ming's body bears unimaginable pressure when he runs back and forth and jumps constantly. Last season, Yao missed 35 games due to a navicular fracture, and was season-ending injured when the Rockets most needed him. Not long after the surgery, Yao Ming was overworking again, representing his country in the Beijing Olympics. So, if Yao Ming can play all the games in this season, it will be a miracle. Let's talk about Artest again. It must be admitted that Artest is not lacking in talent, and he can play dominantly on both ends of the court. However, in his career, he has caused trouble by fighting, abusing animals, and taking leave to promote his album. Metta World Peace's head, Yao Ming's foot, and Tracy McGrady's knee, these three factors combined made the Rockets the most unreliable team in the league. All the guys who predict that the Rockets have a chance to win the championship will not forget to add a premise - if Yao and Mccoy can stay healthy, if Artest will not cause trouble again. When asked about the team's health issues, Rick Adelman, the Rockets' coach, said, ""I should ask you, 'Which players will I have tomorrow (for games and training)? ' As for the comings and goings of the players, this is a topic that has no beginning or end. There is no doubt that the Rockets are very competitive, and they have been the top team in the Southwest Division for a long time. Under the circumstances of being full of injuries, they are actually doing quite well now. Because of that 22-game winning streak, last season's Rockets were one of the most astonishing teams. And, in the team's last 10 victories, there was no Yao Ming. Besides the Lakers’ 33-game winning streak in the 1971-1972 season, the Rockets are the team with the longest winning streak in history. But what do these represent?"
两岁娃一脚将茶几踢出缺口消费者当众怒砸“纸”家具欢欢喜喜搬进新家，却不想买回的“实木茶几”竟被2岁半的孩子一脚就踢出一个缺口来。仔细一看，才发现茶几表层薄薄的木皮下面竟全是蜂窝纸板。昨日，家住恒大名都的李先生和向先生气愤地来到万家丽路上某知名家居卖场，向商家讨个说法。消费者几锤下去砸开“纸”家具李先生和向先生同住恒大名都小区，是邻居。今年3月，他们一起在这家家居卖场的左右布艺沙发系列门店花25700元买回了两套沙发、两个茶几和两台电视柜。向先生一次性就支付了全款。“我之所以一次性付款，看中的就是‘左右’这个品牌，还有当时专柜工作人员宣称茶几和电视柜都是全实木的。”向先生表示。不过，让人意想不到的是，10月9日，李先生2岁半的孩子在家里玩耍时，不慎一脚踢到茶几上将其踢出一个口子。李先生仔细检查这个缺口，才发现木皮下面是一些硬纸片。昨日下午4时许，气愤的李先生和向先生将茶几和电视柜搬到这家家居卖场前坪，当众砸开。几锤下去再用力一拉，家具就被分成几片。里面不是木头，而是塞满了蜂窝状的硬纸板。商家蜂窝纸是新工艺，从未承诺是实木随后，记者跟随芙蓉区东屯渡工商所工作人员和向先生、李先生一起来到左右布艺沙发系列门店。店内销售人员对“口头承诺是实木家具”一说给予了否认，门店负责人也表示，他们从未向消费者承诺卖出的是实木家具，他们也并不销售实木家具。记者在现场仔细查看发现，店内确实没有实木家具的宣传，商品价目表上也没有标注其产品用的什么材质。那么，即便不是实木家具，用纸板做家具又是符合规定的吗？门店负责人随后拿出一叠证明产品合格的材料，并声称向先生和李先生购买的沙发是左右品牌，但茶几和电视柜不是左右牌的，而是他们的合作伙伴“文化龙”家具，该家具在宣传图册上明确标示是实木皮与高密度板制作而成，是两位消费者没有注意。“用蜂窝纸制作家具是业内很多家具厂商都在使用的方式，蜂窝纸节能环保，也是符合国家有关标准的。”这位负责人同时表示。工商部门要在合同上注明家具材质在仔细查看被消费者砸坏的家具，并向买卖双方了解情况后，芙蓉区东屯渡工商所所长陈钦表示，还需要进一步调查了解蜂窝纸工艺是不是符合相关国家标准和质量要求，同时要详细了解商品生产的具体流程。“目前暂不能确定左右沙发是否存在欺诈消费者的行为，工商部门将对此事展开调查。”	李先生,向先生,陈钦	负向	"A two-year-old child kicked a tea table with a gap. Consumers angrily smashed ""paper"" furniture in public. Joyfully moved into a new home, but did not expect that the ""solid wood tea table"" bought was kicked with a gap by a two-and-a-half-year-old child. Upon closer inspection, we found that the thin layer of wood veneer on the coffee table was actually all honeycomb cardboard. Yesterday, Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang, who live in Hengda Mingdu, came to a well-known home furnishing mall on Wanhua Li Road in anger to seek an explanation from the merchant. Consumers smashed the ""paper"" furniture with a few blows. Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang live in the Hengda Name Park, and they are neighbors. In March this year, they bought two sets of sofas, two coffee tables and two TV cabinets from the左右布艺 sofa series store in the home appliance mall together for 25,700 yuan. Mr. Xiang paid the full amount in one lump sum. I paid in full because I liked the brand ""Zuowei"" and the staff at the specialty counter claimed that the coffee table and TV cabinet were all made of solid wood at that time. Expressed to Mr. Xiang. However, unexpectedly, on October 9, Mr. Li’s 2.5-year-old child kicked a hole in the coffee table while playing at home. Mr. Li carefully examined the gap and found that there were some pieces of hard paper under the veneer. Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang, who were angry, moved the coffee table and TV cabinet to the front of this home furnishings mall yesterday afternoon and smashed them in public. A few blows and a strong pull, and the furniture is split into several pieces. It is not wood, but filled with honeycomb cardboard. Honeycomb paper of the merchant is a new process, and it has never promised to be solid wood. Later, the journalist followed the staff of Dongtundu Industrial and Commercial Office of Fenghuang District and Mr. Xiang and Mr. Li to the store of左右布艺sofa series. The sales staff in the store denied the oral commitment to be solid wood furniture, and the store manager also stated that they never promised to sell solid wood furniture to consumers, and they do not sell solid wood furniture. The reporter carefully checked the scene and found that there was indeed no promotion of solid wood furniture in the store, and there was no indication of what materials were used in the products on the price list. So, even if it is not solid wood furniture, is it in compliance to make furniture out of cardboard? Then the store manager took out a stack of documents proving that the products were qualified, and claimed that the sofa purchased by Mr. Shang and Mr. Li was from the ""Left and Right"" brand, but the coffee table and TV cabinet were not from the ""Left and Right"" brand, but from their partner ""Culture Dragon"" furniture, which was clearly marked as made of real wood veneer and high density board in the promotional brochure, which the two consumers had not noticed. Using honeycomb paper to make furniture is a way that many furniture manufacturers use. Honeycomb paper is energy-saving and environmentally friendly, and it also meets the relevant national standards. The official also stated. The Administration for Industry and Commerce should note the material of the furniture on the contract. After carefully checking the furniture that was damaged by the consumer and understanding the situation from both parties, Chén Qīn, the director of the Dōngtūndu Subdistrict Office of Fúróng District, said that they still need to further investigate whether the honeycomb paper process meets relevant national standards and quality requirements, and to understand the specific production process of the goods in detail. It is currently uncertain whether Left and Right Sofas have engaged in fraudulent practices against consumers. The industrial and commercial administrative department will investigate this matter.

Zhao Baogang directed ""Marriage Defense War"" before it was filmed, and Ma Yili and Tony Dai were reunited. Both of them have married and had children, and now they are both fathers and mothers. I wonder if the story of the family can have its own shadow? Besides being busy with her career, Ma Yi was also invited by the organizing committee of the ""Message of Love"" competition in Shanghai to specially write a message of love for her daughter. Since giving birth to her daughter safely in Shanghai on September 20, 2008, Ma Yi, in addition to her fresh and sweet temperament, has also been radiating maternal glow everywhere. She jokingly said that she is a very traditional person who can sacrifice her career for her family. This short message does not contain fancy words or flights of fancy, but rather displays a more generous maternal love in the most sincere and simple language, and calls on humans to pay attention to the protection of the environment for the next generation: If you love your child, protect the natural environment on which humans depend for survival for him/her! The following is the original text of the message: To my dearest treasure: I hope you can still live in a green world when you grow up, so that I don't have to worry about the water you drink and the air you breathe many years later. For the environment on which the next generation depends, we must now start to pay attention to environmental protection! Love your mother Mai?"

台湾偶像剧一周收视：《痞子英雄》意犹未尽新浪娱乐讯本周(6.22——6.28)《痞子英雄》播出电视版的完结篇，结局意犹未尽，收视率飙到开播以来的最高点，以4.0的平均收视击败同时段金曲奖颁奖典礼，拿下收视冠军。而周日档的《福气又安康》也以4.36的收视率冲上开播以来最高点，男女主角陈乔恩、蓝正龙、邱泽坐摩天轮庆功，寓意收视继续攀高。《痞子英雄》：意犹未尽的结局《痞子英雄》以24集结束电视版的剧情，结局当中，陈在天、小马、吴英雄三人作为正义一方勇战雇佣兵组织萨科奇首脑，周渝民等人大展拳脚功夫的武打戏成为大结局中的高潮。许多的悬念被留到电影版。由于导演的野心是不止做一部电视剧这么简单，因此观众们也只好在猜测着剧情中等待电影版问世。严格说起来，电视版只能算是故事的三分之二，人物的关系框架刚刚形成，真正的重头戏还在后头。这种电视+电影标新立异的做法尽管很有新意，但就电视版而言，却是个过分仓促的结局。何小玫的突然出现，陈在天与陈琳的感情线索，新出现幕后组织天堂的真正目的，这都是电视剧留下的大把悬念。充满悬念的结局让相当一部分观众感到意犹未尽。尽管结局看起来有点莫名其妙，这部剧仍以4.06的收视率完美收官。纵观自一开始就号称要“代表台湾目前最高制作水平”的《痞子英雄》，的确在许多方面为台湾偶像剧开拓新领域，无愧宣传时提出的口号。无论是尽量像美剧的紧凑节奏靠拢的剧情，还是以高成本制作的爆破枪战场面，都让人对台湾偶像剧产生全新认识：偶像剧除了情情爱爱，还能有如《越狱》般环环相扣的高智商剧情，让观众也能够带着悬念和猜谜的乐趣参与偶像剧。一部真正的好剧，各方面都要配合得天衣无缝，其中责任最大的当然是观众们最关注的演员，他们在镜头下用心表演，观众们能否理解剧情，多半要靠他们。这部剧集聚了台湾电视圈的大批优秀新老演员，姜是老的辣，老演员的老戏骨精神自然史毋庸置疑。青年一辈中赵又廷、陈意涵等人卖力演出，给观众们留下深刻印象，赵又廷的酷，陈意涵的可爱，在这部戏当中淋漓尽致地展现，可以预见到的是，通过这部制作优良的好剧，他们的演艺之路将更加顺畅。整部戏的灵魂人物是仔仔周渝民，他发挥出表演九年的功力，将有史以来最好的表演都奉献给痞子陈在天这个角色。就连蔡岳勋导演也高调评价说周渝民已经脱离偶像派，开始进入演员的成熟期。《福气又安康》领跑周日档偶像剧《福气又安康》日前已经播出第四集，连续四周收视夺冠，让女主角陈乔恩“收视女王”的宝座愈坐愈稳。周日档偶像剧目前是《福气》一枝独秀的局面，中视播出的韩剧《花样男子流星花园》与华视的《敲敲爱上你》在收视率上根本无法与之抗衡。偶像剧向来最喜欢以男女主角的甜蜜吻戏做卖点来吸引收视率，在第五集预告中，就出现男主角蓝正龙和陈乔恩的吻戏，相信到时会引发《福气又安康》收视率的小高潮。(小二/文)周日档偶像剧收视率排行周日21:30-24:00(2009.6.28)1福气又安康(台视)4.362花样男子流星花园(中视)2.83敲敲爱上你(华视)0.61	陈乔恩,蓝正龙,邱泽,陈在天,小马,吴英雄,周渝民,何小玫,陈琳,姜,赵又廷,陈意涵,蔡岳勋	正向	"Taiwan idol drama weekly ratings: ""The Hero of the Villain"" is still unsatisfied. Sina Entertainment News. This week (6.22-6.28) ""The Hero of the Villain"" broadcast the finale of the TV version, the ending is still unsatisfied, the ratings soared to the highest point since the opening, with an average rating of 4.0, defeating the Golden Melody Awards ceremony at the same time, winning the ratings champion. And on Sunday, Fuki You Kangang also reached the highest point since its broadcast with a rating of 4.36, with the male and female leads Chen Qiong'eng, Lan Zhenglong, and Qiu Ze celebrating the success by riding a Ferris wheel, symbolizing that the ratings will continue to rise. 痞子英雄: A Satisfying Ending The 24 episodes of The Heroes of the Zodiac ended the TV version of the plot, and in the ending, Chen Zaitian, Xiaoma, and Wu Hero fought bravely against the head of the mercenary organization Saccochi as the righteous side. The martial arts fight of Zhou Yumin and others, who showed their kung fu, became the climax of the ending. Many suspense is left to the movie version. Since the director's ambition is not just to make a TV series, the audience can only wait for the movie version to come out in suspense. To be precise, the TV version is only two-thirds of the story, and the framework of the characters is just beginning to take shape, with the real main plot still to come. Though this TV+movie approach is innovative, it is an overly hasty conclusion for the TV version. Hao Xiaomei's sudden appearance, Chen Zaitian and Chen Lin's love story, and the true purpose of the newly emerged secret organization Paradise are all the big suspense left by the TV series. The suspenseful ending left a large number of viewers unsatisfied. Despite the somewhat mysterious ending, the show ended on a perfect note with a viewership of 4.06. Looking at痞子英雄, which claimed from the beginning to ""represent the current highest production level of Taiwan"", it has indeed opened up new fields for Taiwanese idol dramas in many aspects, living up to the slogans proposed in the publicity. Whether it is the plot that strives to be as compact as American TV series, or the high-cost production of the explosion and gun battle scenes, it has given people a new understanding of Taiwanese idol dramas: idol dramas can have high IQ plots like ""Prison Break"" that are intricately linked, allowing viewers to participate in idol dramas with suspense and the fun of guessing. A truly good drama requires seamless cooperation in all aspects, and of course, the actors who are most concerned by the audience are the ones who bear the greatest responsibility. They perform with their hearts in front of the camera, and whether the audience can understand the plot is largely dependent on them. This drama gathered a large number of excellent new and old actors in the Taiwan TV circle, and the veteran actors' veteran actors' spirit is naturally beyond doubt. In the young generation, Zhao Yutong and Chen Yihan gave a powerful performance, leaving a deep impression on the audience. The coolness of Zhao Yutong and the cuteness of Chen Yihan were fully displayed in this play. It can be foreseen that through this excellent production, their acting road will be smoother. The soul of the whole play is Zai Zai Zhou Yumin, who has played for nine years and has given the best performance to the role of Tian Panzi Chen. Even director Cai Yuexun praised Zhou Yumin's maturity as an actor, saying that he has already transcended the idol category. With ""Good Luck and Good Health"" leading the Sunday drama slot, the show has already aired its fourth episode and has been the top-rated show for four consecutive weeks, making Mavis Chien's ""Queen of Ratings"" position more and more stable. Currently, the variety show on Sundays is dominated by ""Good Fortune"". The Korean drama ""Boys Over Flowers"" broadcast by CTS and ""Knock Knock, I Love You"" broadcast by ETS are completely unable to compete with it in terms of ratings. Romantic comedies always like to use the sweet kiss scenes of the male and female leads as a selling point to attract viewership. In the fifth episode preview, there is a kiss scene between the male lead, Zhenglong Lan, and Chen Qiong. It is believed that it will cause a small peak in the viewership of ""Prosperity and Peace"".

王学兵继任“反家暴”大使宣传海报出炉(组图)新浪娱乐讯日前，由演员王学兵担任形象大使的反家暴公益组织，正式公布09年新款宣传海报，宣扬“不要暴力好好爱”的反家暴主题。化身志愿者手握爱心11月25日是“国际消除对妇女的暴力日”，即“反家暴日”。为了更好宣传反家暴活动，反家暴组织今年特意邀请形象大使王学兵拍摄了新款海报。海报上，王学兵站在正中央，身后并排站着的是医生、警察、法官等社会各界人士代表。王学兵身穿志愿者服装，手握爱心，笑容灿烂，呼吁众人“不要暴力好好爱——消除性别暴力，建立平等关系”。自付路费冒雪赶拍新海报为了拍摄本次海报，王学兵可谓是颇费周折。由于之前在上海赶拍新剧《浦江之东》，王学兵特意从片场请假赶回北京，却不幸遇上暴风雪。王学兵冒着风雪从机场直奔摄影棚，一直拍摄到凌晨1点多才正式收工。整个拍摄过程中，王学兵认真敬业的工作态度让现场所有工作人员赞叹不已。据工作人员透露，王学兵还主动提出自付来回路费，为公益事业贡献自己的一份力。连任反家暴大使尽职尽责据悉，王学兵自2002年以来，就开始担任“反对家庭暴力”形象大使。多年来，王学兵一直尽职尽责，积极参与由联合国妇女儿童基金会等相关组织举办的各项公益活动，倡导两性平等，呼吁社会各界人士反对家庭暴力。王学兵表示：“作为反家暴大使，我希望能通过自己的努力，让大家都提高认识，反对家庭暴力。”(邢远/文)	王学兵,邢远	正向	"Wang Xuebing, the successor of the ""anti-domestic violence"" ambassador, has released a series of promotional posters (photo) for the anti-domestic violence public welfare organization (Sina Entertainment News). Recently, the anti-domestic violence public welfare organization, which was undertaken by actor Wang Xuebing as the image ambassador, officially released the new promotional posters of 2009, promoting the theme of ""no violence, love well"". Transform into a volunteer holding a heart on November 25, which is the ""International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women"", also known as ""Domestic Violence Awareness Day"".

Wang Xuebing, wearing a volunteer uniform, holding a heart, smiling brightly, calling on everyone to ""not use violence and love well - eliminate gender violence and establish equal relationships."" To shoot the new poster, Wang Xuebing had to travel in the snow and pay for his own fare, which was quite a hassle. Due to the new drama ""Pudong River East"" that was shot in Shanghai, Wang Xuebing specially took leave from the set to return to Beijing, but unfortunately, he met a blizzard. Wang Xuebing rushed from the airport to the film studio in the snowstorm and kept shooting until after 1 a.m. before officially wrapping up. Throughout the entire filming process, Wang Xuebing's hardworking and dedicated work attitude amazed all the staff on the set. According to the staff, Wang Xuebing also proactively offered to pay for his round-trip fare and contribute to public welfare. Re-elected anti-domestic violence ambassador is diligent and responsible. It is reported that since 2002, Wang Xuebing has been serving as the ""anti-domestic violence"" image ambassador.

山东史上最牛外援有尴尬近几年混迹西亚并不得意新浪体育讯　萨马基·沃克加盟山东黄金让CBA瞩目，不过从他的简历表上，除了2005——2006赛季最后效力于步行者之外，最近几年沃克的行踪成了疑问，实际上，这几年他没有干别的，除了打IBL这样的低级别比赛，沃克一直在“混”西亚。1996——2006年间，沃克分别为小牛、马刺、湖人热队、奇才和步行者队效力，平均每场比赛贡献5.4分和4.8个篮板球。在步行者经历了一个只打了7场比赛的尴尬后，沃克到低级别的IBL联赛为一支名为森塔芭芭拉突破者队效力，之后，他开始了他的海外之旅，先是加盟了叙利亚第二大城市阿勒颇的扎拉俱乐部，然后转会到了约旦的约旦泽恩俱乐部，并在那里为球队赢得了迪拜国际公开赛的亚军，那场比赛他们输给了黎巴嫩的里雅迪俱乐部。2008——2009赛季，他加盟了黎巴嫩的萨格西俱乐部，在那里，他为这支球队效力了一个月。不过在那里的一段时间沃克过得并不愉快，他表示，“自己的俱乐部队友水平太低，我把球传给他们，他们几乎不知道怎么打”，同时，因金融危机，该家也不能兑现沃克的合同待遇，这让曾经在科比和奥尼尔身边助阵并获得一枚总冠军戒指的他不得不离开黎巴嫩，并在中国的CBA找到了新工作。(康王河)	萨马基·沃克,沃克,科比,奥尼尔	正向	"Shandong's most outstanding foreign player has been embarrassed in recent years, wandering in the Middle East and not successful. Sina Sports News. Samaki Walker's joining Shandong Gold made CBA pay attention, but from his resume, except for the last season of 2005-2006, Walker's whereabouts in recent years have become a question. In fact, in recent years, Walker has not done anything else, except to play in low-level IBL, Walker has been ""wandering"" in the Middle East. From 1996 to 2006, Walker played for the Mavericks, Spurs, Lakers, Heat, and Wizards, averaging 5.4 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. After the步行者 experienced an embarrassing 7-game stint, Walker joined the low-level IBL league for Santa Barbara Breakers, and then began his overseas journey, first joining Zara Club in Aleppo, Syria, and then transferring to Jordan Zein Club in Jordan, where he won the runner-up of the Dubai International Open, losing to the Riyadi Club from Lebanon. In the 2008-2009 season, he joined the Sagex club in Lebanon, where he played for the team for a month. But Walker did not have a good time there, he said, ""My club teammates are too low level, I pass the ball to them, they almost do not know how to play"", at the same time, due to the financial crisis, the club could not fulfill Walker's contract benefits, which made him, who once assisted beside Kobe and Shaq and won a championship ring, leave Lebanon and find a new job in the CBA in China.

黄金周建材促销热市场冷低迷行情难突破“金九”已踏空，“银十”或可期。“十一黄金周”是各大建材商家不愿错失的销售良机，也被不少消费者认为是一年内市场价格最低的时段。全国各地卖场纷纷推出各种促销活动：优惠折扣、现金抽奖、样品特价、赠品礼包、限量抢购、千元竞拍、总裁签售……活动一波接一波，规模和力度堪称一年之最。本报驻全国各地20多个记者采访后得知，总体来看，“十一”期间的促销情况没有商家预计那么好，市场情势不容乐观，卖场促销凉意袭人；不过也有局部地区、个别卖场表现不错。市场观望气氛浓厚北京，天气微凉，但是各大卖场以及商家假日促销的热情不减，铆足了劲，期望能在国庆长假期间有所斩获。“十一”促销期间，记者来到北四环居然之家，见到很多店面都门庭冷落，包括美标这样的国际品牌，店内产品也无人问津，箭牌卫浴展厅入口处的人员相对较多，因店内打5、6折，吸引了不少顾客。据罗马卫浴的导购员介绍，今年他们店面销售额与往年相比下降了一半，整个卖场的销售也不如以前，比较冷清。在“十一”期间，居然之家瓷砖区更显冷清，每家店内都没有什么顾客。据业内经销商介绍，今年很多品牌销售额都处于下滑阶段，能保持与往年持平就算是表现不错。华耐工作人员顾程在面对北京销售困境时比较乐观。据他介绍，今年瓷砖的销售额还处于上升，只是增加幅度与往年相比要小一些。“金九银十”虽然说是销售旺季，但北京受到限房政策的影响，让很多潜在的消费群体都处于观望的状态，目前还很难打开这个局面。记者从北京海淀区建材城、万家灯火装饰城、“好家居”建材装饰市场等大型卖场了解到，民众的真实购买需求被抑制，市场观望气氛浓厚，预计“银十”销售量也很难取得突破性进展。市场遇冷行情低迷上海市宜山路建材市场地处热闹的徐家汇商圈，是当地最大的建材家装市场之一。在科拉胜、兴力达、喜盈门、佳饰家等卖场，大小促销活动不断。据记者观察，“十一”黄金周前三天个别品牌企业人气较旺，如TOTO卫浴，但总体上行情低迷。据了解，上半年科拉胜建材市场的收入比3年前缩水了六七成。记者在走访过程中了解到，一些商家在苦苦坚守之后，已经考虑转行了。9月底以来，受台风“纳沙”影响，广西东南地区持续降雨，整个国庆黄金周的商家促销活动几乎全部“泡汤”。国庆之前，不少经销商都指望“这个黄金周冲销量”，按往年行情来看，国庆节作为产品促销的最重要节点之一，可占到全年销售额的15%-17%。然而国庆以来持续强降雨天气，给消费者外出购物造成极大不便。南宁富安居(琅东)建材广场的客流量比平时多了一些，但是与卖场的喜庆气氛相比，还是显得冷清。部分商家表示，“金九银十”变“冷九寒十”，全年惨淡几成定局。在“十一”黄金周期间，成都陶瓷市场几家欢喜几家愁。富森·美家居和红星美凯龙在国庆长假的头两天人气不减，而博美装饰城(西门)和新世纪装饰城却显得多少有些冷清，人流量明显不及前两个市场。富森华润建材、安华卫浴、金意陶等行业知名品牌的店面销售人员忙得不亦乐乎，俨然成为国庆促销大戏的主角；而大多数二三线品牌的销售情况比平常好不了多少。昆明各大建材市场上，记者看到在促销的带动下，各建材市场的人流量比平时有了显著提升。在走访中，部分商家对“十一”期间的销售量表示满意，基本上达到预期。但整个市场的销售情况仍然没有预期的理想。消费潜力有待释放在以往“金九银十”期间，建材行业的销售状况与商家的让利促销活动有很大关系，商家只要在节假日发起促销活动，销售情况都会不错。今年的建材行业受楼市调控政策以及轮番加息银根紧缩的影响，与楼市现状一样一直处于低迷的状态。据不完全统计，9月全国楼市销量再度出现显著下滑。全国主要城市9月以来新房周均销售量环比下降25%，其中，一线城市下降31%，二线城市下降22%，三线城市下降23%。	顾程,科拉胜	负向	"The promotion of building materials during the Golden Week is hot, but the market is cold and depressed, and it is difficult to break through the situation. ""Golden September"" has missed its opportunity, and ""Silver October"" may be possible. The “National Day Golden Week” is a golden opportunity for building materials merchants not to miss, and is also considered by many consumers to be the period with the lowest market prices of the year. Promotional activities such as discount sales, cash lottery, special prices for samples, gift packages, limited edition抢购, thousand yuan bidding, and CEO signing are being launched in stores across the country. The scale and intensity of the activities are the largest of the year. After more than 20 reporters from our local bureaus across the country interviewed, it was found that overall, the promotional situation during the ""National Day"" period was not as good as the merchants expected, and the market situation was not optimistic, with a chill in the promotional situation in the sales area; however, there were also some local areas and individual sales areas that performed well. The market is in a state of cautious observation. In Beijing, the weather is slightly cool, but the enthusiasm of major retail outlets and merchants for holiday promotions has not diminished. They are working hard, hoping to achieve some success during the National Day holiday. During the ""National Day"" promotion, the reporter went to the USI in Beisihuan Fourth Ring Road and saw that many shops were deserted, including international brands such as American Standard, and the products in the store were not sought after. There were relatively more people at the entrance of the Arrow bathroom exhibition hall, as the store was offering a 5-6 discount, attracting many customers. According to the salesperson of the Rome bathroom, their store sales this year have dropped by half compared to last year, and the sales of the entire mall are not as good as before, and are rather cold. During the “National Day” holiday, the tiles area of Zhongshan Home was even more deserted, with no customers in each store. According to the dealers in the industry, the sales of many brands have been in a declining stage this year, and it is considered a good performance to maintain the same level as last year. Gu Cheng, a Huinai staff member, is more optimistic about the sales difficulties in Beijing. According to him, the sales of tiles this year are still rising, but the increase is smaller than in previous years. Although the “golden September and silver October” is said to be the peak sales season, the impact of the housing restriction policy on Beijing has made many potential consumers in a state of observation, and it is still difficult to open up this situation at present. Journalists learned from large sales venues such as Building Materials City, Wanliasudeng Decoration City, and ""Good Home"" Building Materials Decoration Market in Haidian District, Beijing, that the real purchasing demand of the people is suppressed, and the market atmosphere of watching and waiting is thick. It is expected that the sales volume of ""Silver October"" will also be difficult to achieve breakthrough progress. The market is lukewarm and the performance is low. The Shanghai Yishan Road Building Materials Market is located in the bustling Xujiahui business district and is one of the largest building materials and home decoration markets in the local area. There are constant large and small promotional activities in Kolaseng, Xinglidala, Xiyiming, Jashijia, and other sales venues. According to the reporters, the brands and enterprises were relatively popular in the first three days of the ""Golden Week"" of October, such as TOTO sanitary ware, but the overall market was depressed. It is understood that the revenue of the Kola Sheng building materials market in the first half of the year has shrunk by six or seven tenths compared to three years ago. During the visit, the journalists learned that some merchants, after struggling to hold on, have already considered changing their careers. Since the end of September, the southeastern region of Guangxi has experienced continuous rainfall due to Typhoon Nasa, and most of the merchants' promotional activities during the National Day Golden Week have been ""washed away"". Before the National Day, many dealers expected to ""boost sales during the Golden Week"". According to the previous year's situation, the National Day, as one of the most important nodes for product promotion, could account for 15%-17% of the annual sales. However, the continuous heavy rainfall since the National Day has caused great inconvenience for consumers to go out for shopping. The foot traffic at the Nanning Fu An Ji (Langdong) Building Materials Plaza is a little more than usual, but it still seems quiet compared to the festive atmosphere of the store. Some merchants said that ""golden September and silver October"" had turned into ""cold September and bitter October"", and the gloomy situation would be a certainty throughout the year. During the ""National Day"" Golden Week, some ceramic markets in Chengdu were happy while others were sad. Fushun Meijia and Red Star Macalline were still crowded on the first two days of the National Day holiday, while Bohme Decoration City (West Gate) and New Century Decoration City were somewhat deserted, with significantly fewer visitors than the first two markets. Salespeople of well-known brands such as FuSen CCB Construction Materials, Anhua sanitary ware, and Jin Yi Tiao have been busily engaged in the National Day promotion, becoming the main actors of the promotion drama; while the sales of most second and third-tier brands are not much better than usual. In the major building materials markets of Kunming, the journalists saw that the foot traffic in the markets was significantly higher than usual due to the promotion. During the visits, some merchants expressed satisfaction with the sales during the National Day holiday, which basically met their expectations. But the overall sales performance of the market still did not meet expectations. Consumption Potential is Yet to be Released During the previous ""Golden September and Silver October"", the sales performance of the building materials industry was closely related to the promotional activities of merchants. As long as merchants launched promotional activities during holidays, the sales situation would be good. The construction materials industry, like the real estate market, has been in a depressed state this year, affected by real estate market regulation policies and a series of interest rate hikes that have tightened the money supply. According to an incomplete statistics, the sales of the national real estate market in September fell significantly again. 新房 sales volume in major cities across the country fell by 25% on a weekly basis in September, with first-tier cities falling by 31%, second-tier cities by 22%, and third-tier cities by 23%."

The macroeconomic situation of A-share was relatively calm. The Dragon Tiger List of China Aluminum Industry on Friday after the strong limit-up showed that the speculators launched a sudden attack, while the institutions sold out. On the one hand, it shows that the speculators have begun to participate in the style conversion from the beginning of last week, from the炒作of Longji Technology and other Internet of Things, electronic information stocks to the large-cap weight stocks. On the other hand, it also shows that the main institutions are still slightly cautious in their efforts to increase the market, and only the following effect is shown. On the plate, the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, Pearl River Delta, and banking categories have the largest increase. Many drought-resistant stocks are in the top of the increase list. Daidu Water Conservancy, Lio Group, Anhui Water Conservancy, etc. have risen sharply, while Qianjiang Water Conservancy, which was launched before, has been corrected. Last week's star performer, Bao Guang Corporation, continued its strong advance. Whether it can lead the high-speed rail sector to strengthen is worth our continuous tracking.

It was built by Romanian Prince Vlad the Impale in 1212. It covers 20 mu and has 17 bedrooms, which can overlook the beautiful scenery of the hillside and countryside. The current owner, Dominic von Hapsburg, runs it like a museum. The castle was built in 1212, and from 1920 to early 1948, Queen Maria of the Habsburgs lived here. After the Communist Party took over the Romanian government, it expelled Queen Marie and her family in 1948. Dominic, who originally lived in the castle with his grandmother, Queen Marie, also went into exile abroad and eventually settled in the United States. The castle has become a popular tourist destination, and a famous tourist attraction, earning the Romanian government a lot of tourism revenue, because it is related to the legend of Count Dracula, the vampire of the 15th century.

媒体称韩国渔船船长因闯入日本海域被逮捕当地时间13日，一艘韩国渔船误入日本专属经济区，船长因无视警告被日方扣留。日本海上保安厅与韩国海洋警察厅的船只因此短暂对峙，但随后便进行了联合调查。渔船不顾警告逃离日本媒体称，13日10点半左右，日本水产厅的巡逻船在兵库县附近日本专属经济区内，发现了一艘可疑船只，于是跟踪该船行踪，最终发现这艘船是在日本专属经济区内从事捕蟹的韩国渔船。水产厅巡逻船立刻要求该船停船并停止作业，接受检查，而韩国渔船发现行踪暴露，便不顾警告逃离现场。日本巡逻船立刻通知了在附近海域游弋的海上保安厅舰船，请求协助追捕韩国渔船。11点半左右，日方以违反本国的相关渔业法律为由，将韩国渔船拦截，并将船长逮捕。但此消息未得到韩国方面确认。据报道，该渔船在逃离过程中曾报警，韩国海警所属的5001舰接到消息后赶赴现场。在经过双方沟通之后，日方表示同意和韩方共同调查此事。双方经调查后核实，“韩国渔船的确侵犯日本专属经济区。韩称渔船只是漂进日本海韩国媒体随后证实，称进入日本专属经济区的渔船是“33双龙”号。但双方对渔船侵入日本专属经济区的说法意见不一。韩国媒体不认可韩渔船在日本专属经济区内作业的说法。该媒体引述韩国政府官员的话说，该渔船进入只是误入日本专属经济区，并没有实施作业，是因为发动机故障随波漂流到了日本海域。日本海上保安厅没有用“对峙”来形容两国海上安保力量的相遇。韩国政府表示希望此事不会影响到两国之间的合作气氛。(张乐)>相关报道：韩日海警在争议岛附近海域调查对峙事件韩日警备船对峙已证实因韩船侵犯日海域	张乐	负向	"The media reported that the captain of a South Korean fishing boat was arrested for entering Japanese waters. On the 13th, a South Korean fishing boat mistakenly entered Japan's exclusive economic zone, and the captain was detained by the Japanese side for ignoring the warning. The Japanese Coast Guard and the South Korean Marine Police faced off briefly, but then conducted a joint investigation. The fishing boat ignored the warning and fled. The Japanese media reported that at around 10:30 am on the 13th, a patrol boat of the Japanese Fisheries Agency discovered a suspicious ship in the Japanese exclusive economic zone near Hyogo Prefecture, and then tracked the ship's whereabouts, and finally found that the ship was a Korean fishing boat engaged in crab fishing in the Japanese exclusive economic zone. The fisheries patrol boat immediately requested the ship to stop and stop working to accept inspection, while the Korean fishing boat, finding its tracks exposed, fled the scene despite the warning. Japanese patrol boats immediately notified the coast guard vessels patrolling in the nearby sea and requested assistance in pursuing the Korean fishing boat. Around 11:30, the Japanese side intercepted the Korean fishing boat and arrested the captain on the grounds that it violated the relevant fisheries laws of its own country. But this message has not been confirmed by the Korean side. It was reported that the fishing boat had sounded the alarm during the escape, and the 5001 warship of the Korean coast guard rushed to the scene after receiving the message. After the two sides communicated, the Japanese side agreed to investigate the matter together with the South Korean side. After the investigation, both sides confirmed that ""the South Korean fishing boat did indeed infringe on Japan's exclusive economic zone."" The South Korean fishing boat was only washed into the Sea of Japan, and the South Korean media later confirmed that the fishing boat that entered the Japanese EEZ was the ""33 Shuanglong""号. But the two sides have different views on the allegation that the fishing boat intruded into Japan's EEZ. The South Korean media do not recognize the claim that the South Korean fishing boat worked in the Japanese EEZ. The media quoted a South Korean government official as saying that the fishing boat had only strayed into Japan’s EEZ by mistake and had not carried out any operations, and that it had drifted into Japanese waters due to engine failure. The Japan Coast Guard did not use the term ""confrontation"" to describe the encounter between the two countries' maritime security forces. The South Korean government expressed hope that the incident would not affect the atmosphere of cooperation between the two countries.

陈水扁机要费案今日再审要求吴淑珍须出庭应讯中新网9月19日电据台湾《联合报》报道，台北地方法院今天开庭审理“国务机要费”案，陈水扁妻子吴淑珍日前递送陈明状，表示因身体不佳无法到庭，但遭合议庭驳回；合议庭并指示台大医院搬运病床、急救设施及药品到第八法庭，医师及护士今天到庭待命，显现今天非要吴淑珍到庭不可的决心。吴淑珍十六日委任律师向法院递状，表示她“几近每天昏厥一至二次”，无法出庭；但合议庭以她未附诊断证明，且台大医院已配合法院做好医疗准备，吴淑珍出庭不致有立即的生命危险，驳回她的声请。陈水扁办公室昨天发布新闻稿，否认吴淑珍曾提出请假要求，表示是向法院提出刑事“陈明状”，恳请法院偕同台大专业医疗人员了解吴淑珍是否适合出庭。至于外传陈水扁可能以“辅佐人”身分陪同吴淑珍出庭；亲扁人士透露，扁、珍的身分同属被告，陈水扁“不适宜、也没必要”担任吴淑珍的辅佐人。扁办虽否认吴淑珍向法院“请假”，但台北地院行政庭长黄俊明说，被告递状是否属于请假，要看内容而定；吴淑珍陈明状有请假的意思。法界人士认为，扁办否认吴淑珍请假，辩称只是递“刑事陈明状”，但明眼人一看内容，就是在请假，扁办何必玩文字游戏。吴淑珍委任律师李胜雄、廖学兴十六日下午向法院递交陈明状指出，吴淑珍六月底骨折，必须支撑抬高；上个月又感冒，迄今未愈，最近一周几乎每天昏厥一至二次。台北地院指出，合议庭决定每开庭半小时就休息十分钟，若有必要，吴淑珍可以躺在法庭准备的病床上应讯，而且有台大医院医疗设备及专业医护人员在法庭内待命，吴淑珍必须到庭应讯。另据报道，为顺利传讯吴淑珍，台大医院应法院要求，指派医护人员及急救相关设备进驻。不过，遭指派到庭待命的医护都避之唯恐不及。据了解，台大急诊部最后只能经由协调，由一名医师和一名护理人员今天到台北地院待命，对吴淑珍可能的状况，急诊部已沙盘推演。陈水扁办公室称吴淑珍并未提出请假要求机要费案将再开庭陈水扁称吴淑珍近日昏倒两次	陈水扁,扁,吴淑珍,黄俊明,李胜雄,廖学兴	正向	"Chen Shui-bian's confidential fee case was reviewed today, and Wu Shu-chen was required to appear in court. On September 19, China News Network reported that the Taipei District Court held a hearing on the ""state confidential fee"" case today. Chen Shui-bian's wife Wu Shu-chen submitted a statement to the court yesterday, stating that she was unable to appear in court due to poor health, but was rejected by the collegial panel. The collegial panel also instructed the National Taiwan University Hospital to move a hospital bed, emergency facilities and medicines to the eighth court, and doctors and nurses were on standby in court today, showing the determination that Wu Shu-chen must appear in court today. Wu Shuzhen was appointed a lawyer on the 16th to submit a lawsuit to the court, stating that she fainted ""once or twice a day almost every day"", and could not appear in court; but the collegial panel rejected her application, as she had no medical certificate, and the National Taiwan University Hospital had already made medical preparations in accordance with the court, and Wu Shuzhen's appearance in court would not pose an immediate danger to her life. Chen Shui-bian's office issued a press release yesterday, denying that Wu Shu-chen had ever made a request for leave, and stating that it was a criminal ""statement of facts"" to the court, asking the court to accompany with professional medical personnel from NTU to understand whether Wu Shu-chen was suitable for appearing in court. As for Chen Shui-bian’s possible role as an assistant to Wu Shu-chen when she appears in court, pro-Chen people revealed that Chen and Wu are both defendants, and Chen Shui-bian is “inappropriate and unnecessary” to serve as Wu Shu-chen’s assistant. Although the flat office denied that Wu Shuzhen had asked the court for a leave of absence, Huang Junming, the administrative court chief of Taipei District Court, said that whether the defendant's filing was a leave of absence should be determined by the content; Wu Shuzhen stated that the content of the complaint had the meaning of a leave of absence. The legal community believes that the denial of Fu's leave by the Fu office is just a ruse to claim that it is only submitting a ""criminal statement"", but anyone who reads the content can see that it is a leave of absence. Why does the Fu office have to play word games. Su-Chen Wu appointed lawyer Seng-Hung Lee and Xue-Xing Liao to submit a statement to the court on the afternoon of June 16, stating that Wu Su-Chen had a fracture at the end of June and needed to be supported and elevated; she had a cold last month, which has not yet been cured, and in the past week, she fainted one or two times almost every day. The Taipei District Court said that the collegial panel decided to take a ten-minute break every half hour of the trial, and if necessary, Wu Shuzhen could lie on the hospital bed prepared in the court to testify, and there were medical equipment and professional medical staff of the National Taiwan University Hospital on standby in the court, Wu Shuzhen must appear in court to testify. It was also reported that, in order to facilitate the interrogation of Wu Shuzhen, the National Taiwan University Hospital was asked by the court to assign medical staff and emergency equipment to the hospital. But the medical personnel assigned to be on call in court have been avoiding it. It is understood that the emergency department of NTU can only arrange for one doctor and one nurse to be on standby at Taipei District Court today through coordination, and the emergency department has already carried out a tabletop exercise for Wu Shuzhen's possible condition. Chen Shui-bian's office said Wu Shu-chen did not request a leave of absence, and the confidential fee case will be tried again. Chen Shui-bian said Wu Shu-chen fainted twice recently."

张瑞希《妻子的诱惑》再演复仇女观众：很可怕本报讯(记者张晓禾)近来，韩国SBS每日剧《妻子的诱惑》显示出了惊人的潜力，不仅在韩国收视率一路攀升，在中国，也有众多网友每天守在网上看最快的更新。《妻子的诱惑》到底是用何种法宝将观众“诱惑”住的呢？温顺妻也有愤怒的一天这是关于一个传统的韩国女人被丈夫和好友背叛、几乎被害死，后来以另一个身份复仇的故事。女主角恩才(张瑞希饰)是一个温顺、善良的妻子，而她的丈夫早在他们结婚前就和她的好姐妹有染，婚后也一直在猎艳。恩才的好姐妹一直很妒忌恩才嫁到富有的家庭，在恩才结婚前就勾引了她的未婚夫，出国几年读书回国后，继续勾引她的丈夫，并在恩才怀孕后，还从国外接来一个小男孩说是和恩才的丈夫生的孩子，后来为了顺利和恩才丈夫结婚，逼着恩才离婚，还与恩才丈夫合谋把恩才害得掉下海，在以为恩才死了后，他们就快乐地结婚去了。恩才被救后孩子没了，也没有联系自己的亲人，在暗中看到她死后夫家婆婆、前夫和那个好友还是不断陷害、伤害她的家人，十分气愤，就决定以另一个身份出现，勾引自己的前夫，等前夫和那个女人分手后，再把他狠狠抛弃……人物性格极端是看点除剧情引人入胜外，极具极端性的人物角色也起到了调味料的作用。使尽浑身解数欺辱儿媳的婆婆(金宝拉饰)以及与婆婆一同干尽坏事的恩才的好姐妹申爱丽激起了观众的愤怒。当剧情发展到恩才落水后被健宇救起之时，观众一面暗骂恶夫郑焦彬与无恶不作的申爱丽，一面从善良的智障姑姑(吴英实饰)那儿寻找着安慰。“人鱼小姐”张瑞希的卖力表演同样是该剧的一大法宝。正是有了她的卖力演出，《妻子的诱惑》才得以成功地引起了观众的共鸣。3招让女人更受欢迎会打扮恩才化名闵素姬“重生”后上的第一节课便是着装打扮，在不断的模仿和学习中，她从一个略为土气的大脸姑娘变成人见人爱的惊艳女郎，容颜虽相似，气质却不同，所有人都识不破她的真正身份。该剧在韩国时装界引发“张瑞希效应”，她在剧中穿过的服饰被不少服装公司疯狂效仿。有内涵对“秀外慧中”一词，恩才理解最深。为了演好留学归来的闵素姬这一角色，恩才废寝忘食学习外语、游泳、高尔夫、跳舞、绘画、理财，焦彬自己都称：“以前女人接近我，我觉得都是为了钱，但是闵小姐你这么有钱，这么有才华，能看得上我，我真是三生有幸……”会撒娇恩才是个“不会撒娇”的女人，即便面对婆婆的百般刁难和丈夫的背叛，她也一声不吭。但化身闵素姬后，她在前夫面前，细语柔情地说话；跟情敌发生冲突时，只要焦彬一出现，她立刻装出受害者的可怜模样，激起焦彬的保护欲。网友不赞同恩才的复仇方式恩才在剧中由单纯善良的贤妻变成充满仇恨的复仇女子，180度的大转身让观众看得过瘾的同时，也为她感到心疼。观众李小姐就说：“虽然恩才之后变得更漂亮、更有内涵了，但却很可怕，我们再也看不到她以前的清纯可人了，她无时无刻都在盘算如何复仇，这样的人物在影视剧中出现可以，在现实生活中我们都不想看到。”观众张女士也表示：“我只爱恩才后来的外形和内涵，并不赞同她极端的复仇方式，她在复仇的同时其实也在伤害自己。”	张瑞希,张晓禾,恩才,金宝拉,申爱丽,郑焦彬,焦彬,吴英实,闵素姬,李小姐,张女士	正向	"Zhang Ruixi's ""Wife's Temptation"" Re-enactment Revenge Women Audience: Very scary. According to the reporter Zhang Xiaohuo, recently, the Korean SBS daily drama ""Wife's Temptation"" has shown amazing potential, not only in South Korea, the ratings are rising, but also in China, there are many netizens watching the fastest updates online every day. What kind of magic weapon does ""Wife's Temptation"" use to ""tempt"" the audience? Submissive Wives Have a Day of Anger is about a traditional Korean woman who is betrayed by her husband and friend, nearly killed, and later avenges herself under another identity. The leading lady, Nc-tae (played by Zhang Ruxi), is a gentle and kind wife, while her husband has been having affairs with her good friend since before their marriage, and has continued to seek new conquests after marriage. Her talented good sister has always been jealous of her marriage to a wealthy family. Before her marriage, she seduced her fiancé. After studying abroad for several years and returning home, she continued to seduce her husband. After she became pregnant, she even brought a little boy from abroad, saying that it was her husband's child. Later, in order to marry her husband smoothly, she forced her to divorce and conspired with her husband to harm her, making her fall into the sea. After they thought she was dead, they happily got married. After Nencai was saved, the child was lost, and she did not contact her relatives. She was very angry to see her in-laws, ex-husband, and that friend continue to harm her family in the dark after her death. She decided to appear as another identity, seduce her ex-husband, and abandon him after he broke up with that woman. The extreme personality of the characters is a highlight, in addition to the plot being captivating, it also played a role as seasoning. The grandmother (Kim Baek-ra), who exhausted all her skills to humiliate her daughter-in-law, and Shin Ae-ri, her good sister who did all kinds of evil things with her grandmother, have provoked the audience's anger. When the plot developed to the point where Nanche fell into the water and was rescued by Jianyu, the audience cursed the evil husband Zheng Jiaobin and the evil Shen Ailin on one hand, and sought comfort from the kind and mentally disabled aunt (played by Wu Yingshi) on the other. Zhang Ruxi's energetic performance as the mermaid princess is also a key ingredient of the play. It was her hard work that made ""Wives' Temptation"" resonate with the audience. 3 ways to make women more popular would dress up. Encai changed her name to Min Sujee. After ""rebirth"", the first lesson she took was dressing. Through continuous imitation and learning, she transformed from a slightly rustic girl with a big face into a stunning lady that everyone loved. Although her appearance was similar, her temperament was different. No one could recognize her true identity. The drama sparked a ""Chang Rui Xi effect"" in the Korean fashion industry, and many clothing companies imitated the costumes she wore in the drama crazily. Of all the words ""秀外慧中"", Nenchai has the deepest understanding. To play the role of Min Sushee, who returned from studying abroad, Encai studied foreign languages, swimming, golf, dancing, painting, and financial management so diligently that even Jiaobin himself said, ""Before, I thought that women who approached me were all for money, but Miss Min, you are so rich and talented, and you can look at me, I am really blessed in three lives and three deaths... "" Encai, who is not good at being spoiled, did not say a word even when her mother-in-law was extremely difficult and her husband betrayed her. But after she reincarnated as Min Sue-ki, she spoke softly and tenderly to her ex-husband; and when she had a conflict with her rival, she immediately put on a pitiful victim’s face as soon as Jiao Bin appeared, arousing his protective instinct. Netizens do not agree with Encai's way of revenge. In the drama, Encai, who was a simple and kind virtuous wife, turned into a woman full of hatred for revenge. The 180-degree turn made the audience feel satisfied while also feeling sorry for her. Miss Li, the audience, said, ""Although she has become more beautiful and more profound after the revenge, she is very scary. We can no longer see her former innocence.

内置显卡六款支持3D加速安卓手机推荐科技发达的今天，3D早已深入我们的生活。游戏玩家都喜欢自己电脑的3D功能强大，可以玩大型3D游戏。随着手机与平板电脑的硬件不断升级，掌上终端设备的性能越来越强大，部分手机处理3D任务早就不在话下，例如NvidiaTegra2这款CPU，内置了GeForceGPU，3D性能堪比老款PC。漫漫旅途，拿着手机坐在车里，玩一把效果绚丽的3D游戏。不仅对自己来说是一种享受，同时也能获得周围人羡慕的目光。到底哪些手机的处理器是支持3D加速功能的呢？下面就让我们来看看吧。推荐机型：LGOptimus2X(参数报价图片论坛软件)(P993)参考价格：2680元手机特色：外观帅气硬朗，性能霸气强悍简约时尚、帅气硬朗的LGP993，搭载了全球首款移动终端双核处理器NvidiaTegra2，性能是现有智能手机的10倍，作为全球第一款双核手机，引导手机进入双核时代。它的性能相当强大，集成NVIDIAGeForceGPU，可带来出色的移动3D游戏体验和快速响应的3D界面。LGP993采用直板造型，外形简洁时尚，拿在手里稍微有些大，很有分量感。虽然接口位置突兀，但整体感觉不错，机身顶部防尘盖上大大的HDMI字样，很是吸引人。同时，银色装饰条设计为机身背部增添了一番清新的感觉，不过银色装饰条不耐磨，容易留下划痕。一颗800万像素摄像头与LED闪光灯一齐位于机身上部。LGP993正面配有一块4.0英寸的电容触摸屏幕，400x800像素的分辨率，1600万色的色彩数趋于主流。显示非常出色，LGP993搭载了Android2.2的智能操作系统，配合LG的二次开发界面，具有滑动解锁功能、最多七分屏等实用功能，而且3D效果也非常明显，支持GSM/WCDMA的网络制式。LGP993使用了NvidiaTegra2双核处理器，主频高达1GHz，支持3D加速，运行大型3D游戏的时候，这款CPU的强劲得以完全体现。内存组合为8GBROM+512MBRAM，可以轻松的应对各种储存和程序安装，完全不必担心ROM不够使用。不过仅有1500mAh的电池应对双核CPU和4.0寸超大屏幕显得有些力不从心。编辑点评：这款手机帅气硬朗，屏幕分辨率也很高，显示效果亮丽，拍照效果出众，加上支持3D加速的双核芯片，支持1080P视频录制，无一不让它成为人们心目中的性感机神。但是RAM相对而言不是很大，日后升级的是很可能会受到些许影响，续航时间也让人头疼。		正向	Integrated graphics cards are recommended for six Android phones that support 3D acceleration. Today, 3D has deeply penetrated our lives. Game players all like the 3D function of their own computers to be powerful, so that they can play large 3D games. As the hardware of mobile phones and tablets is constantly upgraded, the performance of handheld terminal devices is getting stronger and stronger. Some mobile phones can handle 3D tasks without any problem, such as the Nvidia Tegra2 CPU, which is equipped with a GeForce GPU, and its 3D performance is comparable to that of old PCs. On a long journey, holding a mobile phone in the car, playing a splendid 3D game. Not only is it a pleasure for oneself, but it also attracts envy from those around. Which mobile phone processors support 3D acceleration? Let's take a look now. Recommended model: LG Optimus 2X (parameters, quotations, images, forum, software) (P993) Reference price: 2680 yuan Mobile features: handsome and rugged appearance, powerful and powerful performance Simple and fashionable, rugged LG P993, equipped with the world's first mobile terminal dual-core processor Nvidia Tegra2, the performance is 10 times that of existing smartphones. As the world's first dual-core phone, it leads the mobile phone into the dual-core era. It is quite powerful, integrating an NVIDIA GeForce GPU, which brings excellent mobile 3D gaming experience and fast 3D interface response. LGP993 has a straight shape, with a simple and fashionable appearance. It is a bit large in hand, with a strong sense of weight. Although the interface position is awkward, the overall feeling is not bad, and the big HDMI characters on the dust cover at the top of the body are very attractive. Meanwhile, the silver trim design adds a fresh touch to the back of the body, but the silver trim is not wear-resistant and is prone to scratches. An 8-megapixel camera and an LED flash are located on the upper part of the body. LGP993 has a 4.0-inch capacitive touch screen on the front, with a resolution of 400x800 pixels and a color depth of 16 million colors, which tends to be mainstream. The display is very good, LGP993 is equipped with Android 2.2 intelligent operating system, in combination with LG's secondary development interface, has the sliding unlock function, up to seven screen split, and practical functions, and the 3D effect is also very obvious, supports GSM/WCDMA network system. LGP993 uses a Nvidia Tegra2 dual-core processor with a high clock speed of 1GHz, supporting 3D acceleration. When running large 3D games, the power of this CPU is fully demonstrated. The memory combination is 8GB ROM + 512MB RAM, which can easily handle various storage and program installations, and there is no need to worry about ROM being insufficient. But the 1500mAh battery is a bit hard-pressed to cope with the dual-core CPU and 4.0-inch super-large screen. Editor's review: This mobile phone is handsome and rugged, with a high screen resolution and bright display effect, outstanding photography effect, and a dual-core chip that supports 3D acceleration, and supports 1080P video recording, which makes it a sexy machine god in people's hearts without exception. But the RAM is relatively small, and it is likely to be affected to some extent in the future when upgrading, and the battery life is also a headache.

巴基斯坦军方称冲突地区恢复平静需一年新华网巴基斯坦拉瓦尔品第6月6日电（记者李敬臣饶博）巴基斯坦军方发言人阿巴斯少将6日说，预计全部清除西北部冲突地区的武装分子，并使当地恢复平静还需要一年左右的时间。阿巴斯是当天在巴三军公关部总部举行的新闻发布会上回答提问时作上述表示的。他说，巴安全部队从4月底在西北部地区开始军事行动以来已经累计打死1305名武装分子，安全部队方面也有105人死亡。过去24小时里，安全部队继续在西北边境省多个地区展开行动，在斯瓦特河谷地区打死17名武装分子，安全部队方面有1人身亡。阿巴斯说，安全部队将继续在冲突地区驻扎。他说，目前安全部队还没有决定是否要前往南瓦济里斯坦部落地区打击武装分子，这将取决于政府的决定。阿巴斯还说，被取缔的宗教组织“执行先知穆罕默德法典运动”头目苏菲·穆罕默德并没有被捕。该组织4日曾向媒体宣称苏菲·穆罕默德被捕。巴基斯坦西北边境省政府今年2月与“执行先知穆罕默德法典运动”达成协议，同意一旦塔利班武装盘踞的斯瓦特河谷地区恢复和平，将在包括斯瓦特河谷地区在内的马拉根德区实行伊斯兰教法。该协议4月13日得到国民议会（下院）一致通过。但这一地区的塔利班武装拒绝放下武器并占领一些政府机构，袭击安全部队检查站。巴安全部队随后分别对迪尔、布内尔和斯瓦特地区发起军事行动，全面打击塔利班武装。	李敬臣,饶博,阿巴斯,斯瓦特,苏菲·穆罕默德,迪尔,布内尔	正向	"The Pakistani military said that it would take about a year to restore calm in the conflict area. Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, June 6 (Reporter Li Jingchen Rao Bo) - Pakistani military spokesman General Abbas said on June 6 that it would take about a year to completely clear the armed forces in the conflict area in the northwest and restore calm. Abbas made the above remarks at a press conference held at the headquarters of the PA's Public Relations Department on that day in response to questions. He said that the security forces had killed a total of 1,305 armed militants since the military operation began in the northwest region at the end of April, and that 105 security force members had also been killed. Over the last 24 hours, security forces continued to conduct operations in several areas of the northwest frontier province, killing 17 militants in the Swat valley, and one security force member was killed. Abbas said that security forces would continue to be stationed in the areas of conflict. He said that the security forces have not yet decided whether to go to South Waziristan to strike at the militants, which will depend on the government's decision. Abbas also said that the leader of the banned religious organization, Sufi Muhammad, who heads the ""Movement for the Implementation of the Prophet Muhammad's Code,"" was not arrested. The group had announced to the media that Sohaila Mohammed was arrested on April 4. In February this year, the government of the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan reached an agreement with the ""Movement for the Implementation of the Prophet Muhammad's Code"" to apply Islamic law in the Malakand district, including the Swat Valley, once the Swat Valley, which is currently occupied by Taliban militants, is restored to peace. The agreement was unanimously adopted by the National Assembly (lower house) on April 13. But the Taliban fighters in this region refused to lay down their arms and occupy some government institutions, and attacked security force checkpoints. The army then launched military operations in the Dir, Buner and Swat regions separately, targeting the Taliban militants comprehensively."
暴风影音“损失”千万清除低俗广告互联网企业甘愿自断广告财路？暴风影音CEO冯鑫近日表示，暴风影音将于今年元月开始进行广告物料净化检查，继续“去广告”行动，这项措施将导致暴风影音损失近千万元年收入。据悉，此次事件源起有网友借用暴风影音2011新年版左下角边框悬浮广告语——“15岁少女凹凸有致”，在微博留言给冯鑫，表示对暴风影音上的低俗广告的不满。网友留言两日后，冯鑫在微博上回应：“为彻底摆脱‘15岁少女凹凸有致’的讽刺以及给大家观赏不快感，我们终于决心在承受收入损失的前提下，做广告物料净化检查。这是暴风继去除播放窗体上按钮广告后，可能损失年收入千万级以上的第二次‘去广告’行动，2011年元月执行！”而冯鑫本人也在之后的采访中证实了微博中的内容。目前，国内视频网站在带宽、服务器上的烧钱速度过快，成本投入过高，导致即便是收入达到了亿元级别的一线视频网站也难以盈利，而广告收入则是视频网站实现盈亏平衡的重要渠道。这意味着，连续两次清除年利润千万级别的广告，对于暴风影音来说无异于是一种“自杀行为”。对此，业内人士表示，将冯鑫两次砍掉广告的举措与暴风影音力推高清视频放在一起来分析，这说明视频行业的竞争焦点已转移到了用户体验上。站在3亿左右视频网民的角度，视频行业会越来越注重体验的竞争。冯鑫下决心清除低俗广告，是其看重用户体验，拓展视频市场份额的长远投资。冯鑫曾经宣布暴风影音大约在2012年启动纳斯达克上市之旅，此番一系列连续塑造口碑的举措可以看成是暴风影音做好“长跑”的准备，也可以看成是在调整自身业务，运作更加健康的思路。冯鑫宣布清除低俗广告后，很多微博网友留言表示支持。而这种行为被肯定的背后更重要的因素是用户的感受被企业所尊重。商报记者张绪旺	冯鑫,张绪旺	正向	"The暴风影音 ""lost"" millions of clearing vulgar advertisements. Are Internet companies willing to cut off their own advertising revenue? Feng Xin, CEO of FengXin Video, recently said that FengXin Video will start to conduct a purification check of advertising materials in January this year, and continue the ""anti-ad"" action. This measure will cause FengXin Video to lose nearly 10 million yuan in annual revenue. It is reported that the incident originated from a netizen who used the floating advertisement slogan of the left bottom frame of暴风影音2011 New Year edition, ""15-year-old girl with a good figure"", to leave a message for Feng Xin on Weibo, expressing dissatisfaction with the vulgar advertisements on Feng Xing. Two days after a netizen's comment, Feng Xin responded on Weibo: ""In order to completely get rid of the ridicule of '15-year-old girl with a well-proportioned figure' and to avoid giving people an unpleasant viewing experience, we finally decided to do a purification check of the advertising materials under the premise of bearing the loss of income."" This is the暴风's second 'ad-free' action after removing the button ads on the playback window, which may result in a loss of tens of millions of yuan in annual revenue, to be carried out in January 2011! And Feng Xin himself later confirmed the content of the Weibo. Currently, domestic video websites are burning money at a fast pace on bandwidth and servers, with high cost inputs, leading to the fact that even first-tier video websites with revenue reaching the billion level are difficult to make a profit, and advertising revenue is an important channel for video websites to achieve break-even. This means that for暴风影音, continuously clearing millions of yuan in advertising profits twice in a row is akin to a ""suicide"" action. Industry insiders say that analyzing the two times Feng Xin cut off the advertisements together with the promotion of high-definition videos by Thunderbolt Video, it shows that the focus of competition in the video industry has shifted to the user experience. From the perspective of hundreds of millions of video users, the video industry will increasingly focus on competition in experience. Feng Xin is determined to clear out the vulgar advertisements, which is a long-term investment for him to value the user experience and expand the video market share. Feng Xin once announced that暴风影音 would start its Nasdaq listing journey around 2012. This series of consecutive reputation-building measures can be seen as preparations for a long run by Feng Xing, or as an adjustment of its own business to operate in a more healthy way. After Feng Xin announced the removal of low-quality advertisements, many microblog users left messages to express their support. And the more important factor behind the affirmation of such behavior is that the user's feelings are respected by the enterprise. Reporter Zhang Xuwang of Commercial News"
爵士vs湖人前瞻：科比重任在肩紫金军送人9连败新浪体育讯　北京时间4月5日消息，保罗-加索尔本赛季还没有休战过，如果他能够继续出战，那么洛杉矶湖人队(55胜21负)对犹他爵士队(36胜41负)的主场连胜应该可以延续。九连胜刚刚被终结的湖人队急需反弹，科比-布莱恩特和队友们不会放过主场赢球的任何机会。在输给掘金队后，湖人队结束九连胜，他们与西部领头羊马刺队的差距被拉开到两场半。不过与冲击西部头号种子相比，湖人队更看重的是球员健康，可坏事往往是一起上门。加索尔在第三节扣篮时被内内犯规，他的右膝被对手撞到，经过检查西班牙人右膝骨头挫伤，他能否出场要等到赛前确定。“实际上我的感觉要比昨天好了许多，这是一个不错的信号，我感觉不错。”加索尔对记者表示。加索尔自我感觉不错，但菲尔-杰克逊愿意冒险吗？毕竟湖人队是要争取总冠军的球队，一场常规赛的胜负并没有那么重要，因此“禅师”很可能会安排加索尔休息。安德鲁-拜纳姆在与掘金队交锋时也膝盖受伤，他的情况要好许多，明天应该可以出战。有了拜纳姆和拉玛尔-奥多姆的存在，湖人队内线就可以确保一定的竞争力，这也可能促使加索尔被安排休息。加索尔在内线的重要性不言而喻，如果他无法出场，其他内线必须要给予球队更多的帮助，而作为球队领袖的科比当仁不让要承担更多责任。湖人队还需要五场胜利达到60胜，此前杰克逊带领球队拿到60胜后都成功夺冠。“在场上总会有起伏，你不需要太在意人们的称赞和批评，”科比说道，“你只需要做好应该做的事情，发挥出最高的水平。”就象科比所说的，与爵士队交锋他们只需要打出自己的最高水平即刻。包括季后赛，湖人队在主场已连续17次击败爵士队，自从2006年1月2日起他们就没有在主场输给过爵士队。上周六做客盐湖城时，湖人队逆转最多17分落后战胜对手，他们有五人得分上双，明天他们同样需要进攻中能有多点开花的表现。爵士队近况糟糕，他们已经遭遇八连败，自2005年3月5日-20日后他们就没有过九连败，2004-05赛季是他们27年来唯一一个胜率不到五成的赛季。可输给国王队后，他们距离赛季胜率不足五成只差一场败仗。爵士队战绩不佳，伤病是一个原因，德文-哈里斯、安德烈-基里连科、拉加-贝尔都受到伤病困扰，这削弱了他们的实力。基里连科和贝尔恐怕无法在洛杉矶复出，哈里斯要取决于赛前的情况。不过在内线爵士队还有艾尔-杰弗森和保罗-米尔萨普，他们两人都有很强的冲击力，他们的发挥直接影响球队在洛杉矶的命运。预计双方首发阵容湖人队：费舍尔、科比、阿泰斯特、奥多姆、拜纳姆爵士队：沃特森、海沃德、迈尔斯、米尔萨普、杰弗森(Melody)	科比,保罗-加索尔,加索尔,科比-布莱恩特,内内,西班牙人,菲尔-杰克逊,杰克逊,禅师,安德鲁-拜纳姆,拜纳姆,拉玛尔-奥多姆,奥多姆,德文-哈里斯,哈里斯,安德烈-基里连科,基里连科,拉加-贝尔,贝尔,艾尔-杰弗森,杰弗森,保罗-米尔萨普,米尔萨普,费舍尔,阿泰斯特,沃特森,海沃德,迈尔斯	正向	"Jazz vs Lakers preview: Gasol carries the burden, Purple Gold Army sends 9 consecutive losses to the Lakers. Sina Sports News, on April 5, 2018, Paul Gasol has not rested this season. If he can continue to play, the home winning streak of Los Angeles Lakers (55 wins and 21 losses) against Utah Jazz (36 wins and 41 losses) should continue. The Lakers, who had just lost their nine-game winning streak, needed to bounce back, and Kobe Bryant and his teammates would not miss the opportunity to win at home. Following their loss to the Nuggets, the Lakers ended their nine-game winning streak, and the gap between them and the Western Conference leaders, the Spurs, widened to two and a half games. But while the Lakers were more concerned with player health than with the challenge of facing the top seed in the West, bad luck often comes in threes. Gasol was fouled by Nene while dunking in the third quarter, and his right knee was hit by the opponent. After the check, the Spaniard's right knee suffered a bone contusion. Whether he can play will be determined before the game. Actually, my feeling is much better than yesterday, which is a good signal, and I feel good. ""Gasol told the press."" Gasol feels good, but is Phil Jackson willing to take a chance? After all, the Lakers are a championship team, and the result of a regular season game is not so important, so ""the Sage"" is likely to arrange for Gasol to rest. Andrew Bynum also suffered a knee injury against the Nuggets, but his condition is much better, and he should be able to play tomorrow. With Bynum and Lamar Odom in the lineup, the Lakers' frontcourt can ensure a certain level of competitiveness, which may also prompt Gasol to be rested. The importance of Gasol in the paint is beyond doubt, and if he cannot take the court, other big men must provide more help to the team. As the team leader, Kobe naturally shouldered more responsibility. The Lakers still need five more wins to reach 60, and Jackson's teams have all won the championship after reaching 60 wins before. ""There will always be ups and downs on the court, you don't need to pay too much attention to people's praise and criticism,"" said Kobe. ""You just need to do what you should do and play at your best level."" As Kobe said, they only need to play to their highest level against the Jazz. The Lakers have won 17 consecutive games against the Jazz at home, including the playoffs, and they have not lost to the Jazz at home since January 2, 2006. Last Saturday, when the Lakers visited Salt Lake City, they overcame a 17-point deficit to defeat their opponents. Five players scored in double digits, and they will need to have multiple scorers in their attack tomorrow. The Jazz's recent performance has been terrible, they have suffered eight consecutive losses, and they have not had nine consecutive losses since March 5-20, 2005. The 2004-05 season was the only season in the past 27 years when their winning rate was less than 50%. After they lost one game, they were only one game away from a sub-.500 record when they received the King's team. The Jazz have had a poor record, and injuries are one of the reasons. Devin Harris, Andrei Kirilenko, and Rajon Rondo have all been troubled by injuries, which have weakened their strength. Kirilenko and Barea may not be able to return to Los Angeles, and Harris will depend on the situation before the game. But inside, the Jazz have Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap, both of whom are strong inside players, and their performance will directly affect the team’s fate in Los Angeles. The expected starting lineups are as follows: Lakers: Fisher, Kobe, Artest, Duhon, Bynum; Jazz: Watson, Hayward, Miles,米尔萨普,Jefferson(Melody)"

周二A股市场继续上扬沪指收复3200今日投资周二A股市场继续上扬，沪指收复3200点。上证指数收于3235.36点，涨1.25%；深圳成指收于13682.2点，涨1.45%。两市A股共有1520只股票上涨，73只股票下跌。成交金额有所放大，上海市场从上一交易日的1638亿升至1947亿元；深圳市场从1071亿元增加到1223亿元。受芝加哥采购经理人指数好于预期以及金融股上涨带动，美股周一小幅上扬。11月芝加哥采购经理人指数从10月的54.2上升至56.1,高于53.0的市场预期。道指与标准普尔500指数本月均上涨了5%以上，创自7月以来最大单月涨幅。2009年11月，全国制造业采购经理指数(PMI)为55.2%，与上月持平。该指数已连续九个月位于临界点50%以上，表明制造业经济总体保持平稳回升态势。这显示出在一系列“保增长”的宏观调控政策作用下，当前中国经济已基本熨平由国际金融危机带来的异常波动。在未来一段时期之内，政府投资的力度将逐步趋于平缓，经济增长将逐步由政府投资主导的复苏向市场自我良性复苏进行转变，因此短期内，经济可能缺乏进一步提升的动力，而呈现出持续稳步回升的态势。在前期一系列宏观经济调控措施的作用下，经济增长正在朝着企稳向好的方向发展，对未来中国经济的增长仍然保持乐观的预期。大盘蓝筹弱于中小市值股票，中国石化涨0.08%，中国石油涨0.22%，中国平安涨0.48%。国家医保目录正式发布，医药板块全线上扬，康缘药业涨6.47%。中央财政将投入900多亿用于污水行业，环保类股票则延续强势表现，菲达环保涨停。海南的国际旅游岛建设引起中央媒体的广泛关注，海南国际旅游岛获批在即，海南板块开始走强，罗顿发展涨5.43%。产品价格上涨空间大的行业近期走势强劲，包括钢铁、水泥、部分化工产品等，宝钢股份涨7.83%，冀东水泥涨6.15%。另外，造纸、家具和纺织机械等板块居涨幅前列，船舶制造、金融和传媒娱乐等板块相对较弱。市场快速调整后传言很多，虽然每个消息都没得到证实和证伪，也无法解释市场下跌时板块联动关系，但是却成为理解市场调整的理由。同时机构的担忧情绪也在增强，担忧是否会像8月份下跌那样引发连锁反应。从多数机构的观点来看，他们认为市场不会像8月份下跌一样引起连锁反应，并基本认可目前A股市场调整的幅度已经基本到位。虽然在中央经济工作会议召开之前，市场对政策的担心会仍然存在，短期市场还将呈现震荡格局。待宏观政策调控思路进一步明朗后，市场有望再现升势，股指中枢震荡上行是大趋势。		正向	"The A-share market continued to rise on Tuesday, with the Shangzheng Index recovering above 3200 points.

Driven by the better-than-expected Chicago purchasing managers' index and the rise of financial stocks, US stocks edged up slightly on Monday. The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.1 in November from 54.2 in October, above market expectations of 53.0. The Dow and the S&P 500 both rose by more than 5% for the month, the biggest one-month gain since July. In November 2009, the national manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 55.2%, unchanged from the previous month. The index has been above the critical point of 50% for nine consecutive months, indicating that the manufacturing economy as a whole has maintained a steady recovery. This shows that, under a series of ""pro-growth"" macro-control policies, the current Chinese economy has basically smoothed out the abnormal fluctuations caused by the international financial crisis.

The national medical insurance directory was officially released, and the pharmaceutical sector rose across the board, with Kangyuan Pharmaceutical up 6.47%. More than 90 billion yuan of central government funds will be invested in the sewage industry, and environmental protection stocks continued to perform strongly, with Feida Environmental Protection hitting the daily limit. Construction of the international tourism island of Hainan has attracted the close attention of central media. Hainan International Tourism Island is about to be approved, and the Hainan block has started to strengthen. Luotong Development rose 5.43%. Industries with large room for price increases in product prices have recently performed strongly, including steel, cement, and some chemical products, with Baosteel Corporation up 7.83% and Jidong Cement up 6.15%. Additionally, the papermaking, furniture, and textile machinery sectors were among the top performers, while shipbuilding, finance, and media and entertainment sectors were relatively weaker. After the market quickly adjusted, there were many rumors, although each message was not confirmed or refuted, and could not explain the联动relationship of the sector during the market decline, but it became the reason for understanding the market adjustment. At the same time, institutions are also becoming more concerned that a chain reaction may be triggered, similar to the decline in August. From the perspective of most institutions, they believe that the market will not trigger a chain reaction like in August, and basically recognize that the adjustment of the A-share market has basically reached the right level. Although market concerns about policy will still exist before the Central Economic Work Conference, the market in the short term will still show an oscillating pattern. After the macro-control thinking is further clarified, the market is expected to resume its upward trend, and the stock index will oscillate upward in the long term."

阿巴斯呼吁以色列对加沙地带军事行动不要升级新华网拉姆安拉12月22日电(记者赵悦杨媛媛)巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯22日对以色列近来连续轰炸加沙地带的做法发出警告，呼吁以对加沙地带的军事行动不要升级。阿巴斯是在会见欧盟驻巴勒斯坦地区代表克里斯蒂安·贝尔热时作上述表示的。他说，以色列对加沙地带采取任何新的军事行动都会对和平进程造成严重影响，将导致国际社会为巴以和平所付出的努力遭受失败。阿巴斯向欧盟代表介绍了以色列拒绝在被占领土上停建犹太人定居点后巴以局势的最新发展，并呼吁欧盟在巴以和平进程中发挥更多作用。近日，以色列派遣战机及坦克轰炸加沙地带的军事行动增多，主要打击控制着加沙地带的巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动(哈马斯)的军事据点等目标。在从20日深夜至21日晚不到24小时的时间内，以色列战机共对加沙地带发动10次轰炸，造成6名巴勒斯坦人受伤。以军方称，这是对加沙地带武装人员向以色列发射火箭弹的回应。近来，以军与加沙地带武装人员冲突频发。据以色列军方统计，今年双方已发生约100起冲突，包括双方交火、发射火箭弹和定点空袭等。2008年12月27日至2009年1月18日，以色列以阻止加沙地带武装人员向以发射火箭弹为由，对加沙地带发动了代号为“铸铅行动”的大规模军事打击，造成1400多名巴勒斯坦人丧生、5500多人受伤。	阿巴斯,赵悦,杨媛媛,克里斯蒂安·贝尔热	正向	Abbas calls on Israel not to escalate military action in Gaza Xinhua News Agency, Ramallah, December 22 (Reporter Zhao Yue, Yang Yuanyuan) Palestinian President Abbas warned Israel on December 22 of the continuous bombing of Gaza Strip in recent days, and called on Israel not to escalate its military action in Gaza Strip. Abbas made the above remarks during a meeting with Christian Bérenguer, the EU representative in the Palestinian territories. He said that any new military action by Israel against the Gaza Strip would have a serious impact on the peace process and would lead to the failure of the international community's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abbas introduced the latest developments in the Israeli-Palestinian situation after Israel refused to stop building Jewish settlements on occupied territories to the EU representatives and called on the EU to play a greater role in the peace process between the two parties. Recently, Israel has increased the number of airstrikes and tank attacks on military operations in the Gaza Strip, mainly targeting military positions of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) controlling the Gaza Strip. In less than 24 hours from late night of the 20th to the evening of the 21st, Israeli warplanes launched 10 bombing raids on the Gaza Strip, injuring six Palestinians. According to the military, this is a response to the rocket launch by the armed personnel in Gaza to Israel. Recently, there have been frequent clashes between the Israeli army and armed personnel in Gaza. According to the Israeli military, there have been about 100 clashes between the two sides this year, including crossfire, rocket launches, and定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭定点空袭 From December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009, Israel launched a large-scale military attack on the Gaza Strip under the pretext of preventing armed groups in Gaza from firing rockets at Israel, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,400 Palestinians and injuries to more than 5,500 people.

《肉中刺》重庆热拍斯琴高娃宋春丽破不和传闻本报讯(记者刘咏戈)近日，由俞钟执导，孙逊、斯琴高娃、宋春丽等人主演的谍战戏《肉中刺》在重庆拍摄。昨日，记者驱车来到剧组拍摄地渝北龙兴古镇，斯琴高娃正在拍摄来渝后的第一场戏，正是与宋春丽的对手戏。之前传闻两人在拍摄电视剧《娘》后闹翻，甚至一度拒绝同台演出。但昨日面对记者，两人不仅分吃零食还亲密地探讨剧本，大秀姐妹情。斯琴高娃打封闭拍戏斯琴高娃在剧中饰演国民党一位高官的母亲，身份尊崇，因有亲共行为而遭到保密局特务的暗杀。而宋春丽则饰演斯琴高娃的好姐妹，身份是地下党的副书记。记者在现场看到，两人的戏份是边包饺子边闲话家常，有亲戚带人来看家里的古董。但就这一场戏反复拍了一下午，刚刚赶到重庆的斯琴高娃明显很疲惫，在拍摄间歇还拿出一个药箱，倒出好几种药服用，斯琴高娃苦笑着告诉记者，她是打着封闭坚持演戏的：“我腿脚不好是老毛病了，这几天还感冒了，嗓子也不好。来的时候刚打的封闭，针头直接打进肘部骨头了，否则根本不能坚持。”一旁的宋春丽则关切地拿出一袋话梅，“吃吃这个吧，提神还润喉。”于是两人一边同吃话梅一边聊起了各自身体状况。不是姐妹胜似姐妹之前《娘》剧热播荧屏的时候，曾有媒体披露两大主演宋春丽跟斯琴高娃严重不和，甚至在参加某档节目录制时拒绝同台。宋春丽曾对此作出过澄清，但斯琴高娃从未对此做出回应。昨日再次同场飚戏，斯琴高娃坦言很过瘾：“我不想回应那些无聊的报道，越说越错，你们也看到了，我们没有什么飙不飙戏，一切都很自然。在戏外，我们无话不谈，都这把年纪了，我们都很珍惜彼此的感情。要说我们不和的，请他来现场看看。”言罢，斯琴高娃拿着剧本与宋春丽探讨起来，期间有说有笑。	斯琴高娃,宋春丽,刘咏戈,俞钟,孙逊	正向	"The Spies in the Meat, a spy drama starring Sichen Gao and Song Chunli, is being filmed in Chongqing. According to a report by Liu Yongge, director Yu Zhong, Sun Sun, Sichen Gao, Song Chunli and others are starring in the drama. Yesterday, the reporter drove to the shooting site of Longxing Ancient Town in Yubei, where Siqin Gaowa was shooting the first scene after arriving in Chongqing, which was the opposite scene with Song Chunli. It was rumored that the two had fallen out after filming the TV drama ""Mother"", and even refused to appear on the same stage. But yesterday, the two not only shared snacks but also had a close discussion about the script, showing off their sisterly affection to the reporters. Siqin Gaowa had a closed anesthesia while shooting. Siqin Gaowa played the mother of a high official of the Nationalist Party in the drama, with a high status, and was assassinated by secret service agents of the保密局 because of her pro-Communist behavior. Song Chunli, on the other hand, played Sishen Gao娃's good sister, whose identity was the deputy secretary of the underground party. The reporter saw the two actors chatting and making dumplings, with a relative bringing people to see the family's antiques. But the scene was shot for the whole afternoon. As she had just arrived in Chongqing, Siqin Gaowa looked very tired. She took out a medicine box and took several kinds of medicine during the shooting break. Siqin Gaowa smiled bitterly and told the reporter that she was shooting the play with a closed leg: ""My legs and feet are not good, which is an old problem. I have a cold these days, and my throat is not good."" When I came, I just got a block, and the needle was directly inserted into the bone of the elbow, otherwise I couldn't have lasted. On the side, Song Chunli took out a bag of hawthorns with concern, ""Eat this, it can invigorate and moisten the throat."" Then the two of them talked about their own health conditions while eating话梅 together. Before the hit drama ""Mother"" was broadcast on TV, the media once revealed that the two main actors, Song Chunli and Sichen Gao, had a serious falling out, and even refused to appear on the same stage when they participated in the recording of a certain program. Song Chunli once clarified this, but neither did Sicheng Gaoova. Yesterday, she admitted that it was very enjoyable to act on the same stage again: ""I don't want to respond to those boring reports. The more I say, the more wrong I am. You can see that we have nothing to compete in acting, everything is very natural."" Off stage, we have no secrets from each other. At our age, we cherish our feelings for each other very much. Let him come to the scene if he thinks we are not on good terms. Afterwards, Siqin Gaowa held the script and discussed with Song Chunli, who talked and laughed during the process."

网通固话用户半年流失149万本地通话费收入90.72亿元，同比降11.8%本报讯(记者赵谨)昨天，中国网通(00906.HK)在香港公布上半年业绩。财报显示，今年上半年网通总营收411.25亿元，其中包括初装费摊销收入5.05亿元，同比下降0.15%。同时，上半年网通净利润则达到58.77亿元，与2007年同期相比增长11.9%，网通表示这主要受到税率变化与非现金交易收益等因素的影响。2008年上半年网通的传统固话业务受到严峻挑战，尤其是本地固定电话用户持续流失，收入持续下滑。截至6月30日，网通的本地电话用户数为1.08亿户，比2007年年末减少231万户，其中，固定电话减少149万户，小灵通减少81.1万户。受此影响，网通上半年本地通话费收入90.72亿元，同比下跌11.8%；电话月租费收入51.32亿元，同比下跌23.4%；国内长途通话费收入39.45亿元，同比下跌11.8%；增值服务收入29.93亿元，略跌1.38%；网间结算收入39.51亿元，同比下跌6%。同时今年上半年，网通资本支出75.27亿元，同比下降10.7%，其中固话与小灵通投资比仅占4.4%，同比降13.2个百分点。在固网语音业务大幅萎缩之际，网通公告中称，大力拓展宽带为代表的创新型业务，宽带服务收入增38.8%至88.59亿元，占总收入的21.8%，较去年同期提高6.1个百分点。截至6月30日，网通宽带用户总数达到2336万户，高于上年同期的1712万户，截至7月底的宽带用户数量增至2398万户。网通CFO李福申表示，公司计划在2008年至2010年期间每年新增宽带用户800万户。-相关新闻联通中期净利润同比翻倍本报讯(记者赵谨)昨天，中国联通(00762.HK)公布2008年中期业绩，联通净利润为44.19亿元，比去年同期的21.77亿元增长1.03倍，每股盈利0.324元，营业额增长4%至351.35亿元。由于联通今年拟出售CDMA业务，因此将其列为终止经营业务，CDMA业务上半年盈利为6.5亿元。	赵谨,李福申	正向	China Telecom's fixed-line users lost 1.49 million in the first half of the year, and the local call revenue was 9.072 billion yuan, down 11.8% year on year. According to a report by Zhao Jin, a reporter, China Telecom (00906.HK) announced its first half of the year performance in Hong Kong yesterday. The financial report shows that the total revenue of China Telecom in the first half of this year was 41.125 billion yuan, including 505 million yuan of amortization income of initial installation fees, down 0.15% year-on-year. Meanwhile, China Netcom's net profit for the first half of the year reached 5.877 billion yuan, up 11.9% from the same period in 2007. China Netcom said that the main reason for the increase was the change in tax rates and the non-cash transaction gains. ChinaNet's traditional fixed-line business faced severe challenges in the first half of 2008, especially as local fixed-line telephone users continued to decline and revenue continued to fall. By June 30, China Netcom had 108 million local telephone subscribers, a decrease of 2.31 million from the end of 2007, of which, fixed telephones decreased by 1.49 million and Little Smart decreased by 811,000. Affected by this, the local call charges of China Telecom in the first half of the year were 9.072 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 11.8%; the telephone monthly rental fee was 5.132 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 23.4%; the domestic long-distance call charges were 3.945 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 11.8%; the value-added service income was 2.993 billion yuan, a slight decrease of 1.38%; the inter-network settlement income was 3.951 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 6%. Meanwhile, China Telecom's capital expenditure in the first half of this year was 7.527 billion yuan, down 10.7% year-on-year, with fixed telephones and Little Smart investment accounting for only 4.4% of the total, down 13.2 percentage points year-on-year. While fixed-line voice services were in sharp decline, ChinaNet announced that it had vigorously expanded innovative services such as broadband, with broadband service revenue increasing by 38.8% to 8.859 billion yuan, accounting for 21.8% of total revenue, up 6.1 percentage points from the same period last year. As of June 30, the total number of ChinaNet broadband users reached 23.36 million, up from 17.12 million in the same period last year, and the number of broadband users increased to 23.98 million by the end of July. Li Fushen, the CFO of China Telecom, said that the company plans to add 8 million broadband users every year from 2008 to 2010. -Related news China Unicom's net profit doubles in the first half of the year. According to a report by Zhao Jin, China Unicom (00762.HK) announced its 2008 first half financial results yesterday. China Unicom's net profit was 4.419 billion yuan, an increase of 1.03 times compared with 2.177 billion yuan in the same period last year. The earnings per share were 0.324 yuan, and the turnover increased by 4% to 35.135 billion yuan. As China Unicom plans to sell its CDMA business this year, it is listed as discontinued operations, and the CDMA business made a profit of 650 million yuan in the first half of the year.

As of the close of yesterday's trading, the CSI of both markets had risen by more than 1%, and all trading funds, except for two closed-end funds, had risen. RuiFude进取 ended its upward trend in the past few trading days, falling by 0.57%, while Tongqing B led all ETFs.

In addition to Ruifu Progress, Hanxing Fund also fell by 0.09%. Two more FOFs closed flat, namely, FOF Tianfeng and Tongqing A. Tongqing B rose by 2.94% on a single day, leading the way. 长城证券 warns investors that although they can be cautiously bullish on the operational strategy, the current discount rate of closed-end funds is already at a historical low, and they also need to guard against the consequences of a reversal of the market trend. Of course, for long-term investors, LOF, as a type of investment with relatively stable style, can still be held in the long-term expectation of market improvement. LOF funds: 29 funds that opened for trading all rose. Among them, Penghua Power has the largest increase, up 2.45%. In addition, the funds with the largest increases were Huaxia Blue Chip and Jingxin Resources, with increases of 2.43% and 2.19%, respectively.

专家支招：自考常见题型的答题方法四、几种常见题型的答题方法1、单项选择题：如果能很快地、准确地把正确答案找出来最好，如果没有把握，就应采用排除法，即应从排除最明显的错误备选项开始，把接近正确答案的备选项留下，再分析比较剩下的备选项，进一步逐一否定，最终选定正确答案。其实，许多单项选择题的4个备选项中，除1个正确外，其余3个并非完全错误，只是不符合此题目的要求而已，有的备选项是命题者从其他章节中移植过来作为干扰项。看一下题目顺序，再回忆对照教材的顺序，就能作出正确选择。2、多项选择题：许多多项选择题往往出自于某一基本问题，命题者把该问题的几个要点作为正确选项。干扰项当中，有的干扰项一看就知道是错误的，则立即排除，而有的干扰项是无法一下判定对错的，甚至其本身就没错，只是被放错了位置，同单项选择题一样，看命题和教材顺序选择，依然有效。另外，选中后，一定要按照字母A、B等备选项顺序书写。3、名词解释：答案要简练、概括、准确，只要理解了。用自己的话去解释也可以，不必拘泥于原文。如答不上，则顾名思义，根据题目去猜想、解释其义。4、简答题：要努力地搜索记忆中的答案要点，作答时，答案要有层次性，要突出要点并且工整地写在试卷上，语言要做到简洁明了。不管想出了几点，作答时一定要分段，切忌把几个要点写在一个自然段之中。5、论述题：列出答案要点，然后对要点逐一展开叙述，把自己的能力全部发挥出来，要在深度上和广度上努力，内容多多益善。必要时，可以先在草稿纸上列出答案要点，思考一下，看能阐述多少。如果时间紧张，那就直接把几个要点作答在试卷上（注意分段并留一定空白以备叙述），然后发挥形象思维能力，千万不要怕胡思乱想，尽可能地对要点进行展开叙述。坚决做到在答案要点的基础之上多些内容。五、弥补1、选择题的弥补。单项选择题当中如果还有几个怎么也做不出的话，干脆孤注一掷，统一选择一个备选项，即统一选择或A、或B、或C、或D.一般来讲，找回一分没问题，运气好的话，有时会找回更多分。多项选择题难度就大多了，实在想不出的话，ABCDE全部都选上，效果如何，就看运气了。2、非选择题的弥补。对每一道选择题的题目及答案（包括不正确的选项）和已经做好的其他非选择题的题目及答案进行反复阅读，有时会一下猛然醒悟而反应过来。如果还是不行，那就只有编写一些答案要点写上，但编写的东西必须是所考课程的内容，而不要张冠李戴，并从宏观角度出发（即下大包围）去阐述，尽量做到自圆其说。六、休息考完一科后，找地方去休息吧，千万不要参加考生之间的议论或互相对答案，也不要自己看书对答案。考过的已经过去，再想都无用，应抓紧时间清醒头脑，此时，越放松越好，这实际上是为考好下一科做的精神准备。七、小结以上技巧有五、六个大点及17、8个小点，考生朋友如果都运用得好，即每一点均能够“意外”地至少多得1分的话，合计起来就是20分左右，效果是不言而喻的。结语。千技巧万技巧，最根本的技巧还是努力地学习知识、掌握知识。综合笔者多年的自考经验，最有效的技巧是做到以下几点：1、熟悉大纲。《考试大纲》是学习和考核的依据，对课程的知识点、考核要求、难易程度、考试题型等作了规定。推荐——全国高等教育自学考试委员会颁布的《考试大纲》。2、钻研教材。教材是《考试大纲》所规定课程知识的具体化和系统阐述，考题均出自教材。推荐——全国高等教育自学考试委员会指定的教材。3、借助辅导用书。辅导用书是帮助消化、理解大纲和教材的老师。建议选用不仅能帮助顺利通过自考，还能够提高思维能力、记忆能力等综合能力的辅导用书。推荐——《自考专科公共课图表速记》和《自考本科公共课图表速记》（四川人民出版社出版）4、掌握学习方法。良好的学习方法能达到事半功倍的效果。推荐——《自考方法谈》（在www.zikao211.com搜索）。5、运用考试技巧。推荐——本文。考生朋友做好以上几点，一定能够做到一次过关。更多信息请访问：新浪自考频道自考论坛自考博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。		正向	"Expert advice: Four methods for answering common self-study questions. 2. Several methods for answering common types of questions. 1. Single choice questions: It is best to find the correct answer quickly and accurately. If you are not sure, you should use the elimination method, that is, you should start by eliminating the most obvious incorrect options, leaving the options that are close to the correct answer, and then analyze and compare the remaining options, further eliminating one by one, and finally selecting the correct answer. In fact, in the four options of many single-choice questions, except for one correct one, the other three are not completely wrong, but just do not meet the requirements of this question. Some options are transplanted from other chapters by the question setter as distractors. Check the order of the questions and then recall the order in the textbook to make the right choice. 2. Multiple Choice Questions: Many multiple choice questions are based on a single basic question, and the examiners list several key points of the question as the correct options. Among the distractors, some distractors are obviously wrong and can be excluded immediately, while some distractors cannot be judged right or wrong at a glance, and even they are not wrong, but just placed in the wrong position. Just like in single-choice questions, choose according to the order of the proposition and the textbook, which is still effective. Moreover, after selecting, you must write in the order of the options A, B, etc. 3. Explanation of nouns: The answer should be concise, comprehensive, and accurate. As long as you understand it. You can explain it in your own words, without being bound by the original text. If you can't answer, then by the name, guess and explain its meaning according to the question. 4. For the short-answer questions, try to search for the key points in your memory. When answering, the answers should have a hierarchical structure, highlight the key points, and write them neatly on the answer sheet. The language should be concise and clear. No matter how many points you come up with, you must divide them into paragraphs when answering, and avoid writing several key points in a single natural paragraph. 5. Essay: List the key points, then expand on each point one by one, fully demonstrating your abilities. Try to make the content as rich as possible in both depth and breadth. If necessary, you can first list the key points of the answer on the draft paper and think about how many you can elaborate on. If the time is tight, just answer the key points on the test paper (note to segment and leave some blank space to prepare for narration), and then use your imagination, don't be afraid of random thoughts, and try to expand the narration of the key points as much as possible. Make sure to add more content based on the key points of the answer. Five, make up for 1, make up for the fill-in-the-blank questions. If there are still several questions that you can't do in the single choice questions, you may as well take a chance and choose one option uniformly, that is, choose A, B, C, or D. Generally speaking, it is not a problem to get one point back, and sometimes you can get more points with good luck. Multiple-choice questions are much more difficult. If you can't think of anything, select ABCDE for all of them. How it works depends on your luck. 2. Make-up for non-choice questions. Read the questions and answers of each choice item (including the incorrect options) and the questions and answers of the other non-choice items that have been completed repeatedly. Sometimes you will suddenly realize it. If that still does not work, you can only write some key points of the answers, but the written content must be the content of the course being examined, and do not put the cart before the horse, and start from a macro perspective (i.e., broad coverage) to explain, and try to make it self-consistent. Six, after finishing one subject, find a place to rest. Don't participate in discussions among candidates or compare answers with each other, and don't check your answers by reading books yourself. What has been tested is in the past, and it is useless to think about it. We should seize the time to clear our minds. At this moment, the more relaxed we are, the better. In fact, this is a mental preparation for the next test. Seven, the above techniques have five or six major points and 17 or 8 minor points. If candidates can use all of them well, that is, each point can get at least one more point ""unexpectedly"", the total will be about 20 points, and the effect is self-evident. Conclusion. A thousand techniques and myriad techniques, the most fundamental technique is still to study hard and master knowledge. Based on the author's many years of experience in self-study, the most effective techniques are to do the following: 1. Familiarize yourself with the outline. The Syllabus is the basis for learning and assessment, and it makes provisions for the knowledge points, assessment requirements, degree of difficulty, types of examination questions, etc. of the course. Recommended - The Examination Outline promulgated by the National Higher Education Self-study Examination Committee. 2. Study the textbooks. Textbooks are the specific elaboration and systematic exposition of the course knowledge stipulated in the Examination Outline, and all the questions are derived from the textbooks. Recommended - Textbook designated by the National Higher Education Self-study Examination Committee. 3. Use study guides. The tutor book is a teacher to help digest, understand the outline and textbook. It is recommended to choose a study guide that not only helps to pass the self-study examination smoothly, but also improves comprehensive abilities such as thinking and memory. Recommended: ""Quick Memorization of Charts for General Courses of Self-study College Entrance Examination"" and ""Quick Memorization of Charts for General Courses of Self-study Bachelor's Degree"" (published by Sichuan People's Publishing House). 4. Master the learning methods. Good learning methods can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Recommended - ""Talk on the Methods of Self-study"" (search on www.zikao211.com). 5. Use test-taking skills. Recommended——this article. With the above points done well, you will definitely pass the exam in one go. For more information, please visit the Sina Self-study Channel, Self-study Forum, and Self-study Blog Circle. Special Note: Due to the continuous adjustment and change in various aspects, all the examination information provided by Sina.com is for reference only, and candidates are advised to refer to the officially announced information by the competent authority."

用友伟库网创新思维SaaS应用步入快车道7月8日，用友在线正式宣布激活伟库网(www.wecoo.com)，用作新的SaaS业务运营平台，以新平台、新技术、新模式、新应用为主要特点，专注于打造企业的贴心“好管家”。有评论认为，厚积薄发的用友SaaS一举树立了在业界的比较优势。10日在宁波，国内规模最大、最权威的第二届中国软件运营服务大会——“2008SaaS在中国”隆重举行，100多家软件提供商、互联网公司、电信和增值业务提供商，以及200多家企业用户参加了此次盛会。用友软件携伟库网独揽“中小企业类”产品创新大奖，并被评价为“最有潜力SaaS厂商”。“2008SaaS在中国”——第二届软件运营服务大会主题定位于“SaaS应用切入与创新”，这与用友一贯坚持的理念不谋而合。“获得中小企业类的创新奖，表明业界对用友的市场定位、客户需求理解及不断探索新产品的战略高度高度认可”。一位参会的专业人士对此表示。随着伟库网的正式运行，用友以“草根思维”创新SaaS理念，从中小企业切入，以不断创新的产品服务于企业管理与商务。“力做亚洲SaaS市场的领头羊”，用友软件高级副总裁兼在线事业部总经理杨祉雄信心满怀。“草根思维”创新SaaS服务理念2008年初，用友SaaS尚在研发阶段，就提出了“服务于中小型企业”的定位。和行业的竞争对手相比，在SaaS业务运作上，用友的起步似乎略显晚了一点。早在两年前，已有企业高调地宣称推出SaaS服务；市场方面，关于SaaS的相关话题及舆论炒作也相继而来。然而直到今天，目前国内尚没有任何一家公司在SaaS业务上获得切切实实、具有足够说服力的成绩。计世资讯的一位专家对这个新兴市场做了一番解读：有的产品只定位于电子商务，有的集中于财会，而对于有着4200万中小型企业市场的管理软件产品，却很缺乏。正是基于这点，用友在经过前期的充分市场调研，后期历时一年的研发，在“沉寂”了两年后提出了“草根思维”的客户定位策略。“用友SaaS锁定入门级用户，服务最为广泛的草根企业。”杨祉雄说：这些大多是50人以下，营业额在1000万元以下，业务经营相对单一，管理较为简单，大多是初创型公司。对于目标市场的清晰界定，这一创新理念体现了用友在SaaS领域独具慧眼。“创新不一定就是在业内第一个敢于尝试进军新的领域，提出更为先进、有效的理念或服务形式，更能体现其创新的核心价值所在。”计世咨讯的这位专家表示，从软件在线运营的产业视角来看，用友的积淀具有相当的竞争优势，这也让诸多专家纷纷看好用友SaaS。不难看出用友在SaaS业务运作上的深思熟虑。一方面，几乎所有的SaaS厂商都将目标用户锁定在中小企业，但是对于草根企业的关注并不多，用友恰恰在竞争激烈的SaaS市场找到了一片蓝海，而这个领域又如此之大，足以对用友的SaaS业务形成有力的支撑。受到服务成本、需求成熟度等因素的影响，50人以下的小型企业用户往往被传统管理软件厂商视为“非经济客户”、成为管理软件“市场中的长尾”。基于对企业管理特征和需求的把握，用友对不同规模的客户进行细分实现全生命周期的客户经营，并提出用SaaS模式满足初创型小企业的管理与商务需求，这样用友就实现了对不同规模、不同阶段用户的全面涵盖。只做概念对行业的发展未必有利，SaaS作为一种新模式被推出，必定要体现其技术架构上的先进性、服务理念上的创新、更加安全可靠的运维平台、以及更先进的应用和服务支持。业内一位人士对SaaS的发展提出了更深刻的思考。	杨祉雄	正向	"Yonyou Weikun Network's innovative thinking SaaS application enters the fast lane On July 8, Yonyou Online officially announced the activation of Weikun Network (www.wecoo.com) as a new SaaS business operation platform, with new platform, new technology, new model, and new application as its main characteristics, focusing on building an ""good manager"" for enterprises. Some comments hold that, with its solid foundation, U友’s SaaS has established a comparative advantage in the industry. On October 10, in Ningbo, the second China Software Operation Service Conference - ""SaaS in China 2008"" was grandly held. More than 100 software providers, Internet companies, telecommunications and value-added service providers, as well as more than 200 enterprise users attended this grand event. Youdao software and Weiku.com won the ""Product Innovation Award for SMEs"" alone, and were evaluated as ""the most promising SaaS vendor"". ""SaaS in China in 2008"" - the theme of the second Software as a Service (SaaS) Operation Service Conference is ""SaaS Application Entry and Innovation"", which is in line with Yonyou's long-standing philosophy. Winning the Innovation Award for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) indicates that the industry highly recognizes NEEQ’s market positioning, understanding of customer needs, and strategic exploration of new products. One professional participant expressed. With the official operation of Weiku Network, UFIDA innovates the SaaS concept with ""grassroots thinking"", entering the SME market, and continuously serving enterprise management and business with innovative products. Yang Zixiong, senior vice president of UAP and general manager of online business division, is confident in ""becoming the leader of SaaS market in Asia"". The concept of ""grassroots thinking"" innovation SaaS service was proposed in early 2008, when NEEQ SaaS was still in the research and development stage, and positioned itself to serve small and medium-sized enterprises. Compared with its competitors in the industry, Yonyou seems to have started a bit late in the SaaS business operation. Two years ago, enterprises had already announced the launch of SaaS services with great fanfare, and the market was soon flooded with discussions and hype around SaaS. However, to this day, no domestic company has achieved tangible and convincing results in the SaaS business. An expert from Jieli Information provided an interpretation of this emerging market: some products are only oriented to e-commerce, some are concentrated on accounting, and there is a lack of management software products for the SME market, which has 42 million enterprises. Based on this, Yonyou, after conducting sufficient market research in the early stage and developing for a year in the later stage, proposed the customer positioning strategy of ""grassroots thinking"" after a two-year ""silence"". YouDao SaaS locks in entry-level users and serves the most extensive grassroots enterprises. Yang Zhixiong said that most of them were startups with less than 50 employees and annual turnover of less than 10 million yuan, with relatively simple business operations and management. A clear definition of the target market is a testament to Yonyou’s keen insight into the SaaS domain with this innovative concept. Innovation does not necessarily mean being the first in the industry to dare to venture into new fields, proposing more advanced and effective concepts or service forms, which better reflect the core value of innovation. The expert from Ji世咨讯 stated that from the perspective of the industry of software online operation, Yonyou’s accumulation has a competitive advantage, which has made many experts optimistic about Yonyou SaaS. It is not difficult to see the deep consideration that UFIDA has given to its SaaS business operations. On the one hand, almost all SaaS vendors target small and medium-sized enterprises, but pay little attention to grassroots enterprises. Yet, UFIDA found a blue ocean in the fiercely competitive SaaS market, and this field is so large that it can provide strong support for UFIDA's SaaS business. Affected by factors such as service costs and the maturity of demand, small business users with less than 50 employees are often regarded as ""non-economic customers"" by traditional management software vendors and become the ""long tail"" of the management software market. Based on the characteristics and needs of enterprise management, Yonyou segments customers of different scales to achieve the entire life cycle of customer operations, and proposes to meet the management and business needs of start-up small enterprises with SaaS mode, so that Yonyou can comprehensively cover customers of different scales and stages. It is not necessarily beneficial for the development of an industry to only focus on concepts. As a new model, SaaS must demonstrate its advanced technical architecture, innovative service philosophy, more secure and reliable operation and maintenance platform, as well as more advanced application and service support. An industry insider has offered deeper thoughts on the development of SaaS."
《极速赛车手》专为儿童拍摄周日全面公映(图)本报讯8月10日，《极速赛车手》将在内地影院全面上映，这是奥运会期间首部上映的好莱坞大片。该片是继《黑客帝国()》系列后，沃卓斯基兄弟的首部导演作品，中国演员余男(blog)和韩国偶像Rain(听歌)参与。另外，IMAX巨幕版本也将同时上映。故事小学生都能看懂自2003年《黑客帝国》系列结束后，沃卓斯基兄弟休息了整整3年，这期间只监制了一部《V字仇杀队》。《极速赛车手》是专门拍给少年儿童看的电影，所以在这部电影中你看不到复杂的故事和哲学思考，只剩下如万花筒一般绚烂的色彩和小学生都能看懂的故事。为了表达两兄弟对日本动漫大师吉田龙夫原作的怀念，全片大量采用绿幕拍摄，背景甚至模拟成了二维动画。赛车“马赫5号”空中换胎《极速赛车手》中的赛车“马赫5号”尽显威力，在片中大玩超越、漂移、翻转、碰撞等动作，还具有空中换胎、发射子弹等功能。导演还借助近1000个电脑特效镜头，将“马赫5号”和它的竞争对手放到沙漠、雪山等地比赛。演员余男与Rain扮姐弟为迎合亚洲市场，出品方华纳兄弟邀请中国演员余男、韩国偶像Rain、日本明星真田广之参演，其中余男和Rain在片中扮演姐弟。	沃卓斯基,余男,Rain,吉田龙夫,真田广之	正向	"The Fast and the Furious is specially shot for children and will be fully released in the cinemas on Sunday (picture). The news came that The Fast and the Furious will be fully released in the cinemas in mainland China on August 10, which is the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released during the Olympic Games. This film is the first directorial work of the Wachowskis after The Matrix series, and Chinese actor Yu Nan and Korean idol Rain participated. In addition, the IMAX version will also be released simultaneously. The story is so simple that even primary school students can understand it. After the ""Matrix"" series ended in 2003, the Wachowskis took a full three years off, during which they only produced V for Vendetta. The Fast and the Furious is a movie for children and teenagers, so you can't see complex stories and philosophical thinking in this movie, only colorful and simple stories that elementary school students can understand. To express the two brothers' nostalgia for the original work of Japanese animation master Ryūfū Yoshida, the entire film was shot with a green screen, and the background was even simulated as a two-dimensional animation. The ""Mach 5"" in the movie ""Need for Speed"" The ""Mach 5"" in the movie ""Need for Speed"" shows its power, playing a lot of overtake, drift, flip, collision and other actions, and also has the functions of tire changing in the air and shooting bullets. The director also used nearly 1,000 computer-generated special effects shots to place ""Mach 5"" and its competitors racing in the desert, on snow-capped mountains, and so on. Actor Yu Nannan and Rain played brother and sister to cater to the Asian market, and Warner Bros., the producer, invited Chinese actor Yu Nannan, Korean idol Rain, and Japanese star Nakadai Hiroki to star in the film, among whom Yu Nannan and Rain played brother and sister in the film."
大福证券建议增持国泰航空目标价18港元大福证券国泰于2008年蒙受巨大亏损86.96亿元，乃主要由于金融海啸及其后油价暴跌导致大额燃油对冲亏损所致，该公司于2009年转亏为盈，录得纯利46.94亿元(每股盈利：1.19元)。业绩强劲反弹，乃归因于业务逐步恢复、有效成本控制、因燃油价格反弹而显着拨回燃油对冲亏损，以及出售其于港机工程(0044.HK,$100.40)的部分股权所致。该公司宣派末期及年内唯一的股息每股0.10元，亦是2008年下半年因宏观环境艰难而暂停派息以来首次重新派息。若不计算非经常性项目，国泰的基础业绩则由2008年的亏损17.34亿元扭转为2009年的溢利8.52亿元。国泰于2009年的客运及货运收益分别按年下跌21%及30%，使该公司的收入按年下降23%至670亿元，反映行业衰退情况。由于头等及商务外游人数减少，以及经济客位价格受压，故乘客数量按年下降2%，而收益率则锐减20%，货运业务方面，货运量及收益率分别下降7%及27%。总营运成本按年下跌34%，其中燃油及非燃油成本分别按年减少63%及4%。由于燃油采购成本按年下跌49%，以及于2008年入帐的燃油对冲亏损80亿元中已拨回28亿元，故燃油仅占2009年总营运开支的28%，较去年骤减23个百分点。国泰维持其对冲未来12个月预计耗油量最少30%的目标。其未平仓燃油对冲合约的收支平衡水平为每桶80美元。于2009年为已届满的燃油对冲合约支付32亿元平仓后，国泰于2009年的债务净额仅按年上升4%至261亿元，相当于净负债比率62%，较去年下降7个百分点，但仍高于目标的50%水平。展望将来，我们预期对该公司业务的需求只会逐步复苏，因为需求下降部分属结构性而非纯粹周期性，同时，燃油价格回升的威胁亦是另一影响业务的因素。可幸的是，由于香港乃区内重要的空运中心，故国泰的形势仍较其全球同业优胜。我们继续建议增持该股，调整后的目标价为18.00元，相当于市净率1.7倍或预计企业价值对扣除利息、税项、折旧及摊销前盈利的比率9.7倍。分析员：曹福达	曹福达	正向	Fukfu Securities recommends increasing the target price of Cathay Pacific to HKD 18. In 2008, Cathay Pacific suffered huge losses of 8.696 billion yuan, mainly due to large fuel hedging losses caused by the financial tsunami and the subsequent sharp drop in oil prices. The company turned a loss into a profit in 2009, with a net profit of 4.694 billion yuan (earnings per share: 1.19 yuan). Strong earnings rebound attributed to gradual business recovery, effective cost control, significant reversal of fuel hedge losses due to the rebound in fuel prices, and the sale of a stake in Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering (0044.HK, $100.40). The company announced a final and the only dividend of the year, 10 cents per share, which is also the first dividend payment since the company suspended dividends in the second half of 2008 due to the difficult macro-environment. Excluding one-off items, Cathay Pacific’s underlying performance turned from a loss of HK$1.734 billion in 2008 to a profit of HK$852 million in 2009. Cathay’s passenger and cargo revenues fell by 21% and 30% respectively in 2009, causing the company’s revenue to fall by 23% to HK$67 billion, reflecting the decline in the industry. Due to the decrease in the number of first and business class travelers, as well as the pressure on the economy class price, the number of passengers decreased by 2% year-on-year, and the yield decreased by 20%. In terms of cargo business, cargo volume and yield decreased by 7% and 27%, respectively. Total operating costs fell by 34% year-on-year, with fuel and non-fuel costs declining by 63% and 4%, respectively. Due to a 49% decline in fuel procurement costs on an annual basis, and the reversal of 2.8 billion yuan of fuel hedging losses recorded in 2008, fuel accounted for only 28% of total operating expenses in 2009, a sharp decrease of 23 percentage points from the previous year. Cathay Pacific maintains its hedge on future fuel consumption for at least 30% of the next 12 months. The breakeven level for its open fuel hedge contracts is $80 per barrel. After paying 3.2 billion yuan to close out the expired fuel hedging contract in 2009, Cathay Pacific's net debt in 2009 increased by only 4% year-on-year to 26.1 billion yuan, equivalent to a net debt ratio of 62%, a decrease of 7 percentage points from last year, but still above the target level of 50%. Looking to the future, we expect that demand for the company's business will only gradually recover, as some of the decline in demand is structural rather than purely cyclical, and the threat of a rise in fuel prices is another factor affecting the business. Fortunately, despite Cathay Pacific's gloomy outlook, the Hong Kong carrier remains in a better position than its global peers, given its importance as a regional air hub. We continue to recommend an overweight position in the stock, with an adjusted target price of RMB18.00, equivalent to a price-to-book ratio of 1.7x or a price-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiple of 9.7x.

东南区巡礼：榜眼秀力助闪电侠大将军拖奇才后腿魔术莫里斯·埃文斯的离队和白人前锋加里蒂的退役，让魔术队的2、3号位出现了危机。主教练大范甘迪引进了皮特鲁斯和新秀考特尼·李，同时将使用雷迪克和博甘斯两名旧将，共四人试验得分后卫位置，皮特鲁斯和雷迪克有望脱颖而出。皮特鲁斯是摇摆人，防守能力尚可，并能远投，这些都是魔术队亟需补强的。雷迪克有成为优秀投手的潜力，但如果他的表现仍不够稳定，只会再度沦为替补得分后卫。34岁的安东尼·约翰逊将会是控卫杰米尔·尼尔森的第一替补，约翰逊上赛季场均得5.6分3.8次助攻。奇才罗杰·梅森上赛季为奇才队场均贡献个人职业生涯最高的9.1分，他改投马刺是奇才替补席上的一大损失。奇才队今夏的主要任务是和两名主将阿里纳斯、贾米森续约，引援动作并不大，重点补强的位置是组织后卫。由于阿里纳斯受伤，丹尼尔斯将出任先发组织后卫，新引进的迪克森和迪·布朗则将出任第二和第三替补。迪克森上赛季远投命中率达到41.7%。新秀麦克基身高2.13米，将是球队在内线的重点培养对象，先发中锋海伍德曾吹捧他为全联盟运动能力排前三的中锋。老鹰老鹰队的阵容调整在上赛季就已完成，今夏并没有特别大的动作。丘尔吉斯的出走和萨利姆·斯塔德迈尔的离队，是后场的巨大损失，但新来的莫里斯·埃文斯并非等闲之辈，他能打得分后卫和小前锋两个位置，上赛季场均贡献个人职业生涯最高8.9分，他将是小前锋马文·威廉姆斯的第一替补，并有望成为球队的第六人。穆雷同样经验丰富，先后曾在骑士、活塞队等队效力，将作为得分后卫乔·约翰逊的首席替补。中锋莫里斯曾身披尼克斯队战袍，能增加内线实力，总体来说，老鹰队今夏实力变化不大。山猫山猫队没有对主力阵容进行任何调整。小个子博伊金斯今夏选择去了意大利博洛尼亚队。选中第9号新秀控卫奥格斯丁是山猫今夏最引人注目的引援动作。奥格斯丁是可塑之材，但他身高只有1.83米，必须认真当好费尔顿的替补。不过，奥格斯丁最终会在1号位置上得到更多上场时间，甚至有可能迫使费尔顿去改打得分后卫。新来的香侬·布朗将成为球队第三替补得分后卫，上赛季他在骑士队和公牛队场均进账5.4分。热火榜眼秀比斯利的加盟无疑是对韦德的最大帮助。比斯利身体素质出众，假以时日，他可以超越马里昂，成为热火队的二号人选。加拿大籍中锋马格洛尔曾是全明星球员，他将缓解布朗特在内线的压力。第34号新秀查尔默斯在新秀培训课程班上被查出携带大麻，并连累比斯利被罚5万美金，查尔默斯将出任先发控卫班克斯的替补。为防止“白巧克力”离队后控卫位置实力大降，热火队还引进了利文斯顿，不过利文斯顿的健康状况令人担忧，他自2007年2月以来就没有参加过正式比赛。	莫里斯·埃文斯,莫里斯,埃文斯,加里蒂,大范甘迪,皮特鲁斯,考特尼·李,雷迪克,博甘斯,安东尼·约翰逊,杰米尔·尼尔森,罗杰·梅森,阿里纳斯,贾米森,丹尼尔斯,迪克森,迪·布朗,麦克基,海伍德,丘尔吉斯,萨利姆,斯塔德迈尔,马文,威廉姆斯,穆雷,乔·约翰逊,博伊金斯,奥格斯丁,费尔顿,香侬·布朗,比斯利,韦德,马里昂,马格洛尔,布朗特,查尔默斯,班克斯,利文斯顿	正向	"Southeast Tour: The Second Overall Drafted Player Helped the Flash General Dragged the Talents Behind the Magic Maurice Evans' Departure and Gary蒂姆·加里蒂's Retirement Caused a Crisis at the 2, 3 Positions of the Magic. Head coach Van Gundy brought in Pau Gasol and rookie Courtney Lee, and will use Redick and Bogans, two veterans, for a total of four players to experiment with the shooting guard position, and Gasol and Redick are expected to stand out. Petrus is a swingman with decent defense and long-range shooting, all of which are urgently needed by the Magic. Redick has the potential to be a great pitcher, but if his performance is still not stable, he will only be a backup shooting guard again. At 34, Anthony Johnson will be the first backup to point guard Jermel Nelson, who averaged 5.6 points and 3.8 assists last season. Roger Mason, who averaged a career-high 9.1 points per game for the Wizards last season, is a big loss to the bench of the Wizards when he switched to the Spurs. The Wizards' main task this summer is to renew contracts with two main players, Allen and Jamison, and their acquisition actions are not large, and the key position to be strengthened is the point guard. With Arenas out, Daniels will start at point guard, with newly acquired Dickson and Dee Brown coming off the bench as the second and third subs. Dickson made 41.7% of his three-point shots last season. The rookie MacKie, who is 2.13 meters tall, will be the key to the team's focus on the interior, and the starting center Hayward once praised him as one of the top three centers in terms of athletic ability in the entire league. The roster of the Eagles was adjusted last season, and there were no significant moves in the summer. Chorhys and Sallim Stoudemire's departure is a huge loss for the backcourt, but Maurice Evans, who can play shooting guard and small forward, is no ordinary player. He contributed a career-high 8.9 points per game last season. He will be the first substitute for small forward Marvin Williams and is expected to become the team's sixth man. Murray is also experienced, having previously played for the Cavaliers and Pistons, and will serve as the primary backup to Joe Johnson, the shooting guard. Morris, who once wore the Knicks uniform as a center, can add to the team's frontcourt strength, and overall, the Hawks' strength has not changed much this summer. The Bobcats did not make any changes to their starting lineup. Tiny Boykins chose to join the Bologna team in Italy this summer. Selecting the 9th overall new guard Augustine was the most eye-catching acquisition of the Bobcats this summer. Augustin is a good prospect, but at 1.83 meters, he must take his role as a backup to Ferreira seriously. But Augustine will eventually get more playing time at the one, and may even force Felton to switch to shooting guard. Shannon Brown, the new comer, will be the third substitute shooting guard, who averaged 5.4 points per game last season in the Cavaliers and Bulls. The Heat's second overall pick, Biscley, joining is undoubtedly the biggest help to Wade. Bisley has outstanding physical condition, and if given time, he can surpass Marion and become the second choice of the Heat. The Canadian center, Magloire, who was once an All-Star, will ease the pressure on Brown in the paint. The 34th pick, Chalmers, was found to have marijuana in the rookie orientation class, which led to Bisli being fined $50,000, and Chalmers will be the backup for Banks, the starting point guard. To prevent the point guard position from becoming weaker after ""White Chocolate"" left, the Heat also signed Livingston, but his health is a concern, as he has not participated in an official game since February 2007."

NYMEX June light sour crude oil futures contract settlement price rose 1.1%, to $99.49 per barrel. On May 20, according to a comprehensive media report, the NYMEX crude oil futures closed higher on May 20, as the oil price was supported by the cover of short positions after the news that al-Qaeda had plotted to hijack or sink oil tankers in 2010. NYMEX June light sweet crude oil futures contract settlement price rose by $1.05 to $99.49 per barrel, up 1.1%, with the contract expiring in 20 days. U.S. officials, citing intelligence gathered from Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan, say that al Qaeda’s goal is to spark a sharp rise in oil prices and trigger a Western economic crisis. But officials added that there were no indications that any specific or imminent terrorist attacks were being planned. Crude oil prices fluctuated during the trading session, falling to a low of $95.99 per barrel due to a stronger dollar and closing positions ahead of the expiry of the June contract, but reversed in the afternoon, reaching a high of $99.89 per barrel. Some analysts said that the large price fluctuations on June 20 may have been due to insufficient liquidity in the June contract and technical pressure. According to the monthly supply and demand report of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the total demand for crude oil and petroleum products in the United States in April increased by 5.2% year-on-year to 19.886 million barrels per day. Traders also believe that long-term crude demand is on the rise, as the US enters its summer driving season and fuel demand increases in emerging markets such as China. Analysts at Purvin&Gertz said that traders saw the decline in oil prices on the 19th as an opportunity to buy, because the geopolitical risks currently cannot be effectively resolved, and there will not be a sharp decline.

英国三名蒙面歹徒抢劫一家珠宝店中新社伦敦八月二十五日电(记者魏群)三名蒙面歹徒今天抢劫了英国牛津郡的一家珠宝店，抢走价值十五万英镑的名表。这是继本月伦敦相继发生四千万珠宝大劫案，及摩托车“飞贼”三十九秒内抢劫一家珠宝店后，英国发生的又一起珠宝劫案。经营珠宝店看来已经成为英国的“高危行业”。据当地警方透露，三名带着手枪和斧头的蒙面男人，今天下午闯入牛津郡班伯里商业街上一家名为“迈克尔·琼斯”的珠宝店，用随身携带的武器，威胁一男三女四名店员，抢走劳力士、卡地亚和百年灵等名贵手表。另一名开着奥迪车的同伙在店外等候，抢劫得手后他们驾车逃走。二十五分钟后，这辆汽车被发现遗弃在班伯里的一条公路上。店员告诉警方说，这几名蒙面劫匪看起来像亚洲人。负责调查此案的警官对《每日电讯报》记者说，好在没有人在抢劫中受伤，不过店员看起来受到极大惊吓。对于英国近期频发珠宝店抢劫案，一些民众对记者表示，歹徒连连得手，警方却无法破案，显示警方办案能力低下，更助长了歹徒仿效。也有人将劫案频发归咎于经济低迷，一些人为求一夜暴富而铤而走险。中新社伦敦八月二十五日电(记者魏群)三名蒙面歹徒今天抢劫了英国牛津郡的一家珠宝店，抢走价值十五万英镑的名表。这是继本月伦敦相继发生四千万珠宝大劫案，及摩托车“飞贼”三十九秒内抢劫一家珠宝店后，英国发生的又一起珠宝劫案。经营珠宝店看来已经成为英国的“高危行业”。据当地警方透露，三名带着手枪和斧头的蒙面男人，今天下午闯入牛津郡班伯里商业街上一家名为“迈克尔·琼斯”的珠宝店，用随身携带的武器，威胁一男三女四名店员，抢走劳力士、卡地亚和百年灵等名贵手表。另一名开着奥迪车的同伙在店外等候，抢劫得手后他们驾车逃走。二十五分钟后，这辆汽车被发现遗弃在班伯里的一条公路上。店员告诉警方说，这几名蒙面劫匪看起来像亚洲人。负责调查此案的警官对《每日电讯报》记者说，好在没有人在抢劫中受伤，不过店员看起来受到极大惊吓。对于英国近期频发珠宝店抢劫案，一些民众对记者表示，歹徒连连得手，警方却无法破案，显示警方办案能力低下，更助长了歹徒仿效。也有人将劫案频发归咎于经济低迷，一些人为求一夜暴富而铤而走险。	魏群,迈克尔·琼斯	负向	"Three masked robbers robbed a jewelry store in Oxfordshire, England, and stole 150,000 pounds worth of famous watches.

This year, the King's Jewelry presents the ""Imperial Secrets, Imperial Treasure鉴赏"" jewelry collection, which reinterprets the unique and noble imperial culture and artistic inspiration of Chinese history in modern high-end jewelry design, reflecting the King's Jewelry's advantage of inheriting and creative enthusiasm for integrating Eastern and Western cultural concepts and showcasing a rich and diverse product style. To showcase King's Jewellery's vision and passion for high-end jewellery, King's Jewellery specially held a VIP appreciation event from October 20 to 22 at the JW Marriott Hotel in Beijing, presenting a magnificent and dazzling visual feast for the deep autumn in the capital. Dr. Fong Shu-ching, chairman of King's Group, and Miss Fong Nows, general manager of King's Group Watch and Jewellery, personally attended the event to enjoy the high-end jewelry show performed by models. A three-day jewelry exhibition, featuring unique and limited edition jewelry pieces. Each piece of jewelry fully embodies the craftsmanship of the King's jewelry, infusing royal grace into the trend, and is both luxurious and fashionable, as well as having inheritable value. This exhibition attracted the attention and favor of wealthy and elegant ladies, business elites, and further established the leading position of King's Jewelry in the industry. In ancient China, the emperors enjoyed the highest status, and the monarchs enjoyed the most honorable and sacred things in the world. As a sovereign or a member of the imperial family, there were imperial auspicious objects and auspicious images for display, to demonstrate the authority and grandeur of the monarch, and the common people could not use them at will in the past. These artistic achievements and rare values of auspicious objects have reached the top of the world. Those passed down to later generations are all regarded as rare treasures and cultural heritage, shining in the long river of history. King's Jewellery took this as the inspiration for creative design, creating a new ""Di Zhen Bao Jian"" precious jewellery diamond series, integrating the style and craftsmanship of modern diamond jewellery, reinterpreting and bringing to life the design concepts of the precious treasures of the emperors in the past, allowing diamond jewellery enthusiasts to share the infinite creativity and noble taste. Each of the products on display in this exhibition is meticulously crafted, imbued with rich Chinese characteristics, exuding an extraordinary aura and an unceasing historical and cultural atmosphere, while also showcasing the royal style of King's Jewelry. The Empress Collar, a product of the exhibition, is based on the honor symbol of the Qing Dynasty – the ceremonial collar. Since traditional Chinese royal attire is a symbol of power, this set of jewelry can fully highlight the identity, status, and wealth of the wearer. The inspiration for ""The Great Wall烈阵长城"" comes from the magnificent historical building, the Great Wall, and is arranged with sparkling white diamonds to form layers. Rows of flawless diamonds simulate the grand Great Wall, and the 3.11-carat diamond pendant is like the Great Wall pass that continues without interruption. The product is as magnificent as the ten thousand cavalry and ten thousand soldiers of the Great Wall, and the beautiful rivers and mountains are right in front of us. The Dragon Eye ""Dragonfly Dragon"" is mainly decorated with dragon patterns. In Chinese culture, dragons symbolize emperors and imperial power. The design element of the dragon's long fangs and claws fully displays the imperial majesty. And the fine craftsmanship and materials of this jewelry set also set a new paradigm for high jewelry. The Empress Lotus Flower, “Lotus After the Empress,” is made of dazzling white diamonds with different cuts, depicting the lotus pattern, and bringing the elegant and refined shape of the lotus on the wall of the Forbidden City in Beijing to life on the jewelry. Moreover, the lotus also symbolizes purity without being tainted by the mud, symbolizing redemption, the most pure and perfect. This appreciation also presented a variety of diamond jewelry, including rare and dazzling yellow diamond jewelry, which shone brightly in the venue, and other high-end jewelry, including diamond jewelry set with jade, pearls, and rubies, which shone with a magnificent and dazzling appearance, making people fall in love at first sight. The high-end jewelry on display inside the venue is worth nearly 1 billion RMB.

日政府考虑上调收入税企业税支持重建[世华财讯]消息人士表示，日本政府正考虑在未来5至10年上调收入税及企业税税率方案，开源节流进行融资支持重建受重创的东北部地震灾区。综合媒体8月16日报道，消息人士表示，日本政府正考虑考虑提高收入所得税和企业税的税率，以筹集资金用于地震和海啸灾后东北地区的重建。消息人士称，政府正对于上调收入所得税的两个方案进行考虑，一个是在未来10年将收入所得税上调5%，另一个是在未来5年将收入税上调10%。两个方案均会产生大约7万亿日圆，折合913亿美元的财政收入。2010年年底时，日本首相菅直人表示，从2011财年起(始于4月1日)将日本40%的企业税下调5%，以促进出口、提振国内疲软的经济。这样的减税将会令日本的税收每年减少1.4至2.1万亿日圆，相当于2010财年财政收入的4%至5%。但因受到强震及海啸影响，造成巨大的财政缺口，日本政府正在考虑将上述企业税减税计划进行推迟，日本总债务水平占其GDP比重已超200%，此举可以避免通过大规模新发国债来筹集灾后重建资金，与此同时，日本政府还在考虑增加企业税，在未来5年产生大约4万亿日圆的财政收入，以支持重建工作。7月5日，日本政府批准了2万亿日元的追加预算，用于东北部地震灾区的重建，具体包括对受灾民众进一步提供经济援助、给予地方政府财政补贴，同时留出8000亿日元资金用于日后重建工作，并准备发行新债务及出售国有资产等措施进行进一步融资。日本政府预计要以用10年时间，耗资23万亿日圆来重建遭311超级大地震肆虐的地区。目前只有6万亿日圆已在第1次与第2次的追加预算案中获得通过，意味在头5年的重建工作中，还需筹措13万亿日圆。(牛??编译)	菅直人	正向	The Japanese government is considering raising the income tax and corporate tax rates to support reconstruction in the earthquake-stricken northeastern region in the next five to ten years, according to a source. The government is considering a plan to increase the income tax and corporate tax rates to support reconstruction in the earthquake-stricken northeastern region by increasing revenue and cutting expenses. On August 16, according to the media, a source said that the Japanese government is considering raising the tax rate of income tax and corporate tax to raise funds for the reconstruction of the northeast region after the earthquake and tsunami. Sources say that the government is considering two options for raising the income tax rate, one is to increase the income tax rate by 5% in the next 10 years, and the other is to increase the income tax rate by 10% in the next 5 years. Both options would generate around 7 trillion yen, or $91.3 billion, in fiscal revenue. By the end of 2010, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced that from April 1, 2011 (the beginning of the fiscal year), the corporate tax rate in Japan would be reduced by 5% to 40% in order to promote exports and boost the domestic economy that was in a weak state. Such a tax cut would reduce Japan’s tax revenues by 1.4 to 2.1 trillion yen annually, or 4% to 5% of fiscal revenues in FY2010. But due to the huge fiscal gap caused by the strong earthquake and tsunami, the Japanese government is considering postponing the above corporate tax reduction plan. The total debt level of Japan has exceeded 200% of its GDP, which can avoid raising funds for post-disaster reconstruction through the issuance of large-scale new government bonds. At the same time, the Japanese government is also considering increasing corporate taxes to generate about 4 trillion yen in fiscal revenue in the next five years to support reconstruction efforts. On July 5, the Japanese government approved a supplementary budget of 2 trillion yen for reconstruction in the northeastern earthquake-stricken areas, including further economic assistance to disaster victims, financial subsidies to local governments, and reserving 800 billion yen for future reconstruction, and plans to further finance through measures such as issuing new debt and selling state assets. The Japanese government expects to take 10 years and spend 23 trillion yen to rebuild the areas devastated by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 311. Only 6 trillion yen has been appropriated in the first and second supplementary budgets, meaning that an additional 13 trillion yen will be needed for reconstruction in the first five years.

热刺欲劫阿森纳1500万猎物铁闸从未说过想去枪手新浪体育讯　号称“暴力本”的布莱克本上赛季防守强悍，他们的中卫搭档功不可没。有“新特里”之称的菲尔-琼斯，在夏窗开启伊始就被曼联抢购；而现在，他们的队长克里斯-桑巴也成了转会市场上的香饽饽。据《每日邮报》报道，热刺已经提升了他们对桑巴的兴趣，桑巴的经纪人将在近几天内同两位潜在买家——阿森纳和热刺展开转会谈判。看来，热刺不但在赛场上同阿森纳是德比死敌，在转会方面也想和枪手正面交锋，一争高下。这个夏天，热刺没有同伍德盖特续约，前英格兰国脚成为自由球员之后被斯托克城签下；莱德利-金做了膝盖手术，无缘季前备战。仅有加拉、道森、卡布尔、巴松四员中卫，在雷德克纳普看来，是无法应付英超、欧联杯、足总杯、联赛杯多线作战的，因而，老雷将目光投向了桑巴。据悉，桑巴的标价是1500万英镑。《太阳报》日前曾报道，桑巴亲口表示想加盟阿森纳，但桑巴坚称他从未说过这样的话。他在推特上发布了一条微博：“关于我的报道完全是假的——我从没说过那些话。我是布莱克本球员，我永远不会说想要加盟别的俱乐部，那是对东家的不尊重。我现在很不开心。”(哈利)	布莱克本,菲尔-琼斯,琼斯,克里斯-桑巴,桑巴,伍德盖特,莱德利-金,加拉,道森,卡布尔,巴松,雷德克纳普,哈利	正向	"Spurs Want to Rob Arsenal of a 15 Million Defender, But He Has Never Said He Wants to Join the Gunners.

According to the Daily Mail, Tottenham has increased its interest in Samba, and Samba's agent will hold transfer talks with two potential buyers, Arsenal and Tottenham, in the near future. It seems that Tottenham not only regard Arsenal as their derby rivals on the pitch, but also want to compete with the Gunners in the transfer market. This summer, Tottenham did not renew Woodgate's contract, and the former England international became a free agent and was signed by Stoke City; Ledley King underwent knee surgery and was unable to participate in the pre-season training. Only Garrick, Dawson, Kaboul and Bardsley are centre-backs, in Redknapp’s view, and they are not enough to cope with the demands of the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup, so Old Red turned his attention to Samba.

Wang Xiaoshuai chats about his new film ""Rizhao Chongqing"" which has been nominated for this year's Cannes Film Festival, and his 10-year-old son Wang Tianran shares the hardships and joy of winning the gold prize in the Carnegie Music Competition in New York, a music competition in the music world. Wang Xiaoshuai received the news of his son's award at Cannes and went to meet his son's triumphant return with flowers. Host Zhao Ning: Welcome to all Sina netizens, I am the host Zhao Ning. Many of his friends know that Wang Xiaoshuai, the director, participated in the Cannes Film Festival with his new film ""Suzhou in the Sun"" recently. Although this film did not win an award at Cannes, he heard a very good news during the Cannes period, that his son Wang Tianran won a prize at Carnegie Music Festival in the United States. For this, he said that this award was more exciting than all his awards. Today, we are very happy to invite director Wang Xiaoshuai, Wang Tianran, who just returned from winning the award, and his music teacher Li Haichuan to be guests on Sina. Welcome to our three guests (applause), welcome to the three of you! Li Haichuan: Thank you, thank you. Host Zhao Ning: Congratulations again to Xiaotian Ran. Wang Tianran: Thank you. Host Zhao Ning: This is your first big award in your life. Wang Tianran: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: Did you say anything at the time about your acceptance speech? Wang Tianran: No. Zhao Ning, the host: Have you ever thought about what you would say in your acceptance speech if you had won? Wang Tianran: I have thought about it, and both me and my mother have arranged it. Host Zhao Ning: It's arranged, it was designed before, how was it designed at that time? Wang Tianran: Thank you very much for the chairmen of the committee, and then thank Mr. Li Haichuan, and then say those words of thanks. Host Zhao Ning: Why didn't you say thank you to your father? Wang Xiaoshuai: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: Sorry to say? Wang Tianran: Thank you to everyone at home. Wang Xiaoshuai: Everything is ready. Wang Tianran: Yes. Zhao Ning, the host: When your son was participating in the competition in the United States at that time, was Wang Director in Cannes at that time? Wang Xiaoshuai: The day Carnegie Hall played that piece of music, it was the 23rd, and it just happened to be the closing day of Cannes on the 23rd. We came back on the 24th, so I was in Cannes on the 23rd. Host Zhao Ning: Did you pay attention to your son's match at the same time? Wang Xiaoshuai: No, he actually won the gold award on the day he performed, and he already knew it. After winning the gold medal, there was a performance. Host Zhao Ning: Then you saw him off in Beijing, waiting for your son to return, and you even waited at the airport for more than three hours, right? Wang Xiaoshuai: We really did get there early, but the plane was a little late. Host Zhao Ning: Well, we can't wait at home anyway, so let's go to the airport. Wang Xiaoshuai: Can't miss the moment when he walks out, he should see the flowers, and feel a sense of achievement. Wang Tianran: Hmm. Host Zhao Ning: Watching dad holding flowers waiting at the customs exit. Wang Tianran: very excited. Host Zhao Ning: He has never expressed to you in this way... Wang Tianran: Never. Host Zhao Ning: This is the first time I bring you flowers. Wang Tianran: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: What did he say at that time? Wang Tianran: said ""Great son, keep working hard"", gave me the flowers, and then my mother took a few photos of me. Host Zhao Ning: I heard that you were pretty cool at the time, saying ""It's nothing"" or something like that? Wang Tianran: No. Wang Tianran won an award and was very happy, but he did not expect that his father would cry with joy. Host Zhao Ning: What was your feeling at that time? Wang Tianran: I'm very happy. I can get this award this time. Wang Xiaoshuai: Just say it's fine, it's normal, it's fine, no need to say official words, hmm, it's good, won an award, come again next time, keep working hard. Host Zhao Ning: Have you heard that your father celebrated you for several days? Is there any other way to celebrate after coming back from Beijing? Or buy you a gift to satisfy your long-term wish? Wang Tianran: He gave me a bunch of flowers and took me out for dinner that night, and that was it. Host Zhao Ning: How was that meal? Wang Tianran: It's really delicious, I love it very much. Wang Xiaoshuai: The kinds of food he likes to eat in his daily life. Wang Tianran: congee, vermicelli, etc. Wang Xiaoshuai: He will go to school the next day, and there was no holiday on Children's Day. Zhao Ning, the host: But you know, I heard that when Wang Xiaoshuai, the director, heard the news that his son had won an award in Cannes, he was so happy that he cried. Wang Xiaoshuai: Cry with joy, can't understand? Host Zhao Ning: It was the father who cried, he cried for a long time after hearing that you won the award. Wang Tianran: I have not been told about this matter. Wang Xiaoshuai: Did you not expect that Dad would cry? Wang Tianran: No. Wang Xiaoshuai: No, Dad won't cry in front of you, but he's happy and excited behind your back. Because I received a call at that time. Before leaving for Beijing, Hai Chuan teacher told me this news. Call my mother, call her grandmother, she was really so happy that she cried. Because grandpa just left and didn't see the grandson achieve this result. Teacher Li Haichuan introduced Wang Tianran, the youngest winner of the Carnegie Music Award in New York, to Zhao Ning, the host: Introduce the music teacher Li Haichuan as soon as possible, Li Haichuan teacher should have accompanied Tianran to participate in the competition in the United States. Li Haichuan: This competition has always been accompanied by his mother, because I am a piano teacher at China Conservatory of Music, the teaching workload is very large, very busy, at that time, I also had a struggle in my mind, I think it's still a chance for Tianran to exercise himself, originally should accompany him to go, but because I have my own job, I cannot take leave, so Tianran's mother mainly made a lot of investment in it. Including his regular piano practice, his mother also made a lot of commitments and sacrifices for him. Host Zhao Ning: This music award is called the Carnegie Music Award of New York. Li Haichuan: This is a very high-level competition in China. Everyone sees Tian Ran, a little boy who is only 10 years old, he is the youngest among the winners. There is also an adult group in this competition, and many of the adult group participants are students of piano majors in professional schools around the world. That is to say, he has been in many competitions at the international level, including those that he, who may have participated in major competitions at his age, participated in this competition. Actually, when we sent Tian Ran to participate in this competition, we just had a try, giving him a chance, so that he could see that there is more than what he knows, and try to exercise himself, and to strive for such a learning and observation opportunity. So he got first place at that time, and we were also a bit surprised. Of course, he is very powerful, but this is still inseparable from his own efforts on a daily basis. The competition for this competition was very intense. Host Zhao Ning: Because it is the group of 5-18 years old. Li Haichuan: Yes, and there are a total of 1,700 contestants, from six continents, and contestants from 31 countries around the world, which is announced by the organizing committee of the competition. Host Zhao Ning: From the perspective of a music teacher, do you think the main reason Tian Ran won the first prize is his talent or unique aspects in piano learning?"
罗马机场开始试行全身扫描安检新华网罗马3月4日电(记者王昀加)意大利首台全身扫描安检设备4日在罗马菲乌米奇诺机场投入试用。针对反对者认为全身扫描仪有可能危害人身健康、泄露个人隐私的忧虑，意大利卫生部长法齐奥、基础设施与运输部长马泰奥利当天参加在菲乌米奇诺机场举行的启动仪式时希望市民不必担心。他说：“我们的研究证明全身扫描仪不会对健康造成任何危险。”意大利民航总局局长里焦表示，全身扫描仪在设计时已经考虑到保护个人隐私的需要，在实际操作时扫描影像将被迅速删除。他强调，在未来4个到6个月的试用期内，乘客将自行选择是否接受全身扫描仪的检查。据报道，意大利原计划今年2月开始试用全身扫描仪，但由于“需要进行完善的准备工作”，试用推迟至今。意大利内政部长马罗尼今年1月份曾表示，将在3个月内开始在罗马菲乌米奇诺、米兰马尔彭萨和威尼斯三个机场试用全身扫描仪，重点检查飞往美国、英国、以色列等国的“敏感”国际航班。2009年12月25日，一名尼日利亚人乘坐达美航空公司航班从荷兰阿姆斯特丹飞往美国底特律，在飞机降落前企图引爆随身携带的爆炸装置，但未成功。这起未遂袭击事件给美国和欧盟敲响了安全警钟，许多国家都加强了航空安检力度。据报道，全身扫描仪利用一种名为毫米波的电磁波，能够“看穿”被扫描者的衣服，精确显现出人体曲线与携带的任何枪支、刀具和爆炸物等。此前，机场全身扫描仪的使用曾引发欧盟内部激辩。	王昀加,法齐奥,马泰奥利,里焦,马罗尼	正向	"The Rome airport began to try out full-body scanning security equipment. Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 4 (Reporter Wang Yunjia) The first full-body scanning security equipment in Italy was put into trial use at the Fiumicino Airport in Rome on the 4th. In response to the concerns of opponents that full-body scanners may pose a threat to personal health and privacy, Italian Health Minister Fazio and Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteoli hoped that citizens would not worry when they attended the opening ceremony at Fiumicino Airport on that day. He said, ""Our research has shown that full-body scanners pose no danger to health."" The head of the Italian Civil Aviation Authority, Rizzo, said that full-body scanners had been designed to meet the need to protect personal privacy, and that the scanning images would be deleted quickly in actual operation. He emphasized that during the next 4 to 6 months of the trial period, passengers would be able to choose whether to undergo a full-body scanner check. It was reported that Italy was originally scheduled to start testing full-body scanners in February this year, but the trial has been delayed until now due to the need for ""comprehensive preparatory work."" In January this year, Italian Minister of the Interior Maroni said that full-body scanners would be used in three airports in Rome Fiumicino, Milan Malpensa and Venice within three months, focusing on checking ""sensitive"" international flights to the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and other countries. On December 25, 2009, a Nigerian attempted to detonate an explosive device he was carrying on a Delta Airlines flight from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to Detroit, USA, but failed before the plane landed. This attempted attack has sounded the alarm for security in the US and the EU, and many countries have strengthened their aviation security measures. It is reported that the full-body scanner uses a type of electromagnetic wave called millimeter wave, which can ""see through"" the clothes of the person being scanned and accurately display the human body curve and any guns, knives, and explosives carried. Previously, the use of full-body scanners at airports had sparked a heated debate within the EU."
韦计划揭幕孙新政内测国奥打中超首战创始人缺席记者傅亚雨香河报道今天(11日)上午，国奥从香河基地出发前往沈阳，12日下午3点，他们将在铁西体育场迎战辽足，韦迪力主推出的国奥打中超计划将正式拉开序幕，这也是新任主帅孙卫的第一场“考试”。作为曾经的辽足十连冠成员，国奥新帅孙卫的“初试”就面对老东家，辽足主帅马林更是他当年的好友。“只要是比赛，我们当然都希望能赢下来，但我已不止一次说过，我不会注重这场的结果，但对过程一定有要求，比赛要有内容。”10日晚，孙卫对本报记者说。对这场比赛的特殊意义，孙卫表示：“还真没想那么多，对我们来说，这只是一场普通的比赛，我们的任务是通过比赛得到锻炼提高，同时进一步查找自身的问题。”孙卫最为人所熟知的经历，毕竟是在辽宁当球员时，对老东家的感情，还是不经意的流露出来，“我对辽宁有非常深厚的感情，在那整整呆了20年，一生最黄金的时代都是在那度过的。我跟球队一起取得了很多成就，创造了辽宁足球最辉煌的历史，我很骄傲。我也一直都在关注着辽宁的足球，今年辽足在中超打得不错，我真替他们高兴。”此番回归，孙卫颇有些衣锦还乡的味道，在家乡父老面前取得一场胜利来证明自己，这当然是最好的事情了。而国奥打中超中甲系列赛，是以韦迪为首的新一届足管中心班子的主要新政之一，首战辽宁，虽然体育总局副局长崔大林还未确定能否成行，韦迪身在南非观摩世界杯，暂时无法分身，但足管中心副主任于洪臣、国管部主任曹景伟都会到现场观战。能够在领导面前打出一场漂亮比赛，对上任就面对质疑的孙卫来说无疑非常有利。“我们这一周训练的核心目标是非常明确的。”孙卫说，在防守方面，希望通过比赛能检验国奥由攻转守环节中的提高，个人位置的选择，还有整体防守队形的组织，都是这一周训练的重点。“这是目前球队防守中存在的最大问题，我们这一周进行了强化训练，当然不能指望一下子就完全解决问题，但我希望能看到进步。”孙卫表示。而在进攻方面，他强调国足已经给国奥队设立了榜样，追求地面进攻、快速反击跟控制球相结合。“希望通过比赛来看看一周训练的效果，是否有改变。”周六的比赛，国奥队是否会有最好的状态？过去一周球队进行了高强度的训练。“队员身体肯定有反应，”孙卫表示，“我们要解决的问题比较多，因此只能靠增加课次、多利用时间来训练。”球员们也感觉很辛苦，但大家精神状态非常好，“这也是对他们意志力的考验，从长远来说我们需要意志力过硬的球员，队员要提高首先要战胜自己，这需要过程，我们不能总在低水平训练中转圈。”孙卫说，球员们也充分理解教练的要求，前锋王刚把自己的QQ签名改成了“疲劳、坚持、提高、再疲劳、再坚持、再提高。”训练量很大，但国奥不会乱上量。集训开始之初孙卫就告诉队员“要准备吃苦但不要害怕”，因为教练会科学地安排训练。6月10日，出征的前一天，教练组调整了训练计划，取消了原定的上午训练，下午的训练也是定位球的攻防，队员们得到了一定的缓冲，晚上的力量训练依旧进行。“队员们的躯干力量、上肢力量非常差，这导致了他们对抗能力弱。因为没力量，他们在身体接触时没自信，很容易丢掉重心从而失去对球的控制，因此力量训练要坚持。”孙卫介绍说。	韦计划,孙新政,傅亚雨,韦迪,孙卫,马林,崔大林,于洪臣,曹景伟,王刚	正向	"Wei plans to unveil Sun's new policy for the pre-Olympic team to play the first match of the Chinese Super League under the new coach Sun Wei, and the founder will not be present. Report by Fu Yayu in Xianghe today (11). In the morning, the pre-Olympic team left the Xianghe base for Shenyang. At 3 p.m. on December 12, they will play against Liaoning team in the West Stadium, and the Chinese Super League plan promoted by Wei Di will officially begin. This is also the first ""test"" of the new coach Sun Wei. As a member of the former Liaoning team that won ten consecutive championships, Sun Wei, the new head coach of Guoao, made his debut against his old team, Liaoning, and Ma Lin, the head coach of Liaoning, was his good friend back then. Of course, we all hope to win in any competition, but I have said more than once that I will not pay attention to the result of this competition, but there must be requirements for the process, and the competition must have content. Sun Wei told the reporter of the local media on the evening of October 10. Sun Wei said about the special significance of the match: ""I really didn't think about it that much. For us, it's just a regular match. Our task is to improve through the match and further identify our own problems."" Sun Wei's most well-known experience was when he was a player in Liaoning, and his feelings for his old team were inadvertently revealed, ""I have a very deep affection for Liaoning. I stayed there for 20 years, and the best years of my life were spent there. I have achieved a lot with the team, creating the most glorious history of Liaoning football. I am very proud. I have always been paying attention to Liaoning's football. Liaoning team played very well in the Chinese Super League this year, and I am really happy for them. This time, Sun Wei returned with a taste of returning in glory, and won a victory in front of his hometown elders to prove himself. Of course, this is the best thing to do. And the GuoAo vs. Super League and China League One series is one of the main new policies of the new leadership of the Football Administration Center, led by Wei Di. The first match is against Liaoning. Although Vice President of the General Administration of Sport, Cui Daling, is still uncertain whether he can attend, Wei Di is in South Africa to watch the World Cup and cannot spare the time, but the deputy director of the Football Administration Center, Yu Hongchen, and the director of the National Team Department, Cao Jingwei, will attend the match. It is undoubtedly very beneficial for Sun Wei, who faced doubts from the very beginning of his tenure, to be able to play a beautiful game in front of the leader. Our core goal for this week's training is very clear. Sun Wei said that in terms of defense, the focus of the training this week was to test the improvement in the transition from attack to defense, the selection of personal positions, and the organization of the overall defensive formation. This is the biggest problem in the current team's defense. We have strengthened training this week, of course, we cannot expect to solve the problem completely at once, but I hope to see progress. Sun Wei said. In attack, he emphasized that the national team had set an example for the national under-23 team, pursuing a combination of ground attack, rapid counter-attacks, and possession control. Hope to see the effect of one week's training through the competition, whether there is any change. Will the Guo Ao team have the best state for the match on Saturday? The team has been training intensively in the past week. The players will definitely have some physical reactions, "" said Sun Wei. ""We have a lot of problems to solve, so we can only increase the number of training sessions and make better use of time. The players also felt very tired, but everyone's mental state was very good. ""This is also a test of their willpower. In the long run, we need players with strong willpower. Players need to improve themselves first, which requires a process. We can't keep circling in low-level training. Sun Wei said that the players also fully understood the coach's requirements, and the forward Wang Gang changed his QQ signature to ""fatigue, persistence, improvement, fatigue, persistence, and improvement."" The training load is very heavy, but Guo Ao will not increase the load at random. Sun Wei told the players at the beginning of the training camp that they should be prepared to endure hardships but not to be afraid, because the coach would scientifically arrange the training. On the day before the departure on June 10, the coaching staff adjusted the training schedule, canceled the morning training, and the afternoon training was also set to focus on the attack and defense of set pieces. The players received some buffer time, and the strength training in the evening continued. The players' trunk strength and upper limb strength are very poor, which leads to their weak resistance. Because of lack of strength, they lack confidence when making physical contact, and it is easy to lose their balance and control of the ball, so strength training must be persistent. Sun Wei introduced."

An 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province. At that moment, the sky was dark and the earth was shaking, the mountains were collapsing and the houses were collapsing, and the whole world was in ruins. The Chinese people suffered great hardships. Earthquakes may be merciless, but people are full of compassion. When one place is in trouble, support comes from all directions. The national force for earthquake relief, including 100,000 PLA soldiers, quickly rushed to the disaster area to carry out rescue operations. Under the bright red military flag and in the green camouflage uniforms, there is a group of people who are active. They wear military uniforms and white coats, hold surgical knives or carry medical kits, and run around the clinics in various disaster areas to save lives and treat the injured.

“牵手门”一周年黄维德被传结婚去年11月，伊能静和黄维德被拍到十指紧扣的照片，被外界称为伊能静和庾澄庆离婚导火索。虽然事情已过一周年，但二人的情感生活仍是大众关注的焦点。近日，有传闻称黄维德已结婚，而伊能静则在博客上称“被伤害还是要爱”。近期，伊能静博客频频透露回台北与家人相处的信息，外界猜测，她与庾澄庆的感情可能在回暖。不过，伊能静也透露出她对情感的得失，她在博文《而不管如何》中写到：“不管如何被欺骗还是要诚实”，似乎是在对牵手事件发表周年感触。与此同时，有台湾媒体同行透露，黄维德可能已和相交10余年的女友小陆结婚。“10月他有回台北，有招待亲朋。”对此，有媒体试图向黄维德本人了解情况，但其电话一直无人接听。不过之后，黄维德还是通过短信澄清了自己结婚的消息，但只有短短五个字——“我未婚，谢谢”。综合	黄维德,伊能静,庾澄庆,小陆	正向	"One year anniversary of ""hand-holding door"" Huang Weidé was reported to be married last November, when Yingerjing and Huang Weidé were photographed with their fingers tightly clasped, which was called the trigger for Yingerjing and Yichenqing's divorce.

Recently, rumors said that Huang Weidé had got married, and Yi Nengjing said on her blog ""to be hurt, but still love"". Recently, Yi Nengjing's blog frequently revealed information about spending time with her family in Taipei, and the outside world speculated that her relationship with Jay Chou may be warming up. However, Ying Jie also revealed her gains and losses in terms of emotions.

In October, he went back to Taipei to entertain his relatives and friends. In response, the media tried to get in touch with Huang Weidé himself, but his phone was never answered.

中国冶金下半年AH股上市明报报道指，中国冶金科工集团(下称中冶集团)拟在今年上半年向港交所递交招股文件，最快将于09下半年于沪港两地，分别以A、H上市。中冶目前尚未确定具体集资金额，但若成事，估计将创下08年以来本港挂牌新股集资规模之最。央企之一的中冶集团，主要从事海外工程承包、资源开发、纸业、技术装备制造及房地产开发等，是国家确定的重点资源类企业，仅在海外矿山资源投资便达到10亿美元，拥有铁、铜、金、镍、钴、铅、锌、铝等生产企业和矿山资源。集团07年全年总收入175.8亿美元，08年《财富》世界500强排名中位列第480位。据称，担任中冶集团H股承销商的包括摩根士丹利。接近承销人士消息指，上市准备已在操作中，但鉴于近期市?波动剧烈，集资规模及上市时间仍未确定。但去年3月曾有内地媒体报道，中冶计划于08年8月末在两地挂牌，集资总额高达400亿元人民币。但自去年9月始，中国证监会开始冻结A股IPO，中冶上市的计划也暂时搁置。09新年过后，A股指数强势反弹，市场纷传A股IPO有望重新开闸，这或将为中冶A股重新启动招股计划提供契机。市场消息指，中冶拟将除纸业外的所有业务整体上市，但集资规模将大大缩减。锦胜首日挂牌升7%赶上新股“回暖潮”、成功上市集资5800万元的锦胜集团(0794)，昨首日挂牌，未受到早前上市两天便告急跌的瑞金(0246)影响，收市价报1.2元，较招股价高7.1%，未计及手续费，每手可微赚160元。主席庄金洲表示满意股价表现，并指纸价目前相对平稳，料会逐步向好。锦胜获主要供货商玖龙纸业(2689)副行政总裁张成飞，以及理文造纸(2314)行政总裁李文俊入股共7.5%，但两人自招股以来未曾露面支持，直至昨日上市仪式上，玖龙纸业财务总监张元福，以及李文俊之弟李文斌，才各自代表公司到场祝贺。被问到上述策略性股东会否增持或有进一步合作，庄金洲没有直接响应，只表示该两名股东对公司有充分了解及信心，一直有长期的合作关系。至于昨日开始招股的另一只新股亚洲木薯资源(0841)，首日?展表现平平，例如信诚证券只录得100万元，辉立证券更录得零?展。	庄金洲,张成飞,李文俊,张元福,李文斌	正向	"China Metallurgical Group (hereinafter referred to as China Metallurgical Group) is expected to submit an application for listing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the first half of this year, and is expected to list on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges separately in the second half of 2009. The Ming Pao reported that China Metallurgical Group plans to submit an application for listing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the first half of this year, and is expected to list on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges separately in the second half of 2009. CSIC has not yet determined the specific amount of funds to be raised, but if it succeeds, it is estimated to set the record for the largest scale of funds raised by newly listed stocks in Hong Kong since 2008. One of the central enterprises, China Metallurgical Group, mainly engages in overseas engineering contracting, resource development, paper industry, technical equipment manufacturing, and real estate development. It is a key resource enterprise determined by the state, with overseas mine resource investments reaching 1 billion US dollars, and owns iron, copper, gold, nickel, cobalt, lead, zinc, and aluminum production enterprises and mine resources. The group's total revenue for the whole year in 2007 was $17.58 billion, and it ranked 480th in the Fortune Global 500 in 2008. Morgan Stanley is reportedly one of the underwriters for the China Metallurgical Group's H shares. According to the information from the underwriter, the preparation for listing is in operation, but the fundraising scale and listing time are still uncertain due to the recent market fluctuations. But last March, a mainland media report said that CSCEC planned to list in two places in late August 2008, raising a total of 40 billion yuan. But since September last year, CSRC has frozen A-share IPOs, and the listing plan of CSRC has also been temporarily shelved. After the New Year, the A-share index rebounded strongly, and the market spread rumors that the A-share IPO might be reopened, which may provide an opportunity for China Metallurgical to restart its share issuance plan. Market rumors suggest that CSRC plans to list all its businesses except papermaking, but the scale of the fundraising will be significantly reduced. Jinsheng rose 7% on its first day of listing, catching the new issue ""recovery wave"", and successfully raised HK$58 million in its first day of listing, Jinsheng Group (0794), which raised HK$58 million, was not affected by Ruijin (0246), which fell sharply after listing for two days, and closed at HK$1.2, 7.1% higher than the issue price. Without taking into account the handling fee, a small profit of HK$160 can be made for each hand. Chairman Zhuang Jinzhou expressed satisfaction with the stock price performance and said that the paper price is currently relatively stable and is expected to gradually improve. Jinsheng has received shares from Zhang Chengfei, deputy administrative vice president of Jiulong Paper Industry (2689), and Li Wenjun, president of Liwen Paper Industry (2314), for a total of 7.5%. However, neither of them has appeared to support the company since the initial public offering. It was not until the listing ceremony yesterday that Zhang Yuanguo, financial director of Jiulong Paper Industry, and Li Wenjun's brother, Li Wenbin, attended the ceremony to congratulate the company on behalf of their respective companies. When asked whether the strategic shareholders would increase their holdings or have further cooperation, Zhuang Jinzhou did not respond directly, but only said that the two shareholders had a full understanding and confidence in the company, and had a long-term cooperative relationship. As for the new issue of Asia Cassava Resources (0841), which started its share sale yesterday, the initial performance was unremarkable, for example, the turnover of Suning Securities was only 1 million yuan, while that of Phillip Securities was zero."
小伙追到富家女后偷窃同学财物谈恋爱如果没出意外，冯真这会儿应该正忙着办理签证，准备出国留学的事，然而前天他却站在南京鼓楼区法院的法庭上，面对严厉的法官，背对伤心的父母，接受法律和心灵的双重审判。为了给女友留下“潇洒大方”的好印象，这个“准留学生”竟然将手伸向同学，短短数十天偷了2万余元财物。令人哭笑不得的是，被抓之后，他竟“天真”地以为，把东西还给同学就没事了。鼓楼法院依法判决他有期徒刑3年，缓刑4年，并处罚金5万余元。追到了漂亮富家女冯真是河南人，今年才刚满20岁。他打小就有出国留学的梦想，所以去年高中一毕业就来到南京某预科学校，准备先读一年，然后直接出国读本科。对于他的家庭来说，这个决定做得并不容易。冯真的父母都是搞个体经营的，手头有些积蓄，但算不上太富裕，他们心里十分清楚，一旦把儿子送出国，殷实的家境就面临着被“掏空”的危险。然而，哪个父母不望子成龙，为了孩子的未来，他们咬咬牙下定了决心——就是再苦再累也要供他读下去。2007年9月上旬，冯真在父母的陪同下来到南京某预科学校，开始了出国前的预备学习。看着父母殷切的目光，他一再保证会好好读书，争取尽快过英语关，来年申请一所好学校。开学初期，他的确很用功，几乎每天晚上都泡在图书馆里看书。然而这种平静的生活并没有维持多久。2007年底，在学校联谊活动中，他被一个名叫晓敏的女孩吸引了，她温柔可爱，衣着打扮又时髦。在这之后，冯真开始有意地接近晓敏，又是发消息嘘寒问暖，又是送鲜花表明心意，很快就打动了她，并如愿成为她的男友。风光的爱情太昂贵在这所预科学校里，家境富裕的学生比比皆是，跟其他人相比，冯真无论哪方面都不算出众。这么一个平平无奇的小子，却追到了风云人物晓敏，这让不少同学啧啧惊奇，也让冯真本人得意不已。然而风光的爱情是很昂贵的，晓敏家境很好，从小就被人捧着宠着，吃的穿的用的无一不讲究品质，谈恋爱更是追求浪漫与氛围。为了讨女友欢心，冯真表现得特别“潇洒”特别“大方”，动辄带她出入高档餐厅，一逢周末就去逛街购物，平时鲜花礼物不断。看到女友接受礼物时欢喜雀跃的模样，他觉得特满足特有面子。如此高规格的恋爱水准，生活费哪里够花，很快他就把父母开学时给的钱用光了。此后，他又以购买学习资料、报辅导班的名义要了几次，父母总是一口答应，隔日就将钱汇到他卡上。冯真花着这些钱，心里难受极了，他知道父母供他出国留学已十分勉强，根本没有多余的钱再给他挥霍。钱不够伸手偷同学恋爱不能不谈，父母那又不好开口，该怎么办呢？冯真思来想去，竟把手伸向同一栋宿舍楼的同学。2008年3月的一天，他发现某宿舍门虚掩着，里面没人，便趁机溜进去，把一位同学的IBM笔记本电脑偷了出来。得手后用书包装着电脑，到珠江路一家软件店兜售，卖得1400多元。最初他没敢花这钱，因为毕竟是偷来的，心里有点慌。然而过了好几天，谁都没怀疑到他，他这才安了心，将女友约出来潇洒了一番，很快将钱挥霍一空。有了第一次就有第二次，没过几天，他又瞄上了另一位同学的电脑，并偷了出来，到同一家软件店销赃。一次次的得手，让冯真胆子越变越大，以至于后来手头一紧，他就到各个宿舍转悠转悠寻找目标，再找个机会偷出来卖掉。直到有同学无意翻到他的柜子，才发现他盗窃的事实。原来短短数十天时间，他已偷了4台笔记本电脑、一台手机和一台游戏机，价值达到2万余元。被发现后，冯真很快被公安机关带走，对于盗窃事实，他供认不讳。当被问到为何只在宿舍偷窃时，他竟回答说：以为偷同学的东西后果不严重，被发现后还回去就没事了。“准留学生”法律知识如此匮乏令人哭笑不得。法官落槌宣判的一刹那，冯真的留学梦基本破碎了。接下来的4年，他只能待在家中，接受当地公安部门的监管。然而，让他付出昂贵代价的爱情却并不可靠，据冯真的代理律师透露，行窃的事暴露后，晓敏就消失了，直到开庭那天都没有出现。只有父母来到了法庭，为他伤心落泪。陈珊珊	冯真,晓敏,陈珊珊	负向	"The young man, after chasing after a rich girl and stealing his classmates' property while dating, should have been busy applying for a visa and preparing for his overseas studies at this moment. However, he was standing in the courtroom of the Gulou District Court in Nanjing, facing a stern judge and turning his back to his heartbroken parents, undergoing a double trial of law and heart. In order to leave a good impression on his girlfriend as a ""handsome and generous"" person, this ""prospective overseas student"" actually reached out to his classmates and stole more than 20,000 yuan worth of property in just a few dozen days. It is comical that after being caught, he actually thought that returning the items to his classmates would be enough. The Gule Court lawfully sentenced him to three years in prison with four years’ reprieve and a fine of more than 50,000 yuan. Chasing after the beautiful and wealthy Miss Feng Zhen, who is from Henan and is only 20 years old this year. He has always dreamed of studying abroad since he was young, so he came to a preparatory school in Nanjing last year after graduating from high school, intending to study for one year and then go abroad to study for a bachelor's degree directly. It was not an easy decision for his family. Feng Zhen’s parents were both engaged in individual business, with some savings, but not very wealthy. They were very clear that once their son was sent abroad, the prosperous family would face the danger of being “emptied out”. But, which parent doesn't hope their child will succeed, and, for their child's future, grits their teeth and makes up their mind—no matter how hard and tiring it is, they will support their child to continue his studies. Feng Zhen, accompanied by her parents, arrived at a preparatory school in Nanjing in early September 2007, and began her preparatory studies before going abroad. Looking at the expectant eyes of his parents, he repeatedly promised to study hard and pass the English test as soon as possible, and apply to a good school next year. At the beginning of the semester, he was indeed very diligent, and almost studied in the library every night. However, this peaceful life did not last long. At the school reunion in late 2007, he was attracted to a girl named Xiaomin, who was gentle and cute, and dressed fashionably. After that, Feng Zhen began to approach Xiaomin intentionally, sending messages to show his concern and sending flowers to express his feelings, and soon won her over, and became her boyfriend as he wished. The romantic scenery is too expensive. In this preparatory school, there are many students from wealthy families. Compared to others, Feng Zhen is not outstanding in any aspect. Such an ordinary boy managed to catch the attention of the rising star Xiao Min, which amazed many of his classmates and made Feng Zhen very proud of himself. However, a beautiful love is very expensive. Xiao Min comes from a wealthy family, and has been pampered since childhood. Everything she eats, wears, and uses is of high quality, and she pursues romance and atmosphere in her dating. In order to please his girlfriend, Feng Zhen showed himself to be particularly “cool” and “generous,” taking her to high-end restaurants and shopping on weekends, and sending her flowers and gifts all the time. Seeing his girlfriend's delighted reaction to receiving a gift, he felt particularly satisfied and honored. With such high standards for romance, how could his living expenses be enough? He soon spent all the money his parents gave him when they sent him to school. Afterwards, he asked for money several times under the pretense of buying study materials and attending tutoring classes, and his parents always agreed immediately, transferring the money to his card the next day. Feng Zhen spent all this money and felt extremely sad. He knew that his parents had already strained themselves to send him abroad for further studies, and there was no extra money for him to waste. Money is not enough, reaching out to steal classmates' love cannot be talked about, and it's not good to talk to parents. What should I do? Feng Zhen thought and thought, and finally reached out to a classmate in the same dormitory building. One day in March 2008, he found that the door of a dormitory was slightly ajar and no one was inside, so he took the opportunity to sneak in and stole an IBM notebook computer from a classmate. After the robbery, he wrapped the computer in a book and sold it at a software store on Jiangzhulou, getting over 1400 yuan. At first, he was too scared to spend the money, as it was stolen, and he felt a little nervous. However, for several days, no one suspected him, and he finally felt at ease, taking his girlfriend out for a good time, and quickly spent all the money. There was a second time after the first, and after a few days, he set his eyes on another classmate's computer and stole it, selling it at the same software store. Success after success made Feng Zhen bolder and bolder, to the point that when he was short of money, he would wander around the dormitories looking for targets and then find an opportunity to steal them and sell them. It was not until a classmate accidentally came across his locker that his theft was discovered. In fact, in just a few dozen days, he had stolen four laptops, a mobile phone, and a game console, with a total value of more than 20,000 yuan. After being discovered, Feng Zhen was quickly taken away by the public security organs. Regarding the theft, he confessed without reservation. When asked why he only stole from dormitories, he replied that he thought the consequences of stealing from classmates were not serious, and that everything would be fine if he returned it after being discovered. It is comical that the legal knowledge of ""potential overseas students"" is so scarce. At the moment when the judge banged the gavel to announce the verdict, Feng Zhen's dream of studying abroad was basically shattered. For the next four years, he will be confined to his home and subject to the supervision of the local public security bureau. However, the expensive love that cost him was unreliable. According to Feng Zhen’s agent lawyer, Xiao Min disappeared after the theft was exposed and did not appear until the day of the trial. Only the parents came to the court and shed tears for him.

大师傅大势分析：坚守低水勒沃不败阿森纳难出冷本期周六彩包含了四大联赛的赛事，主打还是英超和德甲。由于本周中和下周中有欧冠和联盟杯，所以周末联赛不可能不受到影响，但所受影响大小不一，未必对战局造成关键的影响。阿森纳难以出冷稳胆最看好的是阿森纳。阿森纳VS布莱克，不管阿森纳目前欧冠形势如何，都要提升联赛的名次，与维拉也仅3分的差距，阿森纳联赛不可能放弃。在上周末的足总杯赛中，阿森纳替补阵容轻取伯恩利，阿森纳完全控制战局，而且场上配合默契。小将沃尔科特缺阵四个月后复出，目前阿森纳伤病不多，完全能够应付双线作战，而且都可能排出很强的阵容应战。本场比赛的平均赔率为1.433.957.63，对比以往两队交锋的赔率，阿森纳主场胜赔相差只在0.05左右，考虑到阿森纳双赛，而且是欧冠16强淘汰赛的背景，开出此平均赔率并没有丝毫看低阿森纳的意思。而在历史对阵中，主胜相差不多的情况下，客胜赔和平局赔率都要比目前的低许多，可见平局和客胜其实已被博彩公司认为比以往更难于出现。主胜调低埃弗顿可看好埃弗顿出冷的几率要比阿森纳大得多，埃弗顿排名第六，比阿森纳少4分，比之后的西汉姆多6分，处于一个难上难下的位置，在这样的背景之下，埃弗顿本应该是不会被高看的一方，但实际上赔率所反映的并不是如此。本场比赛的平均赔率为1.493.737.05，而仅一天前才是1.503.686.88，主胜普遍调低，明由初盘的1.563.605.40调整为1.503.656.20，而Bet365虽然主胜不变，但客胜和平赔却均有调高，由初盘的1.503.607.00调整为1.504.007.50，很明显，还不到临场就已经发生不小的变化，这说明埃弗顿VS斯托克对于主队应该有重大利好，值得信任。博尔顿主场不胜博尔顿VS富勒姆，两队都是中游球队，都是无欲无求型，首先战意上就可疑，胜平负双方恐怕都不会过于在意。英超此类情况，赛果受市场影响的可能性更大。再来分析双方近况，博尔顿主场三连胜，其中包括排名高于富勒姆的西汉姆。富勒姆则是在杯赛和联赛中连续三场不胜，但客场也有逼平阿森纳这样让人不可小觑的战果。平均赔率开出2.123.203.31。亚盘目前在1.90平/半2.00左右，对应欧赔相符。在上面所述的背景之下，博尔顿主场当然会给人更有信心，市场反映上盘注码很大几率会超过下盘，主队博尔顿赢出很难。勒沃不败反弹赫塔VS勒沃，本场比赛是我极有把握的一场。先看双方背景，赫塔近期战绩较佳，近四场比赛除客场负于沃尔夫之外，其他三战全部胜出，其中包括击败拜仁。勒沃则是连续三场联赛不胜，上轮被波鸿客场逼平。由于勒沃并非没有机会拿到欧冠资格，所以远不到放弃的时候，这场比赛必然和赫塔死拼。平均赔率2.263.232.95，以双方的近况，主胜稍有偏高，在2.10-2.15范围内才相符。Bet365开出的赔率2.303.402.75，更是看低主队，而这并不是个别，超过半数的主流公司主胜都至少在2.30或以上。亚盘统一为2.08平/半1.82左右，客队低水已摆明了态度，从初盘开出至今水位几乎没有调整，预计到临场也不可能会有大变，客队一定是坚持低水，保持不败的可能性极高。上周再负的瓦伦西，本轮坐镇主场，主胜开出1.70的赔率，明显偏高，不能排除连续出冷的可能性，彩民做胆需谨慎。	勒沃,沃尔科特,博尔顿,富勒姆,赫塔,波鸿	正向	Master's big trend analysis: Le Havre will not lose with low water, and Arsenal is hard to produce a cold. This Saturday's lottery includes the events of four major leagues, with the main focus on the Premier League and Bundesliga. Due to the Champions League and UEFA Cup in the middle of this week and next week, the weekend league cannot be unaffected, but the degree of impact is different, and it may not have a key impact on the course of the game. Arsenal is difficult to produce a cold and steady胆is most looking forward to Arsenal. Arsenal vs Black, regardless of how the current situation of the Champions League is, Arsenal must improve its league position, with only a 3-point gap from Villa, Arsenal cannot give up the league. In the FA Cup match last weekend, Arsenal's reserves beat Burnley easily, and Arsenal completely controlled the game, and the players on the field cooperated well. Walcott, who has been out for four months, is back, and Arsenal is currently short of injuries and can cope with double-line warfare, and it is possible to field a strong team. The average odds for this match are 1.433.957.63. Compared with the odds of the two teams' previous matches, the home win odds of Arsenal only differ by 0.05. Considering that Arsenal has two matches and is in the 16th round of the UEFA Champions League, the average odds are not at all low on Arsenal. In the historical matches, when the home win odds are not much different, the away win and draw odds are much lower than the current ones, indicating that the draw and away win are actually considered more difficult to occur by the bookmakers than before. The bookmaker has reduced the main win, Everton is more likely to be a surprise than Arsenal, Everton is in sixth place, 4 points less than Arsenal, and 6 points more than West Ham, in a difficult position to climb or fall, under such circumstances, Everton should not be a favored side, but the odds do not reflect this. The average odds for this match are 1.493.737.05, while it was 1.503.686.88 just one day ago, the home win was generally reduced, and the initial odds of 1.563.605.40 were adjusted to 1.503.656.20. Although Bet365 did not change the home win, the away win and the draw odds were both increased, from the initial odds of 1.503.607.00 to 1.504.007.50. It is obvious that there has been a significant change before the match, which indicates that Everton vs Stoke should be a major benefit for the home team, and it is worth trusting. Bolton's home game is not unbeatable. Bolton vs. Fulham, both are mid-table teams, both are without desire, so the first intention is suspicious. The two sides of win, draw and lose probably will not pay too much attention. In the case of the Premier League, the outcome of the match is more likely to be influenced by the market. Then analyze the recent situation of both sides, Bolton has won three consecutive home games, including West Ham, which is ranked higher than Fulham. Fulham has not won in three consecutive matches in the league and in the cup, but there is also a draw against Arsenal away from home, which is not to be underestimated. The average odds opened at 2.123.203.31. At the moment, the Asian handicap is around 1.90平/半2.00, which corresponds to the implied odds. Under the above background, Bolton's home field of course gives people more confidence, and the market's reaction is that the upper disk bet will have a very high probability of exceeding the lower disk, and it is difficult for the home team Bolton to win. Leverkusen will bounce back against Hertha. This match is one that I am very confident about. First, look at the background of both sides. Herta has performed better in recent matches. In the last four games, apart from losing to Wolfsburg away, they won the other three games, including defeating Bayern. Leverkusen has not won in the last three league matches, and was held to a draw by Bochum in the last match. Since Leverkusen is not without the chance of qualifying for the Champions League, there is no reason to give up yet, and this match will definitely be fought to the death with Hertha. The average odds are 2.263.232.95, and the home win is slightly too high given the recent form of both teams, and should be in the range of 2.10-2.15. Bet365 offered odds of 2.303.402.75, which was even lower for the home team, and this was not an exception, more than half of the main companies had the home win at 2.30 or above. The Asian handicap is unified at 2.08 draw/quarter 1.82, and the low water of the away team has already shown its attitude. Since the initial opening of the water level, there has been little adjustment, and it is expected that there will be no major changes to the water level before the match. The away team will definitely maintain low water, and the possibility of not losing is very high. Last week, Valencia lost again. At home, the home win was offered at a 1.70 odds, which was clearly too high. It cannot be ruled out that there is a possibility of consecutive cold. Caution is needed for bettors to choose the main bet.

RJ调升BedBath&Beyond股票评级新浪财经讯北京时间周六凌晨，一位华尔街分析师宣布，调升家庭用品连锁店BedBath&BeyondInc.的股票评级，理由是股价已遭受严重打压，随着竞争对手清盘销售的结束，这只股票很有可能上涨。RaymondJames的分析师布德-巴格奇(BuddBugatch)向投资者指出，他已将这家总部位于新泽西州Union的零售商的股票评级从“与大盘持平”调升至“优于大盘”。巴格奇在一份研究报告中写道：“我们论断的主要依据是这只股票已被严重低估，以及Linens'nThings停业清盘销售活动临近结束。随着投资者开始寻找高品质的股票，BedBath&Beyond有望成为首批复苏的股票之一。”今年九月以来BedBath&Beyond的股票已下跌约30%，随着Linens'NThings停业清盘，该股遭受了更大卖压。10月17日，Linens'NThings店面的商品开始低价抛售。巴格奇还称：“鉴于Linens'NThings的清盘销售即将结束，我们估计投资者将迎来一个更合理的定价环境。”这位分析师指出，虽然处在经济低迷期，但是BedBath&Beyond的销售和运营盈利率令人羡慕，“管理层的推销和成本控制能力是我们所知的企业中最好的，虽然他们偶尔与投资者沟通不足应予以批评。”巴格奇调升BedBath&Beyond的评级前，本周二该公司宣布，调降对第三财季每股盈利的预期，新预期范围为31至35美分，原预期为41至47美分。新财测明显低于华尔街人士目前普遍预期的每股盈利40美分。BedBath&Beyond指出，第三季的同店销售--即开张至少一年店面的销售额--可能同比下滑5.6%。截至周五美东时间下午2:15(北京时间周六凌晨3点15分)，在纽约证交所上市的BedBath&Beyond股票上涨77美分，至23.63美元，涨幅为3.4%。	布德-巴格奇,巴格奇	正向	RJ upgraded the stock rating of BedBath & Beyond. Sina Finance News, on the morning of Saturday, a Wall Street analyst announced that the stock rating of the home goods chain BedBath & Beyond Inc. was upgraded, citing that the stock price had suffered serious suppression, and that this stock was likely to rise as the end of the competitors' clearance sales. RaymondJames analyst BuddBugatch pointed out to investors that he has upgraded the stock rating of this retailer headquartered in Union, New Jersey, from “equal-weight” to “outperform”. Bagchi wrote in a research report that the main basis for our judgment was that the stock was severely undervalued and that the Linens'nThings liquidation sale was nearing its end. As investors begin to seek high-quality stocks, BedBath & Beyond is expected to be one of the first stocks to recover. BedBath&Beyond’s stock has fallen by about 30% since September this year, and the stock has suffered even greater selling pressure as Linens'NThings closes its doors. On October 17, Linens'NThings store began to sell off its merchandise at a discount. Bagchi also said that, given the imminent end of Linens'NThings liquidation sales, we expect investors to see a more reasonable pricing environment. The analyst notes that, while in the midst of an economic downturn, BedBath&Beyond’s sales and operating margins are enviable, “the company’s management has the best sales and cost control capabilities of any company we know, although it should be criticized for occasionally failing to communicate with investors.” Before Bagchi upgraded BedBath&Beyond’s rating on Tuesday this week, the company announced that it had lowered its expectations for earnings per share for the third quarter, with a new range of 31 to 35 cents, compared to the original range of 41 to 47 cents. The new forecast is significantly lower than the current consensus expectation of 40 cents per share among Wall Street analysts. BedBath&Beyond noted that comparable-store sales in the third quarter, which measure sales at stores open for at least one year, could fall by 5.6% year over year. As of 2:15 p.m. ET on Friday (3:15 a.m. Saturday Beijing time), the BedBath&Beyond stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose 77 cents to $23.63, up 3.4%.

考研政治辅导：细说邓三概论复习要点在考研政治考查的6门课程中，邓小平理论和三个代表重要思想概论处于承上启下的中心地位，直接或间接体现邓小平理论和三个代表重要思想概论的考分要占50%以上，2008年的考试大纲变化也主要体现在这部分。因此，单就考试范围而言，重点课程当然是邓小平理论和三个代表重要思想概论。这部分内容有两个突出的特点：一是它有很强的实践性，各个章节和相应的各知识点，涉及到我国社会主义现代化建设的各个主要方面，要求考生以邓小平理论为指南，分析说明我国实现社会经济政治生活中的一系列重大问题、热点现象某认识和把握改革开放以来我国在经济基础和上层建筑所出现的许多重大变革和发展；二是它有很强的政策性，对本部分个章节和相应知识点的理解和把握，几乎都涉及现阶段我们党和政府的重大方针政策，对这些重大方针政策的理解和把握，是考生学好这部分内容并在应考时候能够做到理论联系实际的关键。从上述特点出发，考生在学习“邓小平理论”这部分的内容时，应着重注意把握以下几个环节：(1)通过复习熟记邓小平理论的基本内容，把基本常识、基本概念搞清楚，即可应对该部分的选择题。因为此部分的选择题多比较直观，从总体上说不是很难，只要复习全面就能做到判断标准。(2)要特别注重理论联系实际。考生应结合考试大纲中的有关知识点，了解和把握我国改革开放以来出现的一系列重大问题、热点现象，以及我们在改革、开放和发展等方面所做出的一系列重要举措。因为对这部分内容的考查，在政治考研试卷中往往更多地采取分析论述题、分析材料提灯主观性试题的形式，而题目给出的材料往往都是我们现实社会经济政治生活的现象和问题。所以，考生在复习备考过程中，就应当结合个章节内容关注现实生活，了解现实生活中的那些重大问题、热点现象产生的原因、背景，以及矛盾的焦点所在，并有意识地培养训练自己用正确理论观点分析说明这些现象和问题的能力。(3)要结合各章节内容的学习，注意了解和把握与之有关的中央文件的精神，认真学习以胡锦涛为总书记的党中央提出的以科学发展为统领和主题的关于发展的一系列战略思想。如中共十六届五中全会关于“十一五”规划建议中的一些新观点、新思想、新论断等，这些战略思想极可能成为命题方向、中心和重点。(4)要注意学科之间的交叉和融会贯通。《邓论》所阐述的多是我们现实经济、政治和社会生活中的重大问题、热点问题，对这些问题往往既可以用《邓论》中的观点和原理来分析，也可以用《政经》、《哲学》等学科的观点和原理来分析。因此，考生在复习《邓论》的有关内容时，应特别注意学科之间的融会贯通，即在平时就有针对性地尝试用《政经》、《哲学》中的原理，来分析《邓论》中涉及的重大现实、热点问题。唯有如此，才能更好地应对政治考研试卷中那些要求综合运用多学科知识来回答的主观性试题。	邓,邓三,邓小平,胡锦涛,邓论	正向	"Postgraduate Political Science Tutoring: Detailed Explanation of the Review Points of Deng's Three General Theories in Political Science for Postgraduate Entrance Examination, among the six courses examined in Political Science for Postgraduate Entrance Examination, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the General Theory of the Three Represents are in the central position of carrying forward the past and opening up the future, and the scores of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the General Theory of the Three Represents should account for more than 50%, and the changes in the examination outline in 2008 were mainly reflected in this part. Thus, in terms of the scope of the examination, the key courses are of course the General Introduction to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Important Thought of the Three Represents. This part has two prominent features: one is its strong practicality, each chapter and the corresponding knowledge points involve in the various main aspects of socialist modernization construction in our country, requiring candidates to analyze and explain a series of major issues, hot phenomena in social, economic and political life, and to recognize and grasp the many major changes and developments in economic base and superstructure that have occurred in our country since the reform and opening up; the other is its strong policy orientation, the understanding and grasp of each chapter and corresponding knowledge points in this part almost all involve in the major guidelines and policies of our Party and government at this stage, the understanding and grasp of these major guidelines and policies is the key to candidates to learn this part well and to be able to link theory with practice in the examination. Based on the above characteristics, candidates should focus on the following aspects when studying the content of ""Deng Xiaoping Theory"": (1) Through review, memorize the basic content of Deng Xiaoping Theory, clarify the basic knowledge and basic concepts, and can cope with the choice questions of this part. Because the questions in this part are mostly intuitive, in general, they are not very difficult, as long as you review comprehensively, you can achieve the standard of judgment. (2) pay special attention to linking theory with practice. Examinees should combine the relevant knowledge points in the examination outline to understand and grasp a series of major issues and hot phenomena that have appeared in our country since the reform and opening up, as well as a series of important measures we have taken in reform, opening up and development. Because of the examination of this part, political postgraduate entrance examination papers often take the form of analytical argumentative questions and subjective questions based on analysis of materials, and the materials given in the questions are often phenomena and problems in our real social, economic and political life. So, during the review and preparation process, candidates should combine the content of each chapter to pay attention to real life, understand the reasons, background, and focal points of major issues and hot phenomena in real life, and consciously cultivate and train their ability to analyze and explain these phenomena and issues with correct theoretical viewpoints. (3) Pay attention to the spirit of the central documents related to each chapter, and study in depth the series of strategic ideas about development proposed by the CPC Central Committee with Hu Jintao as its General Secretary, which are centered on and themed around scientific development. Some new ideas, new thoughts, and new conclusions in the proposals of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixteenth Central Committee on the ""Eleventh Five-Year Plan"" may become the direction, center, and focus of the questions. (4) Attention should be paid to the cross and integration between disciplines. What The Deng Theory expounds on are mostly major issues and hot issues in our current economic, political and social life, and these issues can often be analyzed with the views and principles of The Deng Theory, as well as the views and principles of disciplines such as Political Economy and Philosophy. Therefore, when candidates review the relevant content of Deng's theory, they should pay special attention to the integration and penetration between disciplines, that is, to try to analyze the major practical and hot issues involved in Deng's theory by using the principles of Political Economy and Philosophy in their daily studies. Only in this way can we better answer the subjective questions in the political postgraduate entrance examination paper that require the comprehensive application of multidisciplinary knowledge."

世锦赛之最：菲尔普斯被谁抢风头泳坛朗哥最悲壮新浪体育讯　本届大赛在破纪录大放卫星的“盛景”下落幕，可说的话题绝不会少，在这里选出部分有些趣味的“某某之最”评选，以飨读者。最大的赢家虽然在200自上输给了德国人比德尔曼，但菲尔普斯并没有因此变成“地球人”，五块金牌依然奠定他游坛第一人的崇高地位。他在200蝶上的巨大优势是他人难以企及的，而100蝶上勇胜卡维奇更是经典一幕，让他在北京奥运会该项上落下的争议就此划上句号，这次的胜负可是肉眼都能看得出。而三个集体项目，菲尔普斯也贡献了自己的力量，尤其在今年大赛最后一项4乘100混合泳上，他在最拿手的100蝶上，帮助美国队彻底拉开了和其他对手的距离。最大的看点这次无可非议被泳衣抢去了最大风头，韩老师说得好，穿上这衣服，人人都可以当鱼雷，谁不破纪录拿冠军真是羞耻的事，高科技衣服让国际泳联做出了来年1月1日就必须废止的决定。另外这衣服还特别容易破，男选手豁得出去，光着腚也要毫不犹豫跳下去，还能让相机抓拍到自己弧度漂亮的“散热沟”，女选手那可就惨多了。差距最小的决赛如果要评最激烈的争夺，那选择可多了去，但要选差距最小的决赛成绩，只有男子200米蛙泳，匈牙利选手格尤尔塔不声不响，在最后50米时发起冲刺，赶上了此前大幅度领先的尚蒂，最后格尤尔塔以百分之一秒的优势胜出，让尚蒂这个“泳坛阿壮”徒呼奈何！最黑的黑马本届比赛虽然意外的冠军不少，但要说意外中的意外，非德国人比德尔曼莫属，一个在北京奥运会还是200自第5，400自第17的只能说是实力派的选手，竟然在本届大赛上连续打破两项世界纪录，尤其是200自不仅战胜了菲尔普斯，更是把“菲鱼”保持的世界纪录提高了近一秒！现在人们终于相信：北京奥运会后他在短池上曾经创造了200自世界纪录，敢情就是为了今日破长池纪录提前热身一把的！至于他如何能在一年内提高成绩如此之快，肯定他训练刻苦外，高科技衣服的帮助也已经成为公认事实。最年轻的和最老的游泳这行当，80后哪怕是89年12月31日出生的，也绝对不是新人，70后真可以退休当教练了，60后还有的话，只能感慨世界真奇妙，但偏偏还是有60后的人参加，她就是让人肃然起敬的妈妈级选手、67年4月15日出生的美国自由泳选手塔拉-托雷斯，她在最后一日结束的女子50自决赛中获得第八，42岁的选手在一批20岁最后的后生小子竞争的舞台上获得第八，艰辛程度可想而知。那么最年轻的是谁？是97年2月4日出生的戈里-科特查，她来自坦桑尼亚，参加100米自由泳比赛，两人差距远达30岁！破得最疯狂的世界纪录本届大赛选手们43次打破31项世界纪录，赛会纪录更是不值一提，从预赛开始这个赛会纪录就象陶器一样脆弱，在其中最容易破的纪录只能属于男子800米自由泳，张琳把原纪录竟然提高了6秒53！佩金斯94年创造7分46秒00的纪录，随后经过索普两次破纪录，再到05年哈克特以7分38秒65创造新纪录时，11年的时间800米时间才缩短了7秒多，而张琳这次用了4年之间，就让人类随时要在800米项目上进入7分30秒大关了！最痛苦的颁奖男子50米蛙泳决赛，巴西选手费利佩获得亚军，看看其他项目的颁奖台上，欧美选手，也包括中日选手，能拿到奖牌已经不错了，所以大伙都很高兴，惟独费利佩是个大例外，他表情异常痛苦地接过银牌，而后手捧着鲜花时竟然跪倒在地，号啕大哭起来，让颁奖官员和旁边的人都不知所措，其实也好理解，费利佩是该项世界纪录创造者，他脑海里想的，真的只是金牌。最“和谐”的一幕在女子1500米自由泳比赛中，意大利选手费利皮获得冠军，当然是要奏国歌升国旗，这届比赛又是在意大利罗马进行，可以想象此时的热血沸腾的情形。但估计播放唱片的机器出了问题，正当意大利人唱得正来劲时，国歌突然没声了，大伙好象在玩快闪似的，一时间仿佛被定格不动了，随后的场景让人感慨：不用重放国歌，所有的意大利人，嘴角上翘，相视一笑，这段插曲就这么过去了。(孟巍)	菲尔普斯,比德尔曼,卡维奇,韩老师,格尤尔塔,尚蒂,塔拉-托雷斯,托雷斯,戈里-科特查,张琳,佩金斯,索普,哈克特,费利佩,费利皮,孟巍	正向	"World Championships: Phelps was overshadowed by who? The most tragic Lang in the swimming field Sina Sports News The grand finale of this competition was held under the ""scene"" of breaking records, and there would certainly be a lot of topics to talk about. Here, we select some of the most interesting ""most"" in the ""part"" to satisfy the readers. The biggest winner, despite losing the 200 freestyle to German rival Bischoff, Phelps did not become a ""normal person"", and five gold medals still established his lofty status as the top swimmer in the world. His huge advantage in the 200 butterfly was beyond the reach of others, and his victory over Kavic in the 100 butterfly was a classic moment, finally putting an end to the controversy of his performance in the event at the Beijing Olympics, and this time the victory was obvious to the naked eye. And in the three relay events, Phelps also contributed, especially in the last event of the championship, the 4x100 medley, where he helped the US team pull away from the other competitors in his specialty, the 100 butterfly. The biggest highlight this time can't be denied was taken by the swimsuit, which stole the show. As Mr. Han said, wearing this suit, everyone can be a torpedo, it is a shame if no one breaks the record and wins the championship. High-tech swimsuits led the International Swimming Federation to make a decision to abolish it from January 1st of next year. And the suit is also very easy to tear. Male athletes can jump without hesitation, even if they are naked, and the camera can capture the arc of the ""heat dissipation groove"" that is very beautiful. Female athletes are much worse. If the final with the smallest gap is to be selected as the most intense competition, there are many choices, but if the smallest gap in the final results is to be selected, it is only the men's 200m breaststroke, where the Hungarian athlete Gyurta quietly launched a sprint in the last 50 meters, catching up with Shanty, who was leading by a large margin, and finally won by a margin of one-hundredth of a second, leaving Shanty, the ""strong man of the swimming world"", helpless! The black horse with the darkest color, although there were many unexpected champions in this competition, but if we talk about the unexpected of the unexpected, it is none other than the German Biedermann. A swimmer who was only 5th in the 200m freestyle and 17th in the 400m freestyle at the Beijing Olympics, he is a power player. He actually broke two world records in this competition, especially in the 200m freestyle, not only defeating Phelps, but also raising the world record of ""Phish"" by nearly one second! Now people finally believe that he set a 200m freestyle world record in the short course at the Beijing Olympics, and it was just to warm up for today's long course record! As to how he could improve his performance so quickly in a year, apart from his hard training, it is also a recognized fact that the help of high-tech clothes has become a reality. The youngest and the oldest in swimming, even an 80s-born, even if born on December 31, 1989, is not a newcomer, the 70s can really retire and be coaches, the 60s, if there are still people, can only sigh at the wonders of the world, but there are still people from the 60s participating, she is the respected mother-level player, Tarra Torres, born on April 15, 1967, an American freestyle player, who won the 8th place in the final of the women's 50m freestyle on the last day. It can be imagined how difficult it is for a 42-year-old player to compete on the stage where a group of young lads are fighting for the last 20 years. Who is the youngest then? It is Goli-Kotcha, who was born on February 4, 1997, from Tanzania, participating in the 100m freestyle event, and the age gap between the two is as much as 30 years! The craziest world record broken in this competition, the athletes broke 31 world records 43 times, and the competition record was not worth mentioning. From the preliminary round, this competition record was as fragile as pottery, and the easiest record to break could only belong to men's 800m freestyle, where Zhang Lin broke the original record by 6.53 seconds! Perkins set the record of 7:46.00 in 1994, and then it took 11 years for Thorpe to break the record twice and for Hackett to set a new record of 7:38.65 in 2005. In that 11 years, the 800m time was shortened by more than 7 seconds, but Zhang Lin achieved this in just 4 years, bringing the human race closer to the 7:30 mark in the 800m event! The most painful men's 50m freestyle final, Brazilian athlete Felipe won the silver medal. Looking at the podiums of other events, European and American athletes, including Chinese and Japanese athletes, could already be considered a good result if they could get a medal, so everyone was very happy, except for Felipe, who was a big exception. He received the silver medal with an unusually painful expression, and then he fell to his knees and cried when he held the flowers, leaving the officials and those around him at a loss. In fact, it is easy to understand. Felipe is the world record holder of this event, and all he thinks about in his mind is the gold medal. The most harmonious scene was in the women's 1500m freestyle, where the Italian athlete Filippi won the championship, of course, the national anthem was played and the national flag was raised. This competition was held in Rome, Italy, and it can be imagined that the blood was boiling at this time. But the machine that played the records broke down, and just as the Italians were singing with great enthusiasm, the national anthem suddenly stopped, and everyone seemed to be playing a flash mob, as if they were frozen in time, and the scene that followed was touching: there was no need to replay the national anthem, all the Italians had a smile on their faces, and looked at each other, and this interlude passed.

男子办驾照途中遇车祸身亡(图)上午还接到弟弟的电话下午兄弟俩阴阳永隔没有证人，肇事司机不承认责任哥哥发帖求助：目击者，你在哪里？记者张玉东核实：A弟弟正在市二院做尸检记者根据帖子上留下的电话联系上了发帖人，他叫王申东，是死者的亲哥哥。他说，现在全家人都在第二人民医院，等待弟弟的尸检消息。下午5点，我们见到了王申东，眼睛红肿的他把我们领到医院一个草坪处。此时，全家老幼十几个人正坐在草坪上抱头痛哭。死者3岁的女儿正在妈妈的怀抱中不住眨着眼睛，她还没有意识到就此永远失去父爱。“我刚生了个儿子，上午弟弟还给我打电话道喜，没想到下午就……”王申东回忆说，11月9日下午2点多，他突然接到弟弟同事葛闯的电话，说杰春在办理驾照的途中被一辆垃圾车给撞了，不行了。怕弟妹想不开，一夜不眠“我都不敢想我是怎么把不幸的消息一个一个告诉家人的，每通电话心里都会被针刀扎一样。”王申东说，父母都在老家，母亲又有偏瘫，他一直犹豫要不要告诉二老，可是想着要让父母见上弟弟最后一面，他还是忍痛告诉了南阳唐河的二老，他们下午才赶来的，母亲已经哭昏三回。“9号那天，弟妹知道消息后，当时就昏倒了。”王申东说，怕出事，他和妻子就把弟妹和他3岁多的大女儿王芳接到了家中。“小杰、小杰……”王申东说，当晚他和妻子一夜不敢入睡，因为弟妹抱着王芳一直呼喊弟弟的名字，怕弟妹会做傻事，他和妻子在旁一直安慰到天亮。肇事司机不承认，亲戚苦寻目击者“刚刚医生说弟弟左侧肋骨断裂，如果单纯从电动车上摔下来，能摔这么重吗？”王申东说，肇事司机和垃圾车现已被警方带走处理。“司机姓魏，说他的车根本没有撞痕，事故跟他一点关系都没有。”王申东后来到现场去看了，当时垃圾车后有两米长的刹车印，“车速肯定特别快”。王申东说，当时弟弟跟同事三个人骑了三辆电动车，没有并行而是一字排开，弟弟排在最后，事发时，前面两个人听到身后“砰”的一声，弟弟已躺在了地上，没有目睹到底是撞了还是没撞，所以不能证明事故。昨天下午5点30分，我们来到了郑平路车管所向北100米处，这就是死者王杰春出事的地点。周围开的有饭店和洗车房，但王申东口中的两米长刹车痕已经找不到了。“你看又有一辆垃圾车开过来了，多快！”王申东有些愤怒地喊道。随后，我们走访了周围商铺。“我那时正在屋里吃饭，听到响声就跑了出来，看到一个光头正在给躺在地上的人掐人中，光头应该是司机。”附近居民王先生说，当时垃圾车拐到了路西侧斜着停靠，中心线附近倒着电动车和一个男子。“撞没撞我真的不敢瞎说，我毕竟没有亲眼见。”王先生和几位邻居纷纷说道。留下两个女儿，小的刚两岁“我弟弟比我有本事，全家人都靠着他。”王申东说，弟弟开了一家货运公司，已经干了七年，生意特别好，每天至少能挣500元以上。“现在没有弟弟，货运公司已经关门了，哎！好日子还没过多久，他的两个孩子以后可咋办啊。”王申东说，弟弟的两个女儿一个3岁多，一个刚2岁。随后，记者与警方取得了联系，民警说，该事故正在调查之中。“我希望那些看见事故的人，能给我打电话，帮帮我们家人，我们会永远记得的。”王申东哭了。	张玉东,王申东,葛闯,杰春,弟妹,王芳,魏,郑平,王杰春,王先生	负向	"The man died in a car accident on the way to get his driver's license (picture). He received a call from his brother in the morning, and in the afternoon, the two brothers were separated in life and death. There was no witness, and the driver of the accident did not admit responsibility. The brother posted a message for help: Witness, where are you? Journalist Zhang Yudong verified: A younger brother is undergoing an autopsy at the Second City Hospital. The poster, Wang Shendong, is the deceased's younger brother. He said that the whole family was now at the Second People's Hospital, waiting for the results of the autopsy on his brother. At 5 p.m., we met Wang Shendong, who had red and swollen eyes, and led us to a lawn in front of the hospital. At this time, more than ten people of all ages in the family were sitting on the lawn, hugging and crying. The 3-year-old daughter of the deceased was blinking incessantly in her mother's arms, and she had not yet realized that she would lose her father's love forever. ""I just had a son, and my younger brother called to congratulate me in the morning. I didn't expect it to happen in the afternoon,"" said Wang Shendong. On the afternoon of November 9, he suddenly received a call from his younger brother's colleague, Ge Chuang, who said that Jie Chun was hit by a garbage truck while applying for a driver's license and was beyond help. Afraid that my younger brothers and sisters would think of something, I didn't sleep all night ""I can't even imagine how I told the bad news to my family one by one, and every phone call would be like being stabbed with a needle and a knife."" Wang Shendong said that his parents were at home, and his mother had hemiplegia. He had always hesitated whether to tell his parents or not, but he still endured the pain to tell the parents in Tanghe, Nanyang, so that they could see his younger brother for the last time. They only arrived in the afternoon, and his mother had fainted three times from crying. On that day, 9th, when the younger brother and sister heard the news, they fainted on the spot. Wang Shendong said that, fearing something would happen, he and his wife took his younger brother’s wife and his daughter Wang Fang, who was over 3 years old, to their home. ""Xiao Jie, Xiao Jie…"" said Wang Shendong. That night, he and his wife did not dare to sleep all night, because his younger brother and sister held Wang Fang and called out the name of the younger brother. Afraid that his younger brother and sister would do something foolish, he and his wife comforted them until dawn. The driver did not admit it, and the relatives were desperately searching for eyewitnesses. ""Just now, the doctor said that my younger brother's left ribs were fractured. Could he have fallen from an electric scooter and be so seriously injured?"" Wang Shendong said that the driver of the accident and the garbage truck have been taken away by the police for handling. The driver surnamed Wei said that his car had no collision marks at all, and he had nothing to do with the accident. Wang Shendong later went to the scene and saw that there were two meters of brake marks behind the garbage truck, ""the speed must have been very fast."" Wang Shendong said that at the time, his younger brother and three colleagues rode three electric bicycles in a line, not side by side, with his younger brother at the back. At the time of the incident, the two people in front heard a ""bang"" behind them, and his younger brother was already lying on the ground. He did not see whether they were hit or not, so he could not prove the accident. At 5:30 PM yesterday, we arrived at the traffic management office 100 meters to the north of Zhengping Road, which is where Wang Jichun, the deceased, met with an accident. There are restaurants and car washes around, but Wang Shendong's two-meter-long brake marks are no longer there. Look, another garbage truck is coming, how fast! Wang Shendong shouted in anger. Then we visited the shops around. I was eating in the room at that time, and ran out when I heard the sound. I saw a bald man pressing Renzhong acupoint for the person lying on the ground, and the bald man should be the driver. Mr. Wang, a resident nearby, said that at the time, the garbage truck had turned to park obliquely on the west side of the road, and an electric bicycle and a man were lying near the center line. I really don't dare to guess whether he hit or not, after all, I didn't see it with my own eyes. Mr. Wang and several neighbors said in turn. Leave two daughters, the younger of whom is only two years old. My younger brother is more capable than me, and the whole family depends on him. Wang Shendong said that his younger brother had run a freight company for seven years, and the business was very good, earning more than 500 yuan every day. Now there is no younger brother, the freight company has closed down, ah! The good days had not lasted long, what about his two children in the future? Wang Shendong said that his younger brother had two daughters, one was more than 3 years old, and the other was just 2 years old. Then the reporter contacted the police, who said that the accident was under investigation. I hope that those who saw the accident will call us to help our family, we will always remember. Wang Shendong cried."

网上谣传“杀人信息”俩人被拘新华社电忽而在网上“预言”有杀手将在某日再度杀人，忽而言之凿凿宣称警匪枪战后“杀人狂”落网，这些“刀光剑影”的网络信息近来把很多长沙人闹得惴惴不安。长沙市公安局2日宣布，警方已从源头查获捏造“杀人信息”的一男一女，对他们分别处以行政拘留10日的处罚。“杀人犯向公安局挑战”近一年多来，长沙市南郊公园、芙蓉南路和东二环附近先后发生了枪击杀人案，犯罪分子杀人后均逃之夭夭。对此，长沙社会各界议论纷纷。11月25日前后，互联网上一些长沙本地论坛、QQ群中出现了题为“南郊公园杀人犯28号会出来杀人”的帖文。该帖文称“南郊公园杀人犯向公安局挑战，28号会出来杀人……我们银行从今天开始已经有3个便衣了。”还“提醒”市民28号不要随便出门，也不要去银行。帖文以疯狂速度传播，一些长沙市民为之胆寒。11月29日16时许，网上又开始传播声称来源于“湖南省公安厅和长沙市公安局”的消息：在长沙制造枪击案的犯罪嫌疑人落网，被捕前曾与警方发生激烈枪战，还称一民警在枪战中牺牲。消息源于公交车上听说对这些“刀光剑影”的网络消息，长沙警方澄清指均属捏造。据警方通报，经调查，“预言”杀手再度杀人的为一名证券公司员工袁某(女，22岁)；而宣称警匪枪战后“杀人狂”落网的人，则是某彩色印刷公司员工刘某某(男，23岁)。面对警方讯问，袁某称消息源于“公交车上听说”，刘某某则明确承认消息为自己亲手炮制。袁、刘二人传播消息都通过各自熟悉的QQ群，继而被其他QQ群、论坛、网站以讹传讹，最终引发社会震动。对袁、刘二人，长沙警方决定依照《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》相关规定作出行政拘留10日的处罚决定。长沙市公安局强调，南郊公园枪击案等数起恶性案件发生后，公安机关一直在全力以赴地侦查案件和追捕犯罪嫌疑人，争取尽早将其抓捕归案。一旦嫌疑人落网，将在第一时间通过主流新闻媒体向社会披露。长沙警方强调，枪击杀人案社会关注度高，市民群众以多种方式关注可以理解，但如果制造、散布谣言造成社会恐慌、扰乱正常社会秩序就属于触犯法律，警方将依法追究虚假信息制造者的法律责任。	袁某,袁,刘,刘某某	正向	"There were rumors of ""murder information"" on the Internet, and two people were detained. Xinhua News Agency, suddenly, there were rumors on the Internet that a killer would kill again on a certain day, and then it was said that the ""murderer"" was arrested after a gun battle between the police and the criminals. These ""sword and saber"" network information have recently made many Changsha people uneasy. Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau announced on February 2 that the police had apprehended a man and a woman who had fabricated ""murder information"" from the source, and imposed administrative detention of 10 days on them respectively. “the murderer challenged the public security bureau” for more than a year, in the suburbs of Changsha, south of Nanjiao Park, south of Furong South Road and east of Second Ring Road, a series of shooting murders have occurred, and the criminals all fled after killing. There was much discussion among all sectors of society in Changsha. Around November 25, posts titled ""Serial Killer No. 28 in Nanxiao Park Will Come Out to Kill"" appeared on some local forums and QQ groups in Changsha. The post said that the murderer in Nanjiao Park had challenged the Public Security Bureau, and that he would come out to kill on the 28th... Our bank has had three plainclothes officers since today. It also reminded citizens not to go out casually or to the bank on the 28th. The post spread like crazy, and some citizens of Changsha were frightened by it. At 16:00 on November 29, another online message claiming to be from the Hunan Provincial Public Security Department and Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau was spread: the suspect who committed the shooting in Changsha was arrested, and before his arrest, he had a fierce gun battle with the police, and it was also said that a police officer was killed in the gun battle. The message originated from a bus, where it was heard that the ""sword and saber"" network messages in Changsha were all fabricated by the police. According to the police report, after investigation, the ""prophecy"" killer who committed another murder was a securities company employee, Yuan Mou (female, 22 years old); and the one who claimed that the ""murderer"" was arrested after the police and criminal shootout was a staff member of a color printing company, Liu Moumou (male, 23 years old). In response to the police’s interrogation, Yuan said that he heard the news on the bus, while Liu explicitly admitted that he had fabricated the news himself. Yuan and Liu spread the information through QQ groups that they were familiar with, which was then passed on to other QQ groups, forums, and websites, eventually causing a social shock. For Yuan and Liu, the Changsha police decided to impose an administrative detention of 10 days on them in accordance with relevant provisions of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Public Security Administration Punishments. Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau stressed that after several恶性 cases, such as the Nanxiao Park shooting, the public security organs have been working hard to investigate the cases and apprehend the suspects, in order to arrest them as soon as possible. Once the suspect is apprehended, he will be disclosed to the public through mainstream media as soon as possible. Changsha police emphasized that the public attention to the shooting and killing case is high, and it is understandable for the citizens and the public to pay attention to it in various ways, but if rumors are manufactured and spread to cause social panic and disrupt normal social order, it is considered a violation of the law, and the police will pursue legal responsibility for the legal responsibility of the false information manufacturers."
国安最受诟病处有盏不老神灯他配得上称御林军队魂新浪体育讯　清新湿润的气候，山呼海啸的助威，一掷千金的奖励，豪华奢侈的阵容。一切有利条件没能为恒大带来一场预期的胜利。而面对恒大狂风暴雨般的进攻，上一轮饱受诟病的国安防线却在这个夜晚显得格外坚挺。其中，作为后防中坚的队长徐云龙居功至伟。在赛前接受采访时，徐云龙就表示“希望用我们的整体来逼抢与限制对手”。果然，全场比赛徐云龙与血性拼搏对方前锋穆里奇针锋相对。第32分钟，穆里奇禁区内得球大力抽射，徐云龙飞身阻挡却没能阻止恒大打入扳平比分的入球。然而这次失球却彻底点燃了国安队长的激情。第35分钟，徐云龙大脚长传前场，恒大解围后打出快速反击，徐云龙为了阻止对方进攻在中线附近对穆里奇犯规吃到黄牌。尽管这次判罚争议不大，徐云龙却利用自己经验向裁判表达不满。2分钟后，国安小将朴成同样因为对穆里奇的犯规得到黄牌，为年轻队友鸣不平的徐云龙险些与穆里奇相互示威险些引起冲突。第39分钟，穆里奇面对出击已经拿到球的杨智做出了附加动作，就在国安队友纷纷上前质问穆里奇的时候，徐云龙发挥了队长的作用劝慰队友并示意裁判对方犯规存在恶意，使穆里奇得到应得黄牌的同时也使比赛重新回到正常轨道。如果说上半场徐云龙的表现可以用激情四射来形容，那么下半场的徐云龙则可谓血性十足了。无论是中路稳健的头球解围与卡位抢断，还是两个边路及时的补位防守，都体现了这位老将的良好状态以及丰富的经验。尤其是比赛第80分钟，穆里奇在国安禁区内挑球过人，险些形成单刀之势，多亏徐云龙飞身倒钩解围才化解了此次险情，自己却也因为这次解围左脚受伤。而接下来发生的一幕则让国安队长出离愤怒了。在队医查看伤情的同时，抬担架的工作人员却用担架撞击了徐云龙的头部示意他赶快上担架。这一无礼举动让久经沙场的国安队长惊讶也怒不可遏，忍痛单腿跳起怒斥担架队员。而恒大前锋克莱奥却依然上前示意徐云龙诈伤拖延比赛时间。最终徐云龙还是在队医的搀扶下一瘸一拐走出场地接受了治疗。（点击观看视频）尽管被穆里奇超强的个人能力制造了不小的麻烦，难以掩盖的是徐云龙这样一位老队长在比赛中表现出的统帅能力、拼搏精神以及丰富的关键时刻丰富的比赛经验。早在赛季前的准备期，徐云龙就通过努力的训练将自己的身体状态特别是体重调整到了近年来最佳值。联想起联赛首轮对阵江苏时奋不顾身的回追封堵了对方的单刀球，我们可以看到，尽管年逾30，徐云龙在国安队的领袖地位却依然是不可动摇的，特别是在今年没有内外援补充的后卫线，徐云龙的存在就显得格外珍贵了。在为这位老将喝彩的同时，我们也不得不看到隐忧：徐云龙这样的状态还能维持几年？当老队长力不从心之时国安防线又有谁可以依赖？期待着年轻队员的尽快成长以及高水平内外援的补充，使这位国安功臣有朝一日可以放心的淡出。(非予)	徐云龙,云龙,穆里奇,朴成,杨智,克莱奥,非予	正向	The most criticized aspect of the National Security has a lamp of the immortal lamp, which deserves to be called the soul of the imperial guards. Xingqing moist climate, mountain howling sea, cheering, one thousand and one gold rewards, luxurious and luxurious team. All favorable conditions failed to bring a victory as expected to the Evergrande. And while the Evergrande team was raining down attack after attack, the defense of Guoan, which had been criticized in the previous match, stood firm on this night. Among them, the team captain Xu Yulong, as the backbone of the back defense, deserves the greatest credit. In the pre-match interview, Xu Yulong said that he hoped to use our team to press and restrict the opponent. Indeed, in the whole match, Xu Yulong struggled with the forward player Muriqui of the opposing team in a bloodthirsty manner. In the 32nd minute, Muriqui received the ball in the penalty area and shot powerfully, but Xu Yulong, who dived to block, could not prevent the goal that equalized the score from being scored by the Evergrande. However, this goal loss ignited the passion of the captain of Guoan completely. In the 35th minute, Xu Yulong delivered a long pass to the front field. After the Huangpeng team cleared the ball, they launched a quick counterattack. Xu Yulong fouled Muriqui near the midfield to stop his attack and was shown a yellow card. Although the punishment was not controversial, Xu Yulong expressed dissatisfaction to the referee with his experience. Two minutes later, young player Puskong of Guoan also received a yellow card for fouling Muriqui. Xu Yulong, who was trying to make a fuss for his young teammate, almost provoked Muriqui and caused a conflict. In the 39th minute, Muriqui made an additional action when he faced Yang Zhi who had already got the ball. Just as the Guoan teammates rushed forward to question Muriqui, Xu Yulong played the role of the team captain to comfort his teammates and indicated to the referee that the opponent had committed a foul with malice, which allowed Muriqui to get the deserved yellow card and also brought the game back to the normal track. If Xu Yulong’s first half was described as passionate, the second half was full of fighting spirit. Whether it is the steady header clearance and card position interception in the middle, or the timely defensive support on both sides, it reflects the good condition and rich experience of this veteran. Especially in the 80th minute of the match, Murich dribbled inside the Dalian Sinopac area, almost forming a one-on-one situation. Xu Yulong cleared the danger with a flying backheel, but he was injured in his left foot while clearing the danger. And what followed next made the captain of the security team furious. While the team doctor was examining the injury, the staff who were carrying the stretcher hit Xu Yulong's head with the stretcher to indicate that he should get on the stretcher quickly. This impolite act surprised and infuriated the long-serving captain of the national security team, who hopped on one leg in pain and scolded the stretcher bearers angrily. But the Evergrande striker, Claudio, still went forward to indicate to Xu Yulong that he was faking an injury to delay the game. Finally, Xu Yulong hobbled out of the field with the help of the team doctor for treatment. (Click to watch the video) Despite the great trouble caused by Mulari's super individual ability, it is difficult to conceal the commanding ability, fighting spirit and rich match experience of Xu Yulong, an old team leader, in the match. Even before the preparation period of the season, Xu Yulong adjusted his physical condition, especially his weight, to the best level in recent years through hard training. Recalling the fearless interception of the opponent's one-on-one shot in the first round of the league against Jiangsu, we can see that, despite being over 30, Xu Yulong's leadership position in the Guoan team is still unshakable, especially in the back line without domestic and foreign reinforcements this year, Xu Yulong's existence is particularly precious. While applauding the veteran, we can't help but see the worry: how many more years can Xu Yulong maintain such a state? Who can rely on to defend the country's security when the old captain is no longer up to the task? Looking forward to the quick growth of young players and the addition of high-level domestic and foreign players, so that this former hero of Guoan can one day relax and step out. (Not given)

魔兽交接停服15天网游厂商争夺500万玩家每经记者任思强发自北京2009年6月7日，已在中国运营近5年的《魔兽世界》将迎来停服日。值得关注的是，在《魔兽世界》7日凌晨关闭全部服务器后，数量达500万之巨的魔兽玩家至少在半个月内处于无游戏可玩的状态——一场围绕着“魔兽”玩家展开的15日争夺战即将上演。争夺500万魔兽玩家据了解，在《魔兽世界》6月7日停服日来临前夕，网易已经从九城手中拿到了《魔兽世界》全部数据。5月31日，九城发布公告，首次就《魔兽世界》易主事件做出明确表态，称九城运营的《魔兽世界》将于2009年6月7日凌晨0时起终止服务，玩家点卡款项返还工作将于6月7日启动。同一天，网易方面表示，网易《魔兽世界》服务器将全部采用新的设备，网易和暴雪双方计划在6月下旬开放第一批服务器，并在几周内开放其他全部服务器。这意味着，数量达500万之巨的魔兽玩家至少在半个月内处于无游戏可玩的状态。针对这一空档，其他的网游厂商开始发力抢占市场。日前，金山软件宣布，《剑侠情缘网络版叁》(以下简称《剑网3》)将于6月10日启动百万玩家“极限封测”，邀请百万玩家参与测试，玩家可于6月5日起申请测试资格体验游戏。金山此次大规模放号，正值《魔兽世界》数据交接之际，抢占真空期的意图明显。此前，蓝港在线董事长兼CEO王峰公布了公司2009年战略布局，旗下三款网络游戏《问鼎》、《西游记》和《佣兵天下》将抢占市场份额。除此外，巨人游戏的掌门人史玉柱也在寻找《征途》的继任者，搜狐的张朝阳与畅游CEO王韬正在考虑《天龙八部》的后续产品，而盛大陈天桥早就给《永恒之塔》贴上了“韩国版魔兽”的标签。“实际上，盛大提前推出《永恒之塔》，就是为了拉拢对游戏画面效果要求较高的魔兽玩家，而即将在今年第二季度面市的金山《剑网3》也是魔兽玩家的有力争夺者。”一位在网游业工作多年的业内人士告诉《每日经济新闻》记者，《魔兽世界》消失的15天，必将是其他网游竞争最激烈的15天。新一轮PK即将展开《魔兽世界》的易主会给网游业带来什么样的变化？昨日，易观国际网络游戏分析师黄超在接受《每日经济新闻》采访时称，《魔兽世界》的易主在短期内不会出现对整个市场环境产生过大影响，但2009年对于中国网络游戏市场颇为特殊，也使得行业充满不定因素。“由于魔兽世界在中国出现空档期，2009年对于中国网络游戏公司以及国外厂商都是一个机遇，除了《永恒之塔》、《剑网3》之外，海外游戏厂商EA和暴雪的《星际争霸二》也将登陆中国市场。”黄超称。与此同时，对于刚刚签下“魔兽”网易来说，最新财报上的数字或许并不会太出色。“从目前来看，网易需要收购九城手中的点卡，并补偿停机费用。另外按照与暴雪的协议规定，需投入大量最新服务器搭建架构，前期成本可想而知。”黄超表示。分析人士认为，九城在失去“魔兽”之后将迎来转型期，这段时期难以找回之前的市场份额；盛大在推出《永恒之塔》后，可能将逐步拉开和竞争对手的差距；腾讯凭借《地下城与勇士》以及多款成功产品，将稳固当前的位置；由于网易《魔兽世界》将于4季度正式完成商业化运营，加上《天龙八部》的稳定收入(注：此处应为《梦幻西游》，《天龙八部》不是网易运营)，前三名的位置不会有太大改变。但该分析人士表示，“网易能否凭借《魔兽世界》在年内赶超盛大、腾讯，现在不好预测。”易观国际发布的《2009年第一季度中国网络市场季度检测》数据显示，由于用户增长，2009年第一季度中国网络游戏市场收入规模达55.14亿元，环比增长达8.3%。上季度，九城市场份额滑落，将第四名的位置让给了搜狐畅游。黄超表示，这主要是由于九城的《巫妖王之怒》审批推迟，造成玩家上线积极性下降；而搜狐畅游凭借《天龙八部》，用户形成了持续增长。国内网游格局，已经到了瞬息万变的局面。业界观察：平台化成网游发展趋势每经记者任思强发自北京“魔兽风波”尘埃落定后，网易手握《大话西游》、《魔兽世界》及《星际争霸2》等数款大作，横跨自主研发和代理两大纵区，俨然成为最宽广的网游运营平台。多方分析也认为，门户网的优势和多年成功运营经验是网易此番胜出的重要原因。平台化是网游产业近年发展的新趋势，它是指一家厂商或多家厂商联合，将自身拥有的各种资源整合起来为一款产品服务。相较于传统的运营模式，平台化协调统一了各方力量，故能形成强大的合力，从而实现效率最大化。2009年年初，金山和盛大联合运营《剑侠世界》、《剑网2》，此后盛大又相继与蓝港在线、千橡互动、联众世界等厂商签订了联合运营协议。随着这一系列联合运营的掀起，金山等自主研发能力出众的厂商开始向网游研发平台发展，盛大等厂商则向网游运营平台转型，平台化渐成主流。实际上，此番《魔兽世界》易主也带有强烈的平台化特色，九城的运营平台与网易虽然不可相提并论，但其密谋代理《剑侠情缘网络版叁》的举动也透露出借力金山研发平台来弥补损失的想法。本报之前曾报道，九城总裁陈晓薇此前造访金山位于珠海的西山居开发工作室。业内人士普遍认为，此次陈晓薇与金山董事长兼CEO求伯君进行对话，主要是谈与金山今年重量级的网游产品《剑侠情缘网络版叁》的合作计划。分析人士预测，“魔兽风波”余波未了，网游厂商将掀起更大规模的竞争狂潮，而最终决定胜负的还是各款产品所依托的平台强弱。	任思强,王峰,史玉柱,张朝阳,王韬,陈天桥,黄超,陈晓薇,求伯君	正向	"World of Warcraft, which has been operating in China for nearly 5 years, will have a shutdown day on June 7, 2009. Game publishers are competing for 5 million players. Every Jing reporter Ren Siqiang, Beijing. Notably, after the World of Warcraft closed all its servers at 7 am on the morning of July 7, at least 5 million World of Warcraft players will be in a state of no games to play for half a month or more – a 15-day battle for the ""World of Warcraft"" players will soon be staged. For the 5 million World of Warcraft players, it is understood that before the shutdown of World of Warcraft on June 7, NetEase has already taken over all the data of World of Warcraft from Netease. On May 31, 9城 announced its first clear statement on the ownership change of World of Warcraft, stating that the service of World of Warcraft operated by 9city will be terminated at 0:00 on June 7, 2009, and the return of player card fees will be launched on June 7. On the same day, NetEase said that all NetEase World of Warcraft servers would adopt new equipment, and both NetEase and Blizzard planned to open the first batch of servers in mid-June, and open all other servers in a few weeks. This means that at least 5 million players of the魔兽 game will be unable to play any games for half a month. Taking advantage of this gap, other online game companies began to launch to capture the market. Recently, Kingsoft announced that the ""Jianxian 3"" (short for ""Jian3"") will launch a ""limit test"" for one million players on June 10, inviting one million players to participate in the test. Players can apply for test qualifications to experience the game starting from June 5. Jinshan's large-scale number release coincides with the data handover of World of Warcraft, and its intention to seize the vacuum period is obvious. Previously, Wang Feng, chairman and CEO of Lan Hong Online, announced the company's strategic layout for 2009, and the three online games under its umbrella, ""Questioning the Apex"", ""Journey to the West"", and ""Mercenary World"", will seize the market share. In addition, Shi Yuzhu, the boss of Giant Interactive, is also looking for a successor for “Triumphant March”, while Zhang Yang of Sohu and Wang Tao, the CEO of Zhihu, are considering the follow-up products of “The Smiling, Proud Wanderer”. Shentianqiao of Shanda has long labeled “Eternal Tower” as the “Korean version of Warcraft”. In fact, Shanda launched Everlasting Tower ahead of schedule to attract World of Warcraft players who have high requirements for game visual effects. And Kingsoft’s Sword Network 3, which will be launched in the second quarter of this year, is also a strong contender for World of Warcraft players. An insider in the online game industry told The Economic Daily News that the 15 days when World of Warcraft disappeared would definitely be the most intense 15 days of competition for other online games. The new round of PK is about to begin, what changes will the transfer of ownership of World of Warcraft bring to the online game industry? Yesterday, Huang Chao, an analyst of Online Game of iView International, said that the transfer of World of Warcraft will not have a great impact on the market environment in the short term, but 2009 is special for the Chinese online game market, which also makes the industry full of uncertain factors. Due to the gap in World of Warcraft in China, 2009 was an opportunity for Chinese online game companies and foreign manufacturers. Apart from Everlasting Tower and Sword Network 3, overseas game manufacturers EA and Blizzard's Starcraft II will also enter the Chinese market. Huang Chao said. Meanwhile, for NetEase, which just signed the ""Minecraft"", the figures on the latest financial report may not be too impressive. At present, NetEase needs to acquire the points cards held by 91 Wireless and compensate for the downtime fees. According to the agreement with Blizzard, a large number of the latest servers need to be built, and the前期 cost is beyond imagination. ""According to Huang Chao,"" Analysts believe that 9 City will enter a transformation period after losing ""World of Warcraft"", which is difficult to recover the previous market share; Shanda may gradually pull away from competitors after launching ""Eternal Tower""; Tencent will consolidate its current position with ""Dungeon and Fighter"" and several successful products; Due to the official commercial operation of ""World of Warcraft"" by NetEase in the fourth quarter, as well as the stable income of ""The Legend of the Dragon"" (Note: it should be ""Dwelling of the Dragon"", ""The Legend of the Dragon"" is not operated by NetEase), the positions of the top three will not change much. But the analyst said it was hard to predict whether NetEase could overtake Shanda and Tencent with World of Warcraft within the year. The data from the ""2009 Q1 China Internet Market Quarterly Monitoring"" released by Analysys International shows that the revenue scale of China's online game market in the first quarter of 2009 reached 5.514 billion yuan, with a ring growth of 8.3% due to user growth. Last quarter, Sohu’s share of the market fell, and it was replaced by Sohu’s Changyou in fourth place. Huang Chao said that this was mainly due to the delay in the approval of World of Warcraft by 9 City, which led to a decline in the enthusiasm of players to log in, while Sohu's Tianlong Baixue formed a continuous growth in users. The domestic online game landscape has become a situation of constant change. Industry observation: Platformization has become the development trend of online games. Ren Siqiang, a journalist from Jinji, Beijing. After the ""World of Warcraft""风波dust has settled, NetEase holds several major works such as ""Journey to the West"", ""World of Warcraft"" and ""StarCraft II"", spanning the two verticals of self-developed and agency, and has become the widest online game operation platform. Multi-party analysis also believes that the advantages and years of successful operation experience of portal websites are important reasons for NetEase's victory this time. Platformization is a new trend in the development of online games industry in recent years, which refers to a manufacturer or multiple manufacturers joining together to integrate various resources they own to serve a product. Compared with traditional operating models, platform coordination unifies the forces of all parties, thus forming a powerful synergy to achieve maximum efficiency. At the beginning of 2009, Kingsoft and盛大jointly operated Sword and the World and Sword and the Net 2. After that, Shanda successively signed joint operation agreements with Blue Harbour Online, Qianru Interactive, and Union World. With the rise of this series of joint operations, manufacturers with strong independent research and development capabilities, such as Kingsoft, began to develop into online game R&D platforms, while manufacturers such as Suning shifted to online game operation platforms, and platformization has gradually become mainstream. In fact, this transfer of World of Warcraft also has a strong platform feature. Although the operation platform of 9 City is not comparable to that of NetEase, its plot to act as the agent of Sword and Fairy Online 3 also reveals the idea of relying on Kingsoft's development platform to make up for the loss. As previously reported, Chen Xiaowei, the president of Nine City, visited the Xi Shan Ju development studio in Zhuhai, Kingsoft's location. It is generally believed that the dialogue between Chen Xiaowei and Qiu Baojun, chairman and CEO of Kingsoft, is mainly about the cooperation plan of Sword and Fairy Online III, Kingsoft's heavyweight online game this year. Analysts predict that the aftershocks of the ""Minecraft Storm"" have not yet ended, and online game manufacturers will launch a more intense competition, and the final winner will still depend on the strength of the platform on which each product relies."
谢旭人：要把稳定物价总水平放在更加突出位置人民网北京3月7日电(人民网前方报道组)今日14：30，十一届全国人大四次会议新闻中心举行主题为“财政政策和有关问题”的记者会。财政部部长谢旭人在会上表示，要把稳定物价总水平放在更加突出的位置。谢旭人表示，今年中央决定实施积极的财政政策，这是中国政府在全面分析当前国内国际经济环境变化的基础上做出的一个重大决策。当前世界经济尽管在逐步复苏，但是复苏的基础还不够牢固，不确定性、不稳定性还存在。我国经济要保持平稳较快的发展，也需要应对这些影响，还需要必要的政策支持。谢旭人说，与此同时，我们近几年为应对国际金融危机的冲击增加了公共投资，有不少在建的项目还需要继续增加投入。今年又是“十二五”规划的开局之年，有计划地启动“十二五”规划重大项目，加强经济社会发展的薄弱环节，进一步提高保障和改善民生的水平，这些都需要加大财政投入，所以要继续实施积极的财政政策。谢旭人说，落实好这个财政政策，要更加积极稳妥地处理好保持经济平稳较快发展，调整经济结构与管理好通货膨胀预期的关系，而且要把稳定物价总水平放在更加突出的位置。谢旭人说，今年财政预算赤字占GDP的比重进一步下降，预算赤字比去年减少1500亿元，全国财政赤字占GDP的比重，去年是2.5%，今年可望进一步下降到2%左右。与此同时，在财政政策实施过程中，我们更加注重在调整经济结构、提高经济发展的质量和效益，切实保障和改善民生方面下更大的工夫。按照要把稳定价格总水平放在更加突出的位置上这一要求，我们在财政政策的过程中，大力支持和促进诸如粮食、棉花、蔬菜、糖料、肉类、肉禽蛋奶等人民生活必需品的生产和供应。进一步清理、规范流通领域各种收费，进一步做好促进化肥、农药、薄膜等农用生产资料的供应以及价格的管理，促进增加这些方面的供应。	谢旭人	正向	"Xie Xuren: We should give more prominence to stabilizing the overall price level. People's Daily Online, Beijing, March 7 (People's Daily Online front-line reporting group) - At 14:30 today, the press conference on ""fiscal policy and related issues"" was held at the press center of the Fourth Session of the Eleventh National People's Congress. Finance Minister Xie Xuren said at the meeting that stabilizing the overall price level should be given a more prominent position. Xie Xuren said that the central government has decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy this year, which is a major decision made by the Chinese government after a comprehensive analysis of the changes in the current domestic and international economic environment. The current world economy, although recovering gradually, is still not solid, and uncertainty and instability still exist. For China's economy to maintain steady and rapid growth, it also needs to address these impacts and requires necessary policy support. Xie said that at the same time, in response to the impact of the international financial crisis in recent years, we have increased public investment, and there are many ongoing projects that still need to be increased in investment. This year is the opening year of the 12th Five-Year Plan. To start the major projects of the 12th Five-Year Plan in an orderly manner, to strengthen the weak links in economic and social development, and to further improve the level of ensuring and improving people’s livelihood, all of these require increased fiscal investment, so it is necessary to continue to implement an active fiscal policy. Xie said that to implement this fiscal policy, we should handle the relationship between maintaining steady and rapid economic growth, adjusting the economic structure, and managing inflation expectations more actively and steadily, and we should also place greater emphasis on stabilizing the overall price level. Xie said that the proportion of the fiscal deficit to GDP would further decline this year, and the fiscal deficit would be reduced by 150 billion yuan compared to last year. The proportion of the national fiscal deficit to GDP last year was 2.5%, and it is expected to further decline to around 2% this year. Meanwhile, in the implementation of fiscal policy, we will focus more on adjusting the economic structure, improving the quality and efficiency of economic development, and making greater efforts to ensure and improve people’s livelihood. In response to the requirement to place greater emphasis on stabilizing the overall price level, we have supported and promoted the production and supply of essential goods for people's livelihood, such as food, cotton, vegetables, sugar, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, in the process of fiscal policy. Further clean up and standardize various charges in the circulation field, and further do a good job in promoting the supply of agricultural production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and films, as well as price management, to promote an increase in supply in these areas."

女医生赴川救灾被辞退向单位索赔210万汶川地震后，重庆女医生娄继英旷工去灾区服务三天，被医院按“自动离职”处理，一时间在网络上引起巨大反响。南京一名女子有着跟娄继英同样的遭遇。她姓姜，是南京搜房网市场部的工作人员。因为被灾区的惨状所牵动，她在单位没有批准的情况下赴川赈灾，回来后遭到辞退。姜女士无法接受解聘决定，在她看来，自己擅自离岗的行为在救灾期间就已得到单位认可——她在灾区一直以单位志愿者自居，而单位也一直将她作为正面典型进行宣传。然而公司并没有为此改变决策，最近大半年来，她一直在维权。记者昨天获悉，她已经起诉单位，索赔各项赔偿金及加班工资合计200多万元。南京玄武区法院刚刚受理此案。与三名志愿者一同去救灾姜女士原本是南京搜房网市场部的一名工作人员。在接受记者采访时，她表示，汶川特大地震发生后，她每天不管工作有多忙，都要抽空上网、看电视，关注救援进展情况。“但是了解得越多，心就揪得越紧。”灾区满目疮痍，到处是生离死别，屋漏偏逢连夜雨，伤者躺在雨水中……看着这一幕幕的惨状，姜女士怎么也止不住眼泪，她产生了一种强烈的想法：到灾区去！做一点力所能及的事帮助他们！去年5月14日晚上，她给公司领导发了条短信，请求前往灾区，但没有得到准许。“我一夜都没闭眼，灾区的惨状一直在脑中回旋。”姜女士说，因为心情太迫切，紧接着她又找过领导两次，但领导还是不太支持，说她工作太忙，没时间去做志愿者。尽管协商未果，姜女士还是不愿放弃。她一方面抓紧安排手头的工作，另一方面将赴灾区做志愿者的想法与几个客户进行了沟通，并得到他们的积极响应。5月17日下午5点，她毅然与其他三名志愿者乘坐飞机抵达灾区。公司一直“正面宣传”到达灾区后，姜女士跟同伴们立即投身到救灾工作中去。5月19日，了解到灾区帐篷告急，姜女士第一时间与南京方面取得联系，紧急征调了一批帐篷；20日，帮助某开发商联系捐建希望小学事宜……他们跑遍了都江堰、什邡、汶川、映秀等重灾区，做了很多工作。“我始终以搜房网志愿者自居，我是代表公司参与赈灾。”姜女士说，她在灾区时一直跟公司保持密切联系，先后发回大量文字、照片、DV短片，这些鲜活的资料都出现在公司网站的报道中。如今，姜女士已将这些报道打印下来作为证据，还进行了公证。昨天在法院，记者看到，在该网站2008年5月18日的报道《灾区紧急动员令》一文中，第一段开头写道：“由南京搜房发起的奔赴四川灾区的志愿者队伍一行四人，于17日下午5点乘飞机抵达成都。这支志愿者队伍包括南京搜房姜×……”而其他报道中，也多次出现“搜房志愿者”、“唯一的女性队员姜×”等字眼。“看到公司在报道中这样称呼我，我心里的石头放下了。”姜女士认为，公司将她作为抗灾正面典型加以宣传，是认可她到灾区做志愿者的意思。一回来就收到解聘通知然而，姜女士无论如何也没想到，她5月28日早上一赶到单位就被领导叫去谈话。领导指责她不打招呼就擅自离岗，并表示不再欢迎她回来上班。几天后，她收到了解聘通知。“救灾不能作为违反公司规章制度的借口。”该公司一位负责人表示，从道义上来讲，姜女士去灾区做志愿者是值得称道的，但作为一名公司职员，她出发前没有得到批准，领导也没签字同意，属于严重违反劳动纪律的行为。根据该公司的规章制度，旷工三天就视为自动离职，姜女士都已经旷工七天了，情况比较严重，解除劳动合同是合理的。员工认为救灾是职务行为姜女士无法接受单位的解聘决定。她认为，单位网站的报道，事实上已经认可她组织的志愿者团队为搜房志愿者分队，认可她本人搜房志愿者的身份，同时还采用了她从抗灾前线发回的图文，这就意味着，她在灾区工作的行为属于职务行为。因此，单位以旷工为由与她解除劳动关系是没有事实与法律依据的。“即便不谈法理，但从情感上，公司做的也说不过去。”姜女士认为，自己代表公司在灾区做志愿者，事实上也给公司带来了好的影响。记者昨天下午致电南京搜房网，公司一位负责人表示，将在庭审中出具证据批驳姜女士的观点。状告公司索赔210多万去年6月，姜女士向南京市玄武区劳动争议仲裁委员会提起仲裁，要求公司继续履行劳动合同。后因仲裁审理期限已过，她书面申请终止仲裁，并在今年3月底向南京市玄武区法院提起诉讼。这次，她不再要求公司继续履行劳动合同，而是提出了巨额索赔，包括83.4万违法解约赔偿金，41.7万的解除劳动合同经济补偿金，以及20余万的额外补偿金。并要求单位支付其未发工资、业务提成、加班工资合计74万余元等。陈珊珊	娄继英,姜,姜女士,姜×,陈珊珊	正向	"A female doctor was dismissed and claimed 2.1 million yuan from her unit after going to Sichuan for disaster relief. After the Wenchuan earthquake, female doctor Lou Jiying from Chongqing went to the disaster area for three days of service, and was dismissed by the hospital as ""voluntary resignation"", which caused a huge response on the Internet. A woman in Nanjing had the same experience as Lou Jiying. She surnames Jiang and is a staff member of the Marketing Department of Sohu Nanjing. Moved by the sight of the disaster area, she went to Sichuan to help in relief efforts without her unit's approval and was fired after her return. Ms. Jiang could not accept the decision to dismiss her. In her view, her act of leaving her post without permission had already been recognized by the unit during the disaster relief period. She had always regarded herself as a volunteer of the unit in the disaster area, and the unit had always promoted her as a positive role model. However, the company did not change its decision for this. She has been fighting for her rights for the past half a year. The reporter learned from yesterday that she has sued her unit for more than 20 million yuan in various compensation and overtime wages. The Nanjing Xuanwu District Court has just accepted this case. Together with three volunteers, she went to the disaster relief. Ms. Jiang originally worked in the market department of Nanjing Sohu. When interviewed by the journalists, she said that after the Wenchuan earthquake, no matter how busy her work was, she would take time to surf the Internet and watch TV to pay attention to the progress of the rescue. But the more I know, the tighter my heart is pulled. The disaster area was in ruins, with scenes of separation and death everywhere. The injured were lying in the rainwater... Looking at this scene, Ms. Jiang could not stop crying. She had a strong desire to go to the disaster area! Do something within your power to help them! On the evening of May 14 last year, she sent a text message to her company's leadership requesting to go to the disaster area, but did not receive permission. I did not sleep all night, and the tragic scenes in the disaster area kept revolving in my mind. Ms. Jiang said that because she was too eager to do so, she had approached her boss twice more, but the boss was still not supportive, saying that she was too busy with work to have time to do volunteer work. Though the negotiation failed, Ms. Jiang was unwilling to give up. On one hand, she made every effort to arrange the work at hand, and on the other hand, she communicated her idea of volunteering in the disaster area to several customers, and received their active response. At 5:00 p.m. on May 17, she resolutely boarded a plane with three other volunteers to reach the disaster area. After the company had been “promoting” the disaster-stricken areas, Ms. Jiang and her companions immediately threw themselves into the rescue work. On May 19, Ms. Jiang contacted the Nanjing side immediately to urgently mobilize a batch of tents, as the disaster area was short of tents. On May 20, she helped a developer contact the donation and construction of a Hope Primary School. They ran around Dujiangyan, Shifang, Wenchuan, and Yingzhou, and did a lot of work in the heavily affected areas. I always consider myself a volunteer of Sohu House, and I am participating in the disaster relief on behalf of the company. Ms. Jiang said that she kept in close contact with her company during her time in the disaster area, and sent back a large number of text messages, photos, and DV short films. These lively materials appeared in the company’s reports on the website. Now, Miss Jiang has printed out these reports as evidence and had them notarized. Yesterday, at the court, the reporters saw that in the article ""Emergency Mobilization Order for the Disaster Area"" on the website on May 18, 2008, the first paragraph began with the following: ""A team of four volunteers, organized by Nanjing Sohu, arrived in Chengdu by plane at 5 p.m. on the afternoon of the 17th."" The volunteer team included Nanjing Sohu Qiang × × ×, and the term ""Sohu volunteer"" and ""the only female member Qiang × ×"" also appeared in other reports. Seeing the company refer to me in this way in the report, a stone was lifted from my heart. Ms. Jiang believed that the company’s promotion of her as a positive role model for disaster relief was an indication that the company recognized her volunteer work in the disaster area. She received a notice of termination as soon as she returned, but Ms. Jiang never expected that she would be called to a talk by her boss as soon as she arrived at the workplace on the morning of May 28. Her boss blamed her for leaving her post without prior notice and said that she was no longer welcome to return to work. Several days later, she received a notice of termination. Disaster relief cannot be used as an excuse for violating company regulations. One of the company’s officials said that from a moral standpoint, it was commendable for Miss Jiang to go to the disaster area as a volunteer, but as a company employee, she had not obtained approval before leaving, and her leader had not signed to agree, which was a serious violation of labor discipline. According to the company's rules and regulations, three days of absence will be regarded as voluntary resignation. Ms. Jiang has been absent for seven days, which is a serious situation. It is reasonable to terminate the labor contract. The employees believe that disaster relief is a job-related act, and Miss Jiang cannot accept the unit's decision to terminate her employment. She believed that the reports on the unit’s website had already recognized her volunteer team as a branch of the Sohu Volunteer Team, and recognized her as a Sohu volunteer. At the same time, it adopted the pictures and text she sent from the front line of disaster relief, which meant that her work in the disaster area was a job-related act. Therefore, the employer has no factual or legal basis to terminate the labor relationship with her on the grounds of absenteeism. Even if we do not talk about the law, but from the perspective of emotion, what the company did is not convincing. Ms. Jiang believes that, as a volunteer for the company in the disaster area, she actually brought positive effects to the company. The journalist called Nanjing Sohu house network in the afternoon of the day before yesterday. A person in charge of the company said that they would present evidence in the trial to refute Miss Jiang's view. She sued the company for over 2.1 million yuan in compensation in June last year, when Jiang requested the Nanjing Xuanwu District Labor Arbitration Committee to arbitrate and asked the company to continue to fulfill the labor contract. Later, she applied in writing for the termination of the arbitration when the arbitration hearing period had expired, and filed a lawsuit with the Xuanwu District Court of Nanjing in early March this year. This time, she no longer asked the company to continue to fulfill the labor contract, but instead proposed huge compensation, including 834,000 yuan for illegal termination of the labor contract, 417,000 yuan for economic compensation for termination of the labor contract, and more than 200,000 yuan for additional compensation. And demand that the unit pay a total of more than 740,000 yuan in unpaid wages, business commissions, and overtime pay, etc. Chen Shanshan"

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 10, 2008: Bush's Olympic Record: Smiling, applause for the American ""Dream Eight"" Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Fangcan Ignoring the obstruction of a few people, President Bush, who came to Beijing to watch the Olympics from afar, enjoyed this Olympic journey with his family and savored the delicious Olympic meal. On the evening of October 10, he watched the men's basketball match between China and the United States at Wukesong Basketball Hall. During the competition, he cheered for the American athletes with great enthusiasm. After attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games and watching the performance with great enthusiasm, Bush has been seen in the beach volleyball court, the Water Cube and Wukesong Basketball Hall in the past two days. He is taking full advantage of his limited stay to watch as much of the exciting Olympic Games as possible and cheer on the American athletes. Bush is the cheerleading captain of the US Olympic delegation, and has performed very well so far. He expressed the greatest support to the athletes of the American team at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. On the morning of the ninth, he came to Chaoyang Park to visit the US beach volleyball team that was preparing for the competition. He, who is enthusiastic about participating, took part in the game himself, and exchanged skills with the spicy beauties, and hugged them for a group photo. On that day, he also visited the players of the US softball team. Bush brought encouragement and good luck to the US team. With his on-site support, swimming star Phelps won the first gold medal for the US team at the Beijing Olympics and broke the world record. After watching the US women's basketball team play on the 9th, Bush came to Wukesong Basketball Arena again on the 10th. At the beginning of last month, when Bush was attending the G8 summit in Japan, he asked President Hu Jintao of China for tickets to this match. This match ticket is one of the hottest tickets of this Olympic Games, Bush finally got this long-desired ticket. The game started at 10:15 p.m., and Bush arrived at the stadium early. Along with him were his wife Laura, his father, former US President George H. W. Bush, his mother, and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. They were warmly welcomed by the audience and the US team players. Bush is wearing a blue shirt and looks very casual. The game started, and China scored two three-point goals in a row with Sun Yue and Yao Ming, taking the lead in the score over the United States. This also made Bush look gloomy and embarrassed, with his chin in his hand, speechless. The American aide beside him tried to communicate with him, and he shrugged and waved his hands helplessly, looking helpless. The US team then seized the opportunity to take the lead 7-6, and Bush's gloomy face finally cleared up, his face turned sunny, and he clapped his hands with a smile, whispering to his family. But the Chinese team soon took the lead again. Although everyone around was clapping, Bush had a gloomy face and was very nervous. The US team then went on a 7-0 run to tie the score. Bush's excitement was hard to contain. After that, the two sides were in a stalemate, and Bush leaned back in the seat to relax his tense mood. In the second half, the US team was ahead by nine points, but the Chinese team tied the score under Yao Ming's leadership. Bush leaned forward, extending half his body, staring intently at the game on the field, more nervous than anyone else. Seeing the US team score three consecutive times, Bush, who had finally calmed down, turned around to talk to Yang Jiechi for a while, pointing at the field and giving instructions, as if he was very familiar with the game. But China’s counterattack was also effective, and US officials accompanying Bush applauded for Yi Mingming, who remained motionless. With seven minutes left in the second quarter, James drove to the basket, Bush raised his hand high above his head to cheer for the US team. Then the US team launched a beautiful offensive and increased their lead by more than ten points. Bush was a little more at ease, crossed his legs, and relaxed. At the end of the first half, the US team was leading 49-37, and the parched Bush finally remembered to drink. He was drinking water while watching the lion dance, which had a Chinese folk flavor, being performed on the field. He was engrossed in it and asked the Chinese counterparts questions now and then. In the second half, the Chinese team's defense was terrible, and the American team even put on a slam dunk show. Bush was very happy, nodding from time to time and smiling with a sense of achievement. With six minutes and 54 seconds left in the final quarter, the USA was leading China by 34 points, 84-50. Seeing that the victory was certain, Bush and his family left their seats and left early, satisfied. As he walked down from the stands, he waved to the US team members and the Chinese audience on the spot, who responded with applause."

Heard, Dora's Promotion Story 2: Water Years, the movie and TV have a little shadow; Heard, Aino MP4 can play Water Years in the ear... Yes, the first brand of high-definition Aino (ainol) advocates the ""listen"" book leisure new culture, and joins hands with the leading brand of audio books, Souchengke Network, to launch the ""listen to the book together"" movement, the first wave of limited edition audio books Dora version V9000HDA, pre-installed Dora's 2 official high-definition audio, and with the machine, a listening book card worth 500 yuan (containing more than 40,000 yuan of audio books free download and trial listening with paper books) is given, from October 1, 2010 to October 31, 2010, limited release. Now, let's follow Dula拉拉's V9000HDA and enter Dula拉拉's flowing years. The years of youth are like water, you say you are too busy with work, you say you are very tired from studying, you say the pressure is too great, you say the burden is too heavy, you say there are too many entanglements... The world is a huge vortex, dragging and pulling people in. Everyone has their own years of youth. On the way to work and back, on the way to school and back, on the journey and back... anytime and anywhere, bring Dulara version V9000HDA, put on the earphone, sigh Dulara, reflect on yourself: many moods were not released at the time, or because there was no time, or because there was no one to talk to. It passed, and became a faded mood. Shanghai in 2005, summer was not over but autumn was coming. Sales Director of the Major Customer Department, Wang Wei, left DB, and the story continued as before. As a PROBLEMSOLVER who was confident in tackling all kinds of problems, Dula pulled off a strong performance. As women’s flaws and cuteness are increasingly replaced by professional maturity and rules, one can’t help but wonder whether “maturity” is a compliment or a criticism. In the workplace version of the Erya, subordinates have no gender, and the gender of superiors is only related to the degree of authorization. WHY is more important than WHAT. Everyone has their own difficulties. For Shadang Shadang, the problem is not the lover, but the property right of the house; for Dulala, the problem is not the breakup, but the lack of a better relationship. Lala, who was wronged by the broadband compensation system, decided to resign and started her long job hunting journey in the scorching summer of 2006 with a bad mood. As a famous ""stubborn donkey"", she always believed that you and I would have a long-lasting and deep relationship... Still not satisfied after listening to ""Dula 2""? Let's continue then. Dula version V9000HDA, with the 500 yuan Sound Guest Network listening card that comes with the machine, you can download and listen to more than 40,000 yuan worth of audio books for free and for life.

走在高校宣传前沿南京大学本科招生微博更名新浪教育讯16日20时，南京大学本科招生微博由“赵老师的微博”更名为“南京大学”，立即在网络中引起强烈反响，粉丝数量在不到两个小时增加了近200人，引起相关评论突破150条，微博文也被多次转发。“老粉丝”纷纷表示将继续关注母校、南大的发展，为扩大南大知名度出一份力，“新粉丝”找到南京大学后，在表达喜悦的同时也有感于母校、南大采用如此“与时俱进”、“可爱”的方式展示自己。微博，即微博客，是最近新兴起的一个web2.0表现，是一种互动及传播性极快的类似博客的系统。它最大的特点就是集成化和开放化，你可以通过手机、IM软件(gtalk、MSN、QQ、skype)和外部API接口等途径向你的微博客发布消息。由于语言组织编排方便，更新方便，被人迅速而广泛接受。从最近召开的中国首届微博开发者大会获悉，截至目前，新浪微博用户数已经超5000万，并仍以平均每月1000万用户呈现出爆发性的增长，而来自移动终端的微博比例高达38%。我校很快洞察到这一新兴媒体，并成为首家在新浪注册并得到认证的官方招办微博。据学工处负责人介绍，新浪微博2009年8月底开始公测，而我校在2010年2月份就进行了注册，并在5月7日正式上线。上线至今，关注考生和校友已接近9000人，数量位居全国开设微博高校的第三位；博文被转发、评论，以及接受私信接近4000条次，在各高校招办微博中的热度最高。有媒体曾以《高校开微博，北大不敌南大“赵老师”》高度评价我校微博的人性化关怀。在6月7日新浪网推出“高校招办集体开通微博”活动中，南京大学还被首位推介。“赵老师的微博”取自“招生老师的微博”之意，并期打造成为招生办公室在网络中的虚拟代言人。在开通之初，恰逢自主招生开展和随后的招生宣传时期，通过粉丝“转载扩散”的宣传方式和移动终端访问的便捷手段发挥了积极作用。很多粉丝还通过评论和私信的方式给南大招生工作建言献策，有些很快付诸实施，起到了积极效果。粉丝“阳光”曾告诉记者，他曾在其他高校微博发评论或者私信询问，但是没有得到回复，南大是唯一回复他招办微博。“‘赵老师’听上去就感觉是和人对话。”广大粉丝也戏称自己为“赵团”。对于此次更名，学工处负责人解释说，随着招办微博的发展，它所承载的功能正在拓展，而宣传功效的提升也迫切需要更多人的关注，这些群体不仅仅只面向考生，广大关注南京大学发展的校友甚至社会朋友都应成为“赵团”的一员。将招办微博更名为“南京大学”便于大家搜索与识别。对于这一点不少粉丝也曾多次提出过更名的建议。另悉，我校招生微博更名的第二天，新浪教育即推出“中国高校官方微博”大型推介活动，“南京大学”微博榜上有名。18日“南京大学”微博创新性地发起“@行动”(即博文转载行动)，19日又推出“2011年高水平大学合作开展自主选拔签约仪式”文字直播，引起了新浪等媒体的极大关注，并登上新浪教育的首条信息。（转自南京大学新闻网）	赵老师,阳光,赵团	正向	"Leading the way in college promotion, Nanjing University's undergraduate admission Weibo was renamed to ""Nanjing University"" from ""Zhaoli's Weibo"" on the Sina Education News. At 8:00 PM on the 16th, the renaming of Nanjing University's undergraduate admission Weibo immediately caused a strong response on the Internet. The number of fans increased by nearly 200 people in less than two hours, and the number of related comments exceeded 150. The Weibo post was also forwarded multiple times. Old fans expressed their intention to continue to pay attention to the development of their alma mater, Nanjing University, and to contribute to the expansion of Nanjing University's fame. New fans, after finding Nanjing University, expressed their joy and were moved by the fact that their alma mater, Nanjing University, had adopted such an ""up-to-date"" and ""cute"" way to showcase itself. Weibo, a microblog, is a newly emerging web2.0 manifestation, a kind of system similar to a blog with extremely fast interaction and dissemination. Its biggest feature is integration and openness. You can post messages to your microblog via mobile phone, IM software (gtalk, MSN, QQ, Skype) and external API interfaces. Due to the convenient organization and arrangement of language, as well as the convenience of updating, it has been quickly and widely accepted by people. According to the first China Weibo Developers Conference held recently, the number of Sina Weibo users has exceeded 50 million, and it is still growing explosively with an average of 10 million new users per month, and the proportion of Weibo from mobile terminals is as high as 38%. Our school soon realized the potential of this emerging media and became the first official Admissions Office Weibo to register and get certified on Sina Weibo. According to the person in charge of the Student Affairs Office, Sina Weibo began public testing in late August 2009, and our school registered in February 2010 and went online officially on May 7. Up to now, the number of candidates and alumni who have paid attention to us has approached 9,000, ranking third in the number of universities that have set up microblogs in the country; the number of times the blog has been forwarded, commented, and received private messages is close to 4,000, and the popularity is the highest among the admission offices of various universities. Media once highly praised the humanistic care of our school’s microblog with the title “Nanjing University Beats Peking University in Zhao Teacher’s Microblog”. On June 7, Nanjing University was also recommended as the first in the Sina.com ""Collective Opening of Microblogs by University Admissions Offices"" campaign. “Zhaosheng Teacher’s Weibo” is taken from the meaning of “Admissions Teacher’s Weibo” and is expected to become a virtual spokesperson for the Admissions Office on the Internet. At the beginning of its launch, it coincided with the period of independent recruitment and the subsequent recruitment publicity, and the promotional methods of fans ""reposting"" and the convenient means of mobile terminal access played an active role. Many fans also offered advice on the recruitment work of Nan Da through comments and private messages, some of which were implemented quickly and had a positive effect. Fan ""Sunshine"" once told the reporter that he had commented or sent a private message to other universities' Weibo accounts, but had not received a response. NUDT was the only one to reply to his admissions office's Weibo account. ""Mr. Zhao"" sounds like a conversation with a person. The fans also jokingly call themselves ""Zhao Tuan"". The head of the Student Affairs Office explained that with the development of the Admissions Office’s microblog, its functions were expanding, and the need for more people to pay attention to it to enhance its promotional effect was becoming urgent. These groups should not only be limited to candidates, but also include alumni and even friends of Nanjing University who are concerned about its development. Rename the Admissions Office's Weibo account to ""Nanjing University"" for easier search and recognition. Many fans have also suggested renaming it on this point many times. In addition, on the day that our school's enrollment microblog changed its name, Sina Education launched a large-scale promotion activity for ""China's University Microblog"", and ""Nanjing University"" was listed on the microblog list. On the 18th, Nanjing University innovatively launched the ""Action"" (i.e. blog reposting action) on its microblog, and on the 19th, it launched a text live broadcast of the ""2011 High-level University Cooperation for Independent Enrollment Signing Ceremony"". This attracted great attention from media outlets such as Sina, and it topped the first piece of information on Sina Education. (From Nanjing University News Network)"
杜堡签邵佳一后宣布再引前腰高官：他放弃德甲来这里新浪体育讯　北京时间5月20日晚，德乙球队杜伊斯堡官方宣布与本赛季效力于德乙FSV法兰克福的德国球员尤尔根-加苏拉签约两年，这位26岁的球员今夏与球队合同到期，因此杜伊斯堡不用花一分钱转会费即可得到他。拥有德国和阿尔巴尼亚双重国籍的加苏拉司职前腰，新赛季他将成为中国球员邵佳一在球队攻击型前卫位置上的队友和有力竞争对手。加苏拉上赛季在德乙出场32次，共斩获6个进球和7次助攻。在得到他之后俱乐部主帅萨西奇在官网上称：“加苏拉是一名速度很快的中场球员，他拥有很好的视野、很高的传球成功率以及不错的盘带技术。”而俱乐部体育主管布鲁诺-胡布内尔则透露：“加苏拉本来有机会去德甲效力，是俱乐部的理念最终说服了他加盟杜伊斯堡，他会在这里展示他的潜能。”加苏拉也成为了杜伊斯堡在今年夏天签下的第二名攻击型中场球员，此前引进的邵佳一虽然在科特布斯大部分时间出任右前卫，但踢法路数实际上则是一名前腰，攻击更侧重于中路。新赛季两名球员在攻击型中场的位置上既需要合作也面临竞争，但对于已经年过30的邵佳一来说，竞争早已经是家常便饭，尽管杜伊斯堡没有给过佳一任何的主力承诺，但相信已经做好充分准备的他会给球队带来更多的惊喜。(Aaritalo)	邵佳一,佳一,尤尔根-加苏拉,加苏拉,萨西奇,布鲁诺-胡布内尔	正向	"Doubao signed Shao Jia Yi and announced the introduction of a midfielder Gao Guan: he gave up the Bundesliga to come here. Sina Sports News. On the evening of May 20, the second-tier team Duisburg officially announced that it signed German player Jürgen Gassula, who played for FSV Frankfurt in the second tier this season, for two years. This 26-year-old player's contract with the team will expire this summer, so Duisburg can get him for free. Gashula, who plays as a central midfielder, has dual German and Albanian citizenship, and in the new season, he will be a teammate and strong competitor for Chinese player Jia Yi in the attacking midfielder position of the team. Gashua made 32 appearances for the club in the 2019-2020 2.Bundesliga season, scoring 6 goals and providing 7 assists. After obtaining him, the club's coach Sasic said on the official website: ""Gassula is a fast midfielder, he has a good vision, a high passing accuracy and good dribbling skills."" And Bruno Huber, the club's sports director, revealed that ""Gassula had the opportunity to play in the Bundesliga, but it was the club's philosophy that ultimately convinced him to join Duisburg, where he will be able to show his potential."" Gassola also became the second attacking midfielder that Duisburg signed in the summer, with Jia Yi, who was signed before, although played as a right winger most of the time in Hohentübingen, actually played as a central playmaker, with his attacking focus in the middle. Two players will both cooperate and compete for the attacking midfielder position in the new season, but for Jia Yi, who is already over 30, competition is already a matter of course. Although Duisburg did not give Jia Yi any promise of a starting position, it is believed that he will bring more surprises to the team with his full preparation. (Aaritalo)"

The Dalian People's Procuratorate of Liaoning Province charged that on about 11:30 a.m. on May 1, 2011, when defendant Han Fangyi was driving a white Toyota car with the license plate number of Liaoning B89G99, he got into a quarrel and beat Fu Jianwei, a traffic assistant, at the intersection of Malan North Street and Fumin Road in Ganjingzi District, Dalian, because he did not obey Fu Jianwei's traffic command. Then Han Fanyi called his father, defendant Han Jiamin, to inform him that he was beaten, and Han Jiamin then called defendant Zhou Shengqiang to arrive at the scene. Han Jiamin and Zhou Shengqiang arrived at the scene in succession. Han Fangyi immediately pointed out Fu Jianwei to the two defendants. Zhou Shengqiang then went forward to beat Fu Jianwei. At this time, when Dalian Public Security Bureau Traffic Police Brigade Shahekou Detachment Order Squadron officer Shi Yingcai was handling the situation on the scene, he saw the situation and pulled Fu Jianwei behind him and asked Zhou Shengqiang why he was beating someone. Zhou Shengqiang threatened and insulted Shi Yingcai and hit him in the face and head, knocking off Shi Yingcai's police cap on the ground. Han Fangyi went forward to hug Shi Yingcai and pushed him back. Zhou Shengqiang continued to hit Shi Yingcai with his fists, knees, and feet. Han Fangyi threw Shi Yingcai to the ground with a back throw and continued to hug him, causing Shi Yingcai to die from acute coronary heart disease due to external force. The prosecution believes that the defendants Han Fangyi, Han Jiamin, and Zhou Shengqiang intentionally injured others, resulting in one death, and their actions have violated Article 234 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, and they should be held criminally responsible for the crime of intentional injury. Defendants Han Fangyi, Han Jiamin, and Zhou Shengqiang committed a joint crime and should be punished in accordance with Article 25 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China. The plaintiff in the ancillary civil lawsuit initiated the ancillary civil lawsuit and participated in the trial.
欧洲通胀增至1.9%失业率创12年来最高纪录新浪财经讯北京时间10月29日晚间消息，据外电报道，因经济恢复出现放缓迹象，欧洲通胀率不断上升，至近两年来的最高点，失业率创下12年来的最高纪录。设在卢森堡的欧盟统计局近日表示，欧元区消费价格10月同比增长1.9%，9月同比增1.8%。1.9%的增速是2008年11月以来的最大值，超出调查经济学家所得1.8%的预期。另外有报告表示，欧盟失业率9月达10.1%，为1998年7月以来的最高值。原油价格过去两月累计上涨9.2%，欧元走强拖累出口，企业与消费者可用资金减少。经济恢复一波三折，各国政府又纷纷缩减开支应付财政赤字，各大企业便暂停员工招聘，从而进一步影响消费的增加。(楚墨)	楚墨	负向	Inflation in Europe has risen to 1.9%, and the unemployment rate has reached the highest level in 12 years. Sina Finance News, on October 29th, Beijing time, according to foreign media reports, due to the slowdown of economic recovery, the inflation rate in Europe has risen to the highest point in two years, and the unemployment rate has reached the highest level in 12 years. The Eurostat, the EU statistical office in Luxembourg, recently reported that the eurozone's consumer price increased by 1.9% year-on-year in October, up from 1.8% in September. The 1.9% growth rate is the highest since November 2008, exceeding the 1.8% expected by surveyed economists. Another report shows that the unemployment rate in the EU reached 10.1% in September, the highest since July 1998. Crude oil prices have risen by 9.2% over the past two months, and the strong euro has dampened exports, reducing the funds available to businesses and consumers. Economic recovery has been bumpy, and governments around the world have cut spending to address budget deficits, so companies have suspended hiring employees, which further affects the increase in consumption.

MasaMaso：网上“男人装”文|本刊记者丁晓磊“我们是一家服装公司。”北京九合尚品科技有限公司MasaMaso总经理孙弘反复强调。很多在互联网上做服装生意的企业更愿意说自己是一家IT公司，大谈网络工具如何让产品定价低到令人咋舌的地步。孙弘则执著于做一家简单的服装公司。“顾客会通过各种渠道购买低价衣服，但不会放弃对产品质量和设计的要求。MasaMaso不仅仅在价格方面做文章，更要抓住服装的本质。”孙弘说。近两年，网络衬衣直销先锋PPG日进斗金的故事鼓舞众多知名服装公司和互联网人士跃跃欲试，投入网络服装直销的行当中。PPG过的低价捆绑战略成为该行业普遍采用的办法，即产品走中低价位，“68元一件”，“三件起仅需29元”，消费者觉得“产品即使不好，买一次也不会亏到哪里”。这样的销售方式，曾让PPG日出货量达一万件以上。这种繁荣建立在低成本、低质量和高广告投入的基础上，却难以持续。2008年底，有传言称PPG创始人李亮携款潜逃，网络服装直销行业笼罩在夜幕之下。MasaMaso在夜幕中渐渐亮起来。自2008年8月正式上线运营以来，这家企业已经达到盈亏平衡，甚至略有微利，每月处理数千份订单，客单价从开始的157元增长到平均500元，并已积累了两万多注册用户(几乎全部有购买行为)。从创办MasaMaso之初，孙弘就很看重团队成员在传统行业的经验积累。他认为，做企业必须首先抓住行业的本质，至于是做电子商务还是做实体店的销售，这只是一种形式。MasaMaso的员工有一多半来自传统服装业，这一点和PPG、凡客形成鲜明对比。事实上，孙弘自己就是服装行业的老江湖，有着十几年的从业经验。他曾任浙江凯莱股份有限公司、CLEARLUCERNE及北京威可多制衣中心的高管，在设计和采购方面有着丰富的资源。他的创业伙伴张树略曾任深圳网兴科技(中国知名SP，2004年被新浪收购)的高管，现任MasaMaso副总经理，主抓数据挖掘分析和互联网市场营销。MasaMaso的目标是：同等质量，价格最低；同等价格，质量最好。他们把控制服装的质量视为首要问题。孙弘认为，决定一件服装的好与坏有两个因素：一是面料质量，二是加工水平。在面料的选择上，除了少部分在国外采购外，MasaMaso绝大部分使用的是国内质量上乘的雅戈尔和山东鲁泰的面料。在加工方面，孙弘动用资源，不仅找到原来为威可多代工的加工厂，还让香港溢达这样顶尖的加工厂为其生产衬衣。“虽然我们现在的量比较小，但是凭借以前的关系，这些加工厂愿意给我们生产。他们的技术高，残次品率极低，给我们的质量提供了保证。”MasaMaso的员工从产品的工艺设计环节开始，对打样、生产、检验各个环节进行跟踪、监测，在收货时对每件衣服逐一检验。对品质的控制使得MasaMaso的运营成本和产品价格比竞争对手高出不少。以衬衣为例，MasaMaso的售价在200～400元之间，凡客则在200元左右。但和传统服装企业相比，MasaMaso的价格优势则十分明显。以在MasaMaso最畅销的“莫代尔”内裤为例，该产品在迪奥、CK等品牌中是260多的价格，在英国百富是200多的价格，而在MasaMaso只有49.5元。“我们不追求多便宜，只要比你在线下买同质量产品便宜一些就可以了。”孙弘说，“我们不进商场，减少店面投资，通过直销，大大降低流通成本。相比于传统服装企业，MasaMaso赚取的是渠道这部分费用。”服装店设计与质量同等重要。孙弘请来西班牙的设计师为其品牌设计服装，并效仿全球排名第三的服装零售商、西班牙著名服装品牌ZARA的做法，让设计师经常穿梭于各种时装发布会或者出入各种时尚场所，设计一些与顶级品牌的最新产品类似的时装，从而保证MasaMaso紧跟时尚潮流。不过，孙弘真正仰慕的是ZARA供应链管理的理念和水平。“我们的量还很小，对加工厂的控制力还有限，因此暂时还学不来ZARA模式，但是我们可以根据销售数据进行市场预判。”张树略说。目前，MasaMaso对下一月的销售预测准确率平均达到90%以上，产销比能控制在80%～90%。当然，做网络直销必然要利用互联网独有的优势——数据分析。这种分析不仅有助于企业解读消费者的购买行为，还能为消费者提供更好的购买体验。正如亚马逊针对不同用户推荐不同的书籍一样，MasaMaso利用此技术进行服装推荐。“有的人喜欢穿帽衫，有的人喜欢穿衬衣，每个人的倾向不同。我们会根据他们以往的购买习惯进行新品服饰推荐。”张树略说。此外，这种分析还可以根据客户购买数据进行服饰搭配的推荐，这样，不太会穿衣服的男同胞们就可以足不出户自己购买服装了。不过，这项技术并非一蹴而就，而是建立在计算机平台建设和大规模消费数据积累的基础上的。卓越网前副总裁刘俊介绍，亚马逊在美国有一百多台服务器和几位数学家专门做一件事，就是数据挖掘和分析。可见，数据分析对电子商务的作用何其强大。	丁晓磊,孙弘,李亮,张树略,孙弘认,刘俊	正向	"MasaMaso: Men's Wear Online|Reporter Ding Xiaolei of the magazine ""We are a clothing company."" Mr. Sun Hong, the general manager of MasaMaso, a subsidiary of Beijing Jiuhexiangping Technology Co., Ltd., repeatedly emphasized. Many companies that do clothing business online prefer to call themselves IT companies, and talk about how network tools have made product prices so low that they are unbelievable. Sun Hongzhe is obsessed with running a simple clothing company. Customers will buy cheap clothes through various channels, but they will not give up their requirements for product quality and design. MasaMaso does not only play tricks on prices, but also grasp the essence of clothing. Sun Hong said. In the past two years, the story of PPG, a pioneer in direct online shirt sales, making a fortune every day, has inspired many famous clothing companies and internet people to try their luck in the direct online clothing sales business. The low-price bundling strategy of PPG has become a common practice in the industry, with products priced at mid-low levels, ""68 yuan per piece"", ""29 yuan for three pieces or more"", and consumers feeling that ""even if the product is not good, buying once will not lose much."" This kind of sales approach once enabled PPG to ship more than 10,000 pieces per day. This prosperity is based on low cost, low quality, and high advertising investment, but it is difficult to sustain. In late 2008, rumors spread that Li Liang, the founder of PPG, had fled with the money, and the online clothing direct sales industry was shrouded in darkness. MasaMaso gradually brightened in the night. Since its official operation in August 2008, the company has reached a break-even point, even with a slight profit, processing thousands of orders per month, with the average order value increasing from 157 yuan to 500 yuan, and it has accumulated more than 20,000 registered users (almost all of whom have made purchases). Since the inception of MasaMaso, Sun Hong has always placed great emphasis on the experience accumulation of team members in traditional industries. He believes that doing business must first grasp the essence of the industry, and whether it is e-commerce or retail sales, it is just a form. More than half of MasaMaso’s employees come from the traditional clothing industry, which contrasts sharply with PPG and Fanke. In fact, Sun Hong himself is a veteran in the clothing industry, with more than ten years of work experience. He once served as a senior executive of Zhejiang Kailai Co., Ltd., CLEARLUCERNE, and Beijing Weiduo Garment Center, and has rich resources in design and procurement. His business partner, Zhang Shuli, used to be a senior executive of Shenzhen Webex Technology (a well-known SP in China, acquired by Sina in 2004), and is now the deputy general manager of MasaMaso, in charge of data mining and analysis and internet marketing. MasaMaso's goal is: the same quality, the lowest price; the same price, the best quality. They regard the control of the quality of clothing as the top priority. Sun Zhen believes that there are two factors that determine the quality of a piece of clothing: one is the quality of the fabric, and the other is the level of processing. In terms of fabric selection, apart from a small part of the fabrics purchased overseas, MasaMaso mainly uses high-quality fabrics from Yagor and Lutai in Shandong. In terms of production, Sun Hong mobilized resources to find not only the original factories that processed for Weikodo, but also the top shirt factories such as溢达in Hong Kong to produce shirts for him. Although our current volume is small, these processing plants are willing to produce for us based on our previous relationships. Their technology is high, and the rate of defective products is extremely low, which provides quality assurance for us. Employees of MasaMaso track and monitor each process from sample making, production, and inspection, and inspect each piece of clothing individually when receiving the goods. Quality control makes MasaMaso’s operating costs and product prices much higher than those of its competitors. For a shirt, MasaMaso is priced between 200 and 400 yuan, while Fanke is around 200 yuan. But compared to traditional clothing companies, MasaMaso has a clear price advantage. Take the ""Modal"" underwear, which is the best-selling product in MasaMaso, for example. The price of this product is over 260 yuan in brands such as Dior and CK, over 200 yuan in British Farfetch, but only 49.5 yuan in MasaMaso. We don't pursue how cheap it is, we just need it to be a little cheaper than buying the same quality product online. Sun Hong said, ""We will not enter the mall, reduce store investment, and through direct sales, greatly reduce the cost of circulation."" Compared with traditional clothing companies, MasaMaso earns the channel fees. Clothing store design is as important as quality. Sun Hong invited a Spanish designer to design clothing for his brand, and emulated the practices of the third-ranked global clothing retailer, the famous Spanish clothing brand ZARA, by having the designer frequently shuttle between various fashion shows or enter various fashionable places to design some clothing similar to the latest products of top brands, thus ensuring that MasaMaso stays on the cutting edge of fashion. But, Sun Hong truly admired ZARA’s supply chain management philosophy and level. Our volume is still small, and our control over processing plants is limited, so we are not yet able to emulate the ZARA model, but we can make market forecasts based on sales data. ""Zhang Shuli said."" Currently, MasaMaso's sales forecast accuracy for the next month has reached over 90% on average, and the production-sales ratio can be controlled within 80%~90%. Of course, doing direct online sales must make use of the unique advantage of the Internet – data analysis. This analysis not only helps businesses interpret consumer purchasing behavior, but also provides consumers with a better shopping experience. Just as Amazon recommends different books to different users, MasaMaso uses this technology to recommend clothing. Some people like to wear hoodies, while others prefer to wear shirts. Everyone has their own preference. We will recommend new fashion apparel based on their past purchasing habits. ""Zhang Shuli said."" In addition, this analysis can also recommend clothing combinations based on customer purchase data, so that male friends who are not good at dressing can buy clothes at home. However, this technology is not a one-time achievement, but is based on the construction of computer platforms and the accumulation of large-scale consumer data. According to Mr. Jun Liu, the former vice president of Zhenwuwang, Amazon has over a hundred servers and several mathematicians in the United States to do one thing, which is data mining and analysis. It is clear that the role of data analysis in e-commerce is powerful."
美国3月非农就业人数减少66.3万美国3月非农就业人数减少66.3万，市场预期减少64.0万，前值为减少65.1万。据彭博社调查显示，经济学家预期美国3月非农就业人数下滑66万，连续第十五个月下跌。不过早前公布的就业市场数据疲弱，3月非农就业人数下跌数量有望超过70万。同时，美国失业率可能升至8.5%，创1983年以来最高。小贴士：美国非农就业数据非农就业指数反映出制造行业和服务行业的发展及其增长，数字减少便代表企业减低生产，经济步入萧条；如数字大幅增加，显示一个健康的经济状况，理论上对汇率应当有利，并可能预示着更高的利率，则将对美元有利。非农就业指数若增加，反映出经济发展的上升，反之则下降。非农就业指数通常被认为是经济运行最同步且最准确的指标，于每个月第一个星期五公布前一个月的统计结果。就业报告通常被誉为外汇市场能够做出反应的所有经济指标中的“皇冠上的宝石”，它是市场最为敏感的月度经济指标，投资者通常能从中看到众多市场敏感的信息。		负向	"The US non-farm employment decreased by 663,000 in March. The US non-farm employment decreased by 663,000 in March, while the market expected a decrease of 640,000, and the previous value was a decrease of 651,000. According to Bloomberg's survey, economists expect the number of non-farm jobs in the United States in March to decline by 660,000, for the 15th consecutive month. However, the employment market data released earlier was weak, and the number of non-farm employment in March is expected to fall by more than 700,000. Meanwhile, the US unemployment rate could rise to 8.5%, the highest since 1983. Tip: The Non-Farm Payroll Index in the United States reflects the development and growth of the manufacturing and service industries. A decrease in the number indicates that companies are reducing production and the economy is entering a recession. A large increase in the number indicates a healthy economic situation. Theoretically, this should be beneficial for exchange rates and may indicate higher interest rates, which would be beneficial to the US dollar. If the non-farm employment index increases, it reflects an increase in economic development, and vice versa. The non-farm employment index is usually considered the most synchronized and accurate indicator of economic operation, and the statistical results of the previous month are released on the first Friday of each month. Employment reports are often hailed as the ""jewel in the crown"" of all economic indicators that the foreign exchange market can react to, and they are the most sensitive monthly economic indicators in the market, from which investors can usually see a lot of market-sensitive information."
油脂高位震荡追多须谨慎⊙上海中期邓宁宁○编辑杨刚国际农作物减产担忧情绪仍在，在美豆、BMD及原油上行突破走势的带动下，本周国内油脂继续攀升走强。笔者认为，短期油脂高位追涨须谨慎，但因油脂基本面行情好转支撑，试探性高位短空空间有限，设置好止损点位。国际市场上，在整体宏观经济环境维稳基调下，7、8月份是美豆关键生长期，天气不确定性因素支撑美豆自900美分一路飙升。小麦上涨利多溢出影响进而带动美豆冲破1000点关口后继续攀升。从国内采购的美豆1月船期看，以连盘1101油粕价位核算，利润值仍位于100-150元/吨左右。此外，拉尼娜现象拖延棕榈油产量增幅以及7月份马来西亚棕榈油出口温和增加影响，BMD基准10月上冲2600点一线。相对于外盘，国内油脂依然有小幅补涨的空间，但需外围市场及基本面的进一步好转配合。因国内油籽6、7月份进口维持高位，供给库存压力仍在。所以，7月份以来此波油脂期价上涨初期，现货市场始终处于观望状态。至7月下旬，油脂涨势得到外盘以及基本面天气有力支撑，现货行情才缓慢好转，7月下旬以来油脂现货涨幅达300元/吨左右。此外，尽管豆油受国内大豆供给充足压力影响，但在8月份中国、美国大豆生长关键期，天气因素的不确定性仍支撑豆类高位震荡。其次，中国与阿根廷贸易多次交涉未果，限制进口豆油政策继续执行。所以，后续油厂压榨产能或将提高，也预期在传统豆粕备货旺季9、10月份来临前，市场仍处于挺油售粕的心理。豆油价位由此得到有力支撑。周初菜油成交、持仓顺势大幅增加，助推期价1101突破阻力位8500点，创09/10年度新高至8630点，对豆油、棕榈油有较强的带动作用。从现货市场来看，因农民惜售，菜籽价高量少。油脂厂商除了在政策允许范围内增加进口菜籽采购量外，也积极参与期货市场上的菜油买入。近期国际菜籽减产炒作推高进口成本，厂商更青睐于买入交割菜油用于包装等加工。从菜油1009持仓看，国储仓位较重的万达期货，空头持仓1万多手，较稳定。目前，菜油1009价位在8400元/吨左右，相比国储菜油成本8500元/吨，现货菜油8600-8700元/吨，期价仍有望进一步上涨。主力1101多单长线可继续持有，可看多至9000点一线。综上，在维稳的宏观面环境下，油脂基本面缓慢好转配合期价大幅走强。技术上，油脂仍处于上升通道中。但经过近期大幅上涨后，大宗商品均有高位盘整的需求。而且随着双节备货带动需求逐渐完成，后市高位追涨须谨慎。不过，贸易商投机备货需求仍在，基本面仍给予油脂高位震荡支撑。所以，试探性高位短空空间有限，设置好止损点位。技术上，豆油1101在7800-7900点区间有盘整需求，上冲7900点后，多单减磅持有。此外，豆油1101逐渐往远月移仓，豆油1105在8000点处整理后，有望上冲8100点；棕榈油1101多单轻仓继续持有，上方压力位7078点，回调支撑位6800点；菜油1101多单继续持有，中长线关注9000点一线。短线回调支撑位8400点。	邓宁宁,杨刚	正向	Be cautious when buying on the strength of vegetable oils in a high position. Shanghai Zhongqi Deng Ningning. Editor Yang Gang. The concern about the reduction of international agricultural crops is still there. Under the influence of the upward breakthrough trend of US soybeans, BMD, and crude oil, domestic vegetable oils continued to rise and strengthened this week. The author believes that it is cautious to chase the high prices of oils in the short term, but the speculative short selling space at the high level is limited due to the support of the fundamental situation of oils, and the stop-loss points should be set properly. On the international market, with the overall macroeconomic environment maintained stable, July and August are the key growing periods for soybeans, and the uncertainty of weather factors has supported soybeans to soar from 900 cents. The rise in wheat has a positive spillover effect, which then drives soybeans to break through the 1000-point mark and continue to rise. For the January shipment of US soybeans purchased from domestic sources, the profit value is still around 100-150 yuan per ton based on the price of the 1101 contract of the futures market. In addition, the La Nina phenomenon delayed the increase in palm oil production and the moderate increase in Malaysian palm oil exports in July, pushing the BMD benchmark up to around 2600 points in October. Compared with the foreign market, domestic vegetable oils still have a small space for catch-up, but need further improvement in the external market and fundamentals. Due to the high import of oilseed in June and July, the supply and inventory pressure is still there. So, during the early stage of this wave of vegetable oil futures price increase since July, the spot market was always in a state of waiting and watching. By late July, the vegetable oil market had improved slowly with strong support from the overseas market and fundamentals, with the spot prices of vegetable oils rising by about 300 yuan per ton since late July. In addition, although soybean oil is under pressure from ample domestic soybean supply, the uncertainty of weather factors during the key growth period of soybeans in China and the United States in August still supported the soybean varieties at a high level. Second, China's multiple trade negotiations with Argentina have failed, and the policy of restricting the import of soybean oil continues to be enforced. So, the subsequent oil mill pressing capacity may be increased, and it is also expected that the market will still be in a state of selling oil and buying meal before the traditional soybean meal inventory peak in September and October. The soybean oil price is thus well supported. At the beginning of the week, the transaction and position of rapeseed oil increased significantly, which pushed the price of 1101 to break through the resistance level of 8500 points and reached a new high of 8630 points in 2009/10, which had a strong driving effect on soybean oil and palm oil. From the spot market, rapeseed prices are high and supplies are tight due to farmers'惜售. In addition to increasing the purchase of rapeseed within the scope allowed by policy, oilseed processors also actively participate in the purchase of rapeseed oil in the futures market. Recent international rape seed reduction hype has pushed up import costs, and manufacturers prefer to buy delivery rapeseed oil for packaging and other processing. From the position of rapeseed 1009, the state reserve position of Wanda Futures, which is relatively heavy, has more than 10,000 hands of short positions, which is relatively stable. Currently, the price of rapeseed oil 1009 is around 8,400 yuan per ton. Compared with the cost of national reserve rapeseed oil at 8,500 yuan per ton and the spot rapeseed oil at 8,600-8,700 yuan per ton, the futures price is still expected to rise further. The main 1101 long position can continue to hold for the long term and can be seen up to 9000 points. In summary, under the macro environment of maintaining stability, the fundamentals of vegetable oils have slowly improved, while the futures prices have significantly strengthened. Technically, oils are still in an upward channel. But after a recent sharp rise, there is a need for a consolidation at high levels for most commodities. And with the demand gradually completed by the Double Festival inventory buildup, caution is needed for buying at higher prices in the future. However, the speculative buying demand from traders still exists, and the fundamentals still provide support for the high and volatile oscillation of oils. So, the speculative high opening short position has limited space, set the stop-loss point. Technically, there is a need for consolidation of rapeseed oil 1101 in the range of 7800-7900 points, and long positions should be reduced and held after a push to 7900 points. In addition, the soybean oil 1101 is gradually moving to the distant month, and soybean oil 1105, after consolidation at 8000 points, is expected to break through 8100 points. Palm oil 1101 long positions can continue to hold with light positions, with resistance at 7078 points and support at 6800 points. Rapeseed oil 1101 long positions can continue to hold, and the medium and long-term focus is on the 9000 point level. Short-term rebound support at 8400 points.
日本首相和民主党干事长收到装子弹威胁信日本首相鸠山由纪夫和执政党民主党干事长小泽一郎28日同时收到装有子弹的威胁信。日本内阁官房副长官松野赖久表示，首相办公室当天收到了一封疑似装有子弹的信，随即将这封没有打开的信交给了警方。警方在使用X光进行扫描后证实说，信里确实装有一枚子弹。此外，警方还发现信封里有一张写着“死”的纸条。东京警方表示，执政党民主党干事长小泽一郎的办公室当天也收到了一封装有子弹的威胁信。小泽一郎的秘书于当天下午5点半左右在新乡里发现了这封含有子弹的威胁信，并报告了警察。除了子弹外，这封信内还附有一张卡片，警方称，寄信者在卡片上要求小泽一郎辞职。目前还不清楚这些威胁信是由何人寄出。有关官员猜测，子弹威胁信针对的主要目标可能是小泽。在鸠山政府去年9月上台后，小泽一郎的办公室和住所、民主党总部以及日本朝日电视台都曾收到过抨击小泽的子弹信。目前鸠山和小泽均身陷政治献金丑闻。而鸠山为小泽辩护，引起了日本在野党和公众的不满。（马晶）	鸠山由纪夫,鸠山,小泽一郎,小泽,松野赖久,马晶	负向	Prime Minister of Japan and the Secretary General of the Democratic Party received a threatening letter with bullets. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and the Secretary General of the ruling Democratic Party, Katsuya Okada, received a threatening letter containing bullets on the 28th. Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said that the Prime Minister's office received a letter that was suspected to contain bullets on that day, and immediately handed the unopened letter to the police. The police confirmed that the letter did contain a bullet after scanning it with X-rays. In addition, the police found a note in an envelope that read “dead”. The Tokyo police said that the office of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan's secretary-general, Seiichi Nakasone, also received a threatening letter containing bullets on the same day. At around 5:30 pm on that day, Kōzō Kōno, a secretary of Seiichi Nakasone, found a threatening letter containing a bullet in Nishinomiya and reported it to the police. In addition to the bullets, a card was also attached to the letter, which the police said asked Kōzō Kōzuki to resign. It is not yet clear who sent these threatening letters. Officials speculated that the bullet threat letter was mainly aimed at Kozawa. After the鸠山 government took office in September last year, letters containing bullets criticizing Katsuya Okada were received at Okada’s office and residence, the headquarters of the Democratic Party, and the Asahi TV in Japan. Both Kōjima and Kōzé are currently embroiled in a political fund-raising scandal. And Kōjima’s defense of Sasaki has caused dissatisfaction among Japan’s opposition parties and the public. (Ma Jing)
传金德因降级选择退出副总否认国脚微博流露退意新浪体育讯　中超大幕落下，重庆和长沙黯然降级，这也给他们的前景蒙上了一层阴影。在金德降级后，曾有记者现场询问是否还会继续搞足球，当时俱乐部高层并没有给出准确的答复。今天，有消息透露金德集团将退出足球圈，长沙金德也将解散。不过，金德副总宗杰在接受记者采访时表示还并没有确定是否退出，金德球员也表示不知情。在将主场迁到长沙以后，金德的表现始终不尽如人意，在长沙也并没有太好的球迷市场，球队糟糕的战绩更是提不起当地球迷的兴趣。今年湖南湘涛成功冲甲，这弥补了湖南足球在职业联赛的空缺，而且湘涛也得到了湖南体育局领导的支持，金德的位置更为尴尬。就在这种情况下，金德又惨遭降级，必然会失去更多的市场。在这种情况下，金德将要解散的消息传出也并非意外。据记者了解，目前金德俱乐部还没有确定是否要退出，即便是退出，以什么样的形式退出也还没有确定。副总宗杰在接受记者采访时表示：“现在一切都没有定，说确定解散的消息都是假的。”之后，记者又电话联系了金德的几名球员，他们都表示现在都并不知情。不过，金德球员也都透露，俱乐部并没有明确下次集中的时间。值得注意的是，金德队长，现役国脚汪强今天更新了新浪微博(http://t.sina.com.cn)，也多少透露出了离别的伤感。在微博中，汪强首先说到：“顺其自然吧。”之后，他又发微博说：“明年的我会在哪里踢球呢。”流露出了一种离别的情绪。最新的一条微博中，汪强直言：“看到队友一个个走了，我的心理有种说不出来的难受，或许这一别不知道什么时候能在见面。希望我的队友们能够有个美好的未来，尤其刚上队的小孩们。越来越想家了。”(asenna)	金德,宗杰,汪强	正向	"Golden Field, due to the relegation, chose to withdraw from the vice president, and the national team's microblog revealed the intention to withdraw. Sina Sports News. The curtain of the Chinese Super League has fallen, and Chongqing and Changsha have been relegated, which also casts a shadow on their prospects. After Jin De was relegated, a journalist asked on the spot whether they would continue to play football. At that time, the club's management did not give a clear answer. Today, it was reported that Kingde Group will withdraw from the football circle, and Changsha Kingde will also disband. However, Vice President Zong Jie of Jin De told the reporter that they had not yet determined whether to withdraw, and Jin De players also said they were unaware. After moving its home ground to Changsha, Jin De's performance has always been unsatisfactory, and there is no good fan market in Changsha. The team's poor performance has also failed to arouse the interest of local fans. This year, Xiangtuo in Hunan Province successfully promoted to the first division, which filled the gap of professional football in Hunan Province, and Xiangtuo also received the support of the leadership of Hunan Sports Bureau, making Jin De's position more awkward. Under these circumstances, Golden again suffered relegation and would inevitably lose more market share. It was not surprising that news of King's impending dissolution also emerged. According to the reporters, the Golden Field club has not yet decided whether to withdraw, and even if it withdraws, the form of withdrawal has not yet been determined. Zong Jie, the deputy general manager, told the reporters that everything is still not decided, and the news of the definite dissolution is a lie. Afterwards, the reporters contacted several players of Jin De by phone, and they all said that they were not aware of it now. However, the Golden Lion players also revealed that the club has not clearly specified the time of the next concentration. Notably, the captain of Jin De, active national football player Wang Qiang, updated his Sina Weibo today (http://t.sina.com.cn), and also revealed a little of the sadness of farewell. Wang Qiang said on Weibo, ""Go with the flow."" Then he tweeted, ""Where will I play next year?"" It revealed a mood of parting. In the latest microblog post, Wang Qiang said directly: ""Seeing my teammates leave one by one, I have an indescribable feeling of sadness in my heart, perhaps this separation may not meet again for a long time."" I hope that my teammates will have a good future, especially the children who have just joined the team. I miss home more and more. (adjust)"
证监会批准上期所开展线材和螺纹钢期货交易为贯彻落实《国务院办公厅关于当前金融促进经济发展的若干意见》关于“尽快推出适应国民经济发展需要的钢材等商品期货新品种”的重要战略部署，近日中国证监会批准上海期货交易所（以下简称上期所）开展线材和螺纹钢期货交易。按照《期货交易管理条例》和《期货交易所管理办法》的相关规定，在各项准备工作就绪和相关程序履行完毕后，中国证监会将尽快批准上期所挂牌其期货合约。钢铁是重要的工业原材料，被称为工业的“骨骼”。钢铁工业是国民经济重要的支柱产业，是国民经济社会发展水平和综合实力的重要标志。1996年，我国钢产量首次突破1亿吨，成为世界钢产量最大的国家，并在此后一直位居世界首位。2007年，我国钢产量4.89亿吨，占全球总产量的36.4%，超过了钢产量排名第二至第八位国家的总和。而且，我国从2006年开始成为世界上最大的钢材出口国，2007年共出口6264万吨，在国际市场占有重要地位。1993年，我国钢材价格全面放开，价格完全由市场决定。一直以来，钢材价格波动较大，市场风险较为明显。钢材生产、贸易和消费企业缺乏权威的价格信号来指导生产和经营，也无法规避价格波动的风险。本次国际金融危机中，相关行业企业运用铜、铝等有色金属期货交易在应对价格剧烈波动风险方面发挥了积极作用，钢材现货企业利用钢材期货市场来发现价格并进行套期保值的需求也日益强烈。开展钢材期货交易，一是有助于形成钢材现货与期货有机结合的市场体系，规范和完善钢材流通市场；二是逐步优化钢材价格形成机制，指导钢铁上下游企业合理安排生产和经营，帮助政府部门及时、准确地把握市场变化趋势，及早采取调控措施，保障资源的合理配置和市场的供求平衡；三是为钢铁生产、贸易和消费企业提供低成本、高效率的风险控制手段，提高企业管理水平，增强市场竞争力，推动钢铁行业的稳步发展；四是通过品牌注册的方式，吸引和鼓励规模领先、技术先进、环保达标的钢铁企业将产品注册为交割品种，促进钢铁工业健康有序发展，切实贯彻落实《钢铁产业发展政策》；五是依靠钢铁出口大国的优势，增强我国在钢材贸易中的定价影响力，提高我国钢铁工业的国际竞争力。总之，通过钢材期货交易市场的建立，使其经济功能逐步发挥，为国民经济增长提供服务。钢材分类多样，规模复杂，品种繁多。经过认真研究和深入调研，根据现货市场的实际情况和期货合约设计的技术要求，线材和螺纹钢作为钢材期货合约的交易标的较为合理。目前，上期所已经完成了线材和螺纹钢期货合约的前期设计工作，确定了通用性强、流通量大的合约标的，拟定了较为严格的交易、结算和交割制度，论证了梯度保证金制度、涨跌停板制度、持仓限额制度等风险控制措施。中国证监会将在市场风险可控、可测、可承受的前提下，按照相关法律法规的规定批准上期所尽早挂牌钢材期货合约，并指导和督促上期所根据市场发展情况，认真做好钢材期货的培育工作，逐步完善钢材期货品种体系。相关报道：合约草案曝光钢材期货行进中钢材期货打响产品创新第一炮钢材期货叩门钢铁股涨停迎新钢材期货推动钢铁企业市场化进程钢材期货的推出对钢铁行业影响深远国内外钢材期货资料介绍钢材期货历史回顾		正向	"CSRC Approved SPGE to Launch Wire Rod and Rebar Futures Trading to implement the important strategic deployment of the Several Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on the Current Financial Work to Promote the Economic Development, the CSRC recently approved SPGE to launch wire rod and rebar futures trading. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Regulations on Futures Trading Administration and the Measures for the Administration of Futures Exchanges, the CSRC will approve the listing of the futures contracts of the SSE as soon as all the preparatory work is completed and the relevant procedures are fulfilled. Steel is an important industrial raw material, known as the ""skeleton"" of industry. The steel industry is an important pillar industry of the national economy, and an important symbol of the level of national economic and social development and comprehensive national strength. In 1996, China's steel production exceeded 100 million tons for the first time, becoming the world's largest steel producer, and has since remained at the top of the world. In 2007, China's steel production was 489 million tons, accounting for 36.4% of the global total, surpassing the total of the second to eighth largest steel producing countries. And, since 2006, China has become the world’s largest steel exporter, exporting 62.64 million tons in 2007, and holding an important position in the international market. In 1993, China's steel prices were fully liberalized, and prices were determined entirely by the market. Steel prices have fluctuated greatly and market risks have been more obvious all along. Steel production, trading and consumption enterprises lack authoritative price signals to guide production and operations, and they are also unable to hedge against the risks of price fluctuations. During the recent international financial crisis, related industry enterprises have played a positive role in responding to the risk of price fluctuations by using futures transactions of non-ferrous metals such as copper and aluminum. The demand of steel spot enterprises to use the futures market of steel to discover prices and hedge has become increasingly strong. To conduct futures trading in steel, first, it is conducive to forming a market system that organically combines steel spot and futures, standardizing and improving the steel circulation market; second, it gradually optimizes the mechanism for forming steel prices, guiding steel upstream and downstream enterprises to reasonably arrange production and operation, helping government departments to timely and accurately grasp the trend of market changes, take early regulatory measures, and ensure the rational allocation of resources and the supply and demand balance of the market; third, it provides steel production, trade, and consumption enterprises with low-cost and high-efficiency risk control means, improving the management level of enterprises, enhancing market competitiveness, and promoting the steady development of the steel industry; fourth, by registering brands, attracting and encouraging leading steel enterprises with advanced technology and environmental protection standards to register their products as delivery varieties, promoting the healthy and orderly development of the steel industry, and earnestly implementing the ""Steel Industry Development Policy""; fifth, relying on the advantage of being a major steel exporting country, enhancing China's pricing influence in steel trade, and improving the international competitiveness of China's steel industry. In short, through the establishment of the steel futures trading market, its economic functions will gradually be brought into play to provide services for the growth of national economy. Steel is classified in a variety of ways, with complex specifications and a wide range of varieties. After careful study and in-depth research, and based on the actual situation of the spot market and the technical requirements for the design of futures contracts, it is reasonable to use wire rods and rebar as the trading objects for steel futures contracts. Currently, the SSE has completed the preliminary design of the futures contract for rebar and wire rod, determined the general and widely circulated contract subject, formulated relatively strict trading, settlement and delivery systems, and argued for risk control measures such as tiered margin system, daily price limit system, and position limit system. Under the premise that the market risks are controllable, measurable and bearable, the CSRC will approve the listing of steel futures contracts on the SSE as soon as possible in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, and guide and urge the SSE to do a good job in cultivating steel futures according to the market development situation, and gradually improve the variety system of steel futures. Relevant reports: The draft contract is exposed, the steel futures are advancing, the steel futures have fired the first shot of product innovation, the steel futures have knocked on the steel stock market, the steel stocks have closed up to welcome the new steel futures, the launch of steel futures has promoted the market-oriented process of steel enterprises, and the launch of steel futures has a profound impact on the steel industry. Domestic and foreign steel futures materials are introduced, and the history of steel futures is reviewed."

科比自作孽毁四大里程碑一素质他差乔丹太远太远新浪体育讯　北京时间4月23日，洛杉矶湖人客场96-101不敌俄克拉荷马雷霆，两队总比分被扳成2-1。科比-布莱恩特得到24分8次助攻，但凯文-杜兰特更胜一筹砍下29分19个篮板，外加拉塞尔-威斯布鲁克送上的27分，雷霆迎来球队搬入俄克拉荷马城后的第一场季后赛胜利。而科比，只能独自品尝失利的苦滋味了。从湖人队史角度来说，这本是一个需要铭记的夜晚，因为科比晋升为NBA历史第五大季后赛得分手，同时紫金军队史季后赛得分王也正式易主，从杰里-韦斯特传递给了科比。但如此的里程碑时刻，却以一场窝囊的输球告终，这恐怕让飞侠不愿意去回忆。湖人领先了3节却被年轻没经验的雷霆末节翻盘，科比不仅没有扮演救世主，反而成为输球重要原因。第四节后半段湖人落后命悬一线，科比想要站出来拯救球队，却因为自己过于蛮干而让胜利溜走，毫不客气的说是科比自己搅黄了自己的队史季后赛得分王登基典礼。很有讽刺意义的一点在于，科比最近四大里程碑时刻，都以球队输球告终。成为史上最年轻的25000分先生，湖人输给骑士常规赛被对手横扫；成为湖人队史常规赛得分王，湖人93-95输给实力平平的灰熊；总得分超越雷吉-米勒，湖人输给小牛；今天成为队史季后赛得分王，湖人输给雷霆。或许是天妒英才，科比就像中了什么特殊的“魔咒”，在里程碑时刻总是不能赢球。再一再二再三出现这种情况，就能从中找到些原因了。25000分输给骑士，科比出手31次，其中下半场15中3；超越韦斯特一役，科比出手28次；超越米勒一战，科比投篮是这几场最少但也达到23次，而且第四节几乎是毫无作为；今天，科比出手29次，其中扔了11个三分。四大里程碑比赛，科比平均投篮接近28次。从这些数字上不难看出，科比在这几个里程碑意义的比赛中都偏向于单打独斗，出手次数都明显超出赛季平均值，这，也成为球队输球一个不可回避的因素。谁都知道，科比的斗志好胜心是联盟中少有，他永远力求完美的做派确实是一柄双刃剑，用不好就伤了球队。就像有些人评价的，有时候看科比的比赛，他经常是有“困难要上，没有困难制造困难也要上”，救世主情节在他心中占据了太大的份额，像今天第四节这种关键时刻往往就丢掉了冷静。不得不再次提到那个说“滥”的话题：科比和乔丹。两人有太多太多相似之处，而在联盟历史上也很难找到比飞侠更接近乔丹的人了。但最接近，并不代表科比真的已经超越或者比肩昔日飞人，湖人当家的篮球境界确实高，但其赛场心智却还难以跟乔丹相提并论，同样的胜利渴望程度，可乔丹在大部分时候的处理球能力都相比科比冷静合理的多，像这种季后赛中因为迷恋自我而葬送球队的情况在颠覆乔丹身上几乎找不到。如果科比真能把这一点也提高到当年乔丹的水准，才能真正具备跟乔丹对比的资格。(vincent)	科比,乔丹,科比-布莱恩特,凯文-杜兰特,拉塞尔-威斯布鲁克,杰里-韦斯特,韦斯特,飞侠,雷吉-米勒,米勒,vincent	负向	"Kobe's self-inflicted destruction of the four major milestones is too far away from Jordan. Sina Sports News, on April 23, the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Oklahoma Thunder 96-101 away, and the two teams' total score was tied 2-1. Kobe Bryant scored 24 points and made 8 assists, but Kevin Durant scored 29 points and grabbed 19 rebounds, and Russell Westbrook added 27 points, leading the Thunder to their first playoff victory since moving to Oklahoma City. And for Kobe, the bitter taste of defeat was to be savored alone. From the perspective of the Lakers' history, this was a night that needed to be remembered, as Kobe rose to become the fifth-highest scorer in NBA playoff history, and the Lakers' all-time playoff scoring leader was officially passed from Jerry West to Kobe. But such a milestone moment ended with a humiliating defeat, which the Fly Guy may not want to recall. The Lakers led for three quarters, but were overturned by the inexperienced Thunder in the final quarter. Not only did Kobe fail to play the role of savior, but he also became an important reason for the loss. In the latter part of the fourth quarter, the Lakers were on the brink of defeat, and Kobe wanted to come out and save the team, but he lost the victory because of his reckless play. It is not an exaggeration to say that it was Kobe himself who ruined the coronation ceremony of the Lakers' all-time playoff points leader. It is ironic that all of Kobe’s four recent milestone moments ended with the team losing. To become the youngest player in history to score 25,000 points, the Lakers lost to the Cavaliers and were swept in the regular season; to become the Lakers' all-time regular season scoring champion, the Lakers lost 93-95 to an average Grizzlies team; to surpass Reggie Miller's total points, the Lakers lost to the Mavericks; today, to become the Lakers' all-time playoff scoring champion, the Lakers lost to the Thunder. Perhaps it was heaven's jealousy of talent, and Kobe was like a special ""curse"", always unable to win in milestone moments. If this happens again and again, we can find a reason for it. They lost 25,000 points to the Cavaliers, and Kobe made 31 shots, of which 15 were made in the second half; in the game where he surpassed West, Kobe made 28 shots; in the game where he surpassed Miller, Kobe's shooting was the least of these games, but he still reached 23 times, and in the fourth quarter, he did almost nothing; today, Kobe made 29 shots, of which he threw 11 three-pointers. Four milestone games, Kobe averaged nearly 28 shots per game. It is not difficult to see from these figures that Kobe was inclined to go it alone in these milestone games, with his shot attempts significantly exceeding the average for the season, which also became an unavoidable factor in the team’s losses. Everyone knows that Kobe's competitiveness is rare in the league, and his forever pursuit of perfection is indeed a double-edged sword, which can hurt the team if not used properly. As some people have commented, sometimes when watching Kobe's games, he often has ""difficulties to be overcome, and difficulties to be created if there are none, to be overcome"", and the savior plot occupies too much of his heart. Like today's fourth quarter, it often lost its cool in such critical moments. It is necessary to mention again the topic of ""excess"": Kobe and Jordan. There are too many similarities between the two, and it is also difficult to find someone in the league who is closer to Jordan than Flyin. But the closest does not mean that Kobe has really surpassed or equaled the former flying man. The basketball realm of the Lakers' core is indeed high, but its court mentality is still difficult to compare with Jordan. The same level of desire for victory, but Jordan's ball handling ability is much more calm and reasonable than Kobe in most cases. There is almost no case of sacrificing the team for the sake of self-love in the playoffs. If Kobe could also improve this to Jordan's level, he would truly have the qualifications to compare with Jordan. (vincent)"
墨西哥西北部集体墓地挖出104具尸体中新网4月28日电据外电报道，墨西哥警方27日在西北部杜兰戈州首府再次在集体墓地中挖出8具不明身份的尸体，使得该市一个月来挖出的尸体总数达到104具。杜兰戈州司法部长办公室发布声明称，警方在杜兰戈市一家汽车修理车间墓坑的挖掘工作已经结束。包括27日挖出的8具尸体在内，在这个墓地中共挖出87具尸体。4月中旬，在距离这个汽车修理车间不到1英里的一个农场，警方找到17具已经腐烂的尸体。杜兰戈发现集体墓地，是一个月以来墨西哥发生的第二起类似事件。警方在东北部毗邻美国的塔毛利帕斯州发现了40个集体墓地，迄今已挖出183具尸体。报道称，自从4年前墨西哥总统卡尔德隆派出数千名安保士兵打击毒品走私犯罪以来，与贩毒有关的暴力活动已经造成3.46万人死亡。在打击毒品犯罪的行动中，发现集体墓地成为越来越常见的现象。	卡尔德隆	正向	104 bodies were found in a collective cemetery in northwestern Mexico. On April 28, 2021, according to foreign media reports, the Mexican police dug out 8 unidentified bodies in the collective cemetery in the capital of Durango state in the northwest again on the 27th, making the total number of bodies dug out in the city in the past month reach 104. The office of the Attorney General of Durango State issued a statement saying that the police had finished digging a grave in a car repair shop's cemetery in Durango City. Including the 8 bodies dug out on the 27th, a total of 87 bodies were dug out in this cemetery. In mid-April, police found 17 decomposed bodies on a farm less than a mile from this auto repair shop. Durango discovered a mass grave, which is the second such incident in Mexico in the past month. Police in northeastern Tamaulipas, which borders the US, have uncovered 40 mass graves, and 183 bodies have been exhumed so far. It is reported that since Mexican President Calderon sent thousands of security troops to combat drug trafficking crimes four years ago, violence related to drug trafficking has claimed 34,600 lives. In the fight against drug crime, the discovery of collective cemeteries has become increasingly common.
恒指触及箱体底部反弹时富金融周四，恒指收报22609.83点，下跌51.8点，跌幅为0.23%；国企指数收报12472.59点，下跌108.96点，跌幅为0.87%；大市成交807.5亿港元。由于美国经济有放缓迹象，且美联储未表示推出QE3倾向，美股继续小幅下跌。港股早盘小幅低开后，恒指顺势跌破年线，之后一度扩大跌势。但尾盘在地产股带动下快速拉升，跌势显著收窄。银行股继续弱势。除民生银行(01988.HK)逆市上涨1.53%外，其它内银股全线下跌，交通银行、农业银行、重庆农村商业银行均跌逾2%。港银股表现稍好，渣打集团、恒生银行小幅收涨。国际原油期货价格上升，且发改委表示年内有望推出新的成品油定价机制，可能将定价权下放给三大石油公司，刺激石化板块上扬。中石化冠德上涨2.91%，海峡石油化工、中石化涨逾1%，中海油、中石油小幅收涨。而航空股则受压明显，中国南方航空重挫4.75%，中国东方航空、中国国航均跌逾2%。全球范围经济放缓预期，以及收紧流动性的担忧，左右了近日疲弱的大市。恒指今向下考验了中期箱体波动区间的下限22400附近，之后获得支撑反弹。尽管已是六连跌，但周四尾盘的强势拉升，显示多头反击力量有所加强。下周内地又将迎来一系列宏观经济数据，将对大市起到重要影响，多空可能趋向谨慎。港股有望暂时出现一个顺息时机。欢迎发表评论我要评论		正向	When the Hang Seng Index bounces back from the bottom of the box, financial stocks rose on Thursday, the Hang Seng Index closed at 22,609.83 points, down 51.8 points, or 0.23%; the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index closed at 12,472.59 points, down 108.96 points, or 0.87%; the market turnover was 80.75 billion Hong Kong dollars. Due to the signs of slowing US economy and the Fed's lack of intention to launch QE3, the US stock market continued to fall slightly. The Hang Seng Index opened slightly lower in the morning, broke through the annual line, and then expanded the decline. But the closing was significantly narrowed as real estate stocks pulled up quickly. Bank stocks continue to be weak. Except for China Minsheng Bank (01988.HK), which rose 1.53% against the trend, all other domestic banks fell, with ICBC, ABC, and Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank all falling more than 2%. Hong Kong banking stocks performed slightly better, with Standard Chartered and HSBC rising slightly. International crude oil futures prices have risen, and the NDRC has stated that a new mechanism for setting the prices of refined oil products may be introduced this year, which may delegate pricing authority to the three major oil companies, stimulating the petrochemical sector. China National Shale Gas and China National Chemical rose by 2.91%, while China National Offshore Oil and China National Petroleum Corporation saw a slight increase. Airline stocks were under significant pressure, with China Southern Airlines falling 4.75%, and China Eastern Airlines and Air China both down more than 2%. Global economic slowdown and concerns over tightening liquidity have been the main factors behind the weak market in recent days. The Hang Seng Index has tested the lower limit of the intermediate box fluctuation range around 22,400 and has since gained support and rebounded. Despite six consecutive declines, the strong rebound at the end of Thursday's trading session showed that the bulls' counterattack strength had strengthened. Next week, a series of macroeconomic data will be released on the mainland, which will have a significant impact on the market, and both bulls and bears may become more cautious. Hong Kong stocks are expected to have a temporary opportunity for a smooth period. Welcome to comment I want to comment
交警让违章司机写检查及格者可放行(图)卷面干净和语言通顺10分定性自己的违法行为30分思路清晰的改正措施30分认识违法行为的后果30分“我认识到了自己的错误，今后一定改正。”别以为你看到的是某个学生的检讨，这可是违法司机的“检查”。交警采取这样的教育方式，还有专门的打分标准，及格了，就能免予被拘留的处罚。交警表示，此举更多的是教育意义。-商报记者邢军通讯员李东亚半小时内查到7辆违法车昨日上午10时许，郑州市交警三大队民警，在郑密路黄岗寺附近进行交通整治活动。这里连接着郑石高速的入口，大货车、长途客车经常聚集，客车上下人也引来了很多拉客的机动三轮车，导致原本就繁忙的郑密路通行更不畅。民警在路口一边疏导交通，一边查处违法车辆。半个小时后，民警就查扣了7名司机的车辆，他们中4人是无证驾驶，1人驾车没带驾驶证，1人驾车逆行，1人驾车拉货但没关后车门。随后，这7名司机都被带到交警三大队春晖路事故停车场接受处理。事故车前先上堂警示课据交警郑敏军讲，按照交通法的规定，无证驾驶要被处以15日以下拘留，1500元以下罚款。如果按照这种标准，有5人面临很严厉的处罚。但事实上，交警并没有对他们采用这种简单的罚款、拘留的方式，而是重点进行批评教育。在事故停车场内，民警郑敏军将7人带到了一辆已成废铁的事故轿车旁，告诉他们：11月21日，在郑密路上，一辆东风大货车在违法超车时，从右前侧撞上这辆比亚迪F3轿车，轿车被撕裂为两半，轿车司机当场死亡。而货车司机也为自己的行为付出了惨痛的代价。“很多事故都是由我们违法驾驶导致的，眼前就是一个很惨痛的教训。”郑敏军说。“及格”可免予拘留处罚之后，民警给每个人发了一张纸，让他们看事故写“故事”，分4个部分。而且，交警还给他们宣读了打分标准，及格线为60分，及格了可免予拘留处罚。评分标准是这样定的：第一部分是卷面干净，语言通顺，10分；第二部分是给自己的违法行为定性，要全面准确，30分；第三部分是对此行为的改正措施，要思路清晰，30分；第四部分是违法行为的后果，要认识到位，30分。“我叫华廷杰，4日上午被交警查了，我没有驾驶证，违反了法律，以后一定吸取这个教训，安全驾驶。”这是华廷杰所写的“故事”的一段，小学毕业的他写得很专心。“该咋说咋说，俺确实不对，以后一定改。”司机苏建国说。“其实打分只是一种形式，主要是看他们态度如何。作为交警的一种管理手段，可以对认错态度好的司机减轻或免予处罚。”交警郑敏军说，同时，这就相当于一份保证书，如果下次再被交警查到，就要按法律来处理了。	邢军,李东亚,郑密,郑敏军,华廷杰,苏建国	正向	"Traffic police made drivers who violated traffic rules write self-examinations, and those who passed could be released (picture). Clean handwriting and smooth language 10 points for self-assessment of illegal behavior 30 points for clear corrective measures 30 points for understanding the consequences of illegal behavior ""I have realized my mistake and will definitely correct it in the future."" Don't think that what you see is a student's self-criticism. This is the ""check"" of a driver who is breaking the law. Traffic police adopt such an educational approach, with a dedicated scoring system. If one passes, they can be exempted from the penalty of detention. The traffic police said that the move was more for educational purposes. -Xing Jun, a reporter from the Commercial Journal, and Li Dongya, a reporter from the local public security bureau, found seven illegal vehicles in half an hour. At around 10:00 am yesterday, the traffic police of the Third Detachment of Zhengzhou City were carrying out traffic rectification activities in the Huanggangsi area of Zhengmi Road. This connects to the entrance of the Zhengshi Expressway, where large trucks and long-distance coaches often gather, and the pick-up and drop-off of passengers by coaches also attracts many motorized tricycles for soliciting passengers, making the Zhengmi Road, which was already busy, even less smooth. The police officers were directing traffic and checking for illegal vehicles at the intersection. Half an hour later, the police seized the vehicles of seven drivers, four of whom were driving without a license, one of whom was driving without a driver's license, one of whom was driving in the wrong direction, and one of whom was driving with goods but not closing the rear door. Then, the seven drivers were taken to the traffic police Detachment 3, Chunhui Road Accident Parking Lot for handling. The accident car should attend a warning class first, according to Zheng Minjun, a traffic police officer, according to the traffic law, driving without a license will be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 1,500 yuan. If this standard is applied, five people will face severe punishment. But in fact, the traffic police did not deal with them in a simple way of fines and detention, but focused on criticism and education. Inside the accident parking lot, police officer Zheng Minjun led seven people to the side of a wrecked accident car and told them that on November 21, a Dongfeng truck on Zhengmi Road illegally overtook from the right front and collided with a BYD F3 sedan, which was torn in half, and the driver of the sedan died on the spot. And the truck driver also paid a heavy price for his actions. Many accidents are caused by our illegal driving, and this is a very painful lesson in front of us. Zheng Minjun said. After passing the test to exempt from detention, the police officer gave each person a piece of paper to write a ""story"" of the accident, divided into four parts. Moreover, the traffic police also read out the scoring criteria, with a passing score of 60 points, and passing would exempt them from detention. The scoring criteria are as follows: the first part is clean handwriting and fluent language, 10 points; the second part is to characterize one's own illegal behavior, which should be comprehensive and accurate, 30 points; the third part is to take measures to correct the behavior, which should be clear in thought, 30 points; the fourth part is the consequences of illegal behavior, which should be recognized in place, 30 points. My name is Hu Tingjie. I was checked by the traffic police on the morning of April 4. I don't have a driver's license and I violated the law. I will definitely learn from this experience and drive safely in the future. This is a segment of the ""story"" written by Hu Tingjie, who wrote very attentively after graduating from elementary school. Say whatever you want, I am really wrong, I will definitely change in the future. The driver Su Jianguo said. Actually, the scoring is just a formality, and the main thing is to see how they behave. As a management approach for traffic police, drivers with a good attitude of admitting mistakes can be punished less or not at all. Traffic police Zheng Minjun said, and this is equivalent to a guarantee, if they are caught by traffic police again, they will be dealt with according to the law."

瀚民看盘：资金有选择地进场上周冲高遇阻之后，为什么调整很难大幅展开？答：今年上半年的时候，市场呈现下跌盘整再下跌的态势，大家都盼着有反弹，但盘整就是反弹；7月初行情出现转机之后，盘整是不是就可以代替大幅回调，这是值得关注的。一般来说，在一个以老股民为主的市场氛围中，横盘等于就是调整。所以，目前的市场恐怕不会出现过于剧烈的调整。周一上午盘面似乎又有新的买盘进场，是否可以看着又有增量资金介入了呢？答：能够推动指数上扬，肯定是由资金介入造成的。不过，同两个星期以前相比，现在市场资金是有选择地进场，这跟前一段时间的情况是完全不同的。场外资金选择怎样的股票进入的呢？答：从最近两周的情况来看，农林牧渔以及食品饮料是资金注入比较明显的地方。除此之外，周一上海重组股又风起云涌，这说明重组题材也是近期资金介入的一条主线。总的来看，一是通胀，二是重组，这恐怕在未来一段时间都是我们关注的重点。中期市场的趋势怎样？答：7月初行情出现了拐点，经过短暂的逼空拉升之后，近期进行修复整理。由于短期市场迅速积累起了大量的获利筹码，估计这种消化整理的过程会比较长，不大可能再次出现逼空的态势。如果是这样的话，在保持对市场趋势坚定信心的同时，从操作层面上说，应当保持克制。看中的股票要坚持低吸进场的原则。郭勇斌(瀚民)已有_COUNT_条评论我要评论	瀚民,郭勇斌	正向	Hanmin Watch: Although the funds entered the market selectively last week, why is it difficult for the adjustment to be significantly expanded after the market's upward push was blocked? Answer: In the first half of this year, the market showed a pattern of falling, consolidating, and then falling again. Everyone was looking forward to a rebound, but consolidation was a rebound; it is worth noting whether consolidation can replace a large correction after the market turned around in early July. Generally speaking, in a market atmosphere dominated by veteran shareholders, consolidation is equivalent to adjustment. So, the current market is unlikely to experience a sharp adjustment. On Monday morning, it seems that there are new buyers entering the market. Can we see that there is more capital flowing in? The answer is that the rise in the index must be caused by the intervention of funds. But, compared with two weeks ago, the market is now selectively entering, which is completely different from the situation in the previous period. What kind of stocks do off-exchange funds choose to enter? Answer: In the past two weeks, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, as well as food and beverages, are places where capital injection is more obvious. In addition, the Shanghai reorganization stocks were active on Monday, indicating that the reorganization theme is also a main line of capital intervention in the recent period. Overall, inflation and restructuring will probably be the focus of our attention for some time to come. What is the trend in the medium-term market? The answer is that the trend turned around at the beginning of July, and after a brief forced push, it has been repaired and adjusted in the recent period. Due to the large number of profit-taking positions that have accumulated in the short-term market, it is estimated that the consolidation process will be relatively long and it is unlikely to see a squeeze again. If that is the case, while maintaining a firm confidence in market trends, we should be prudent from an operational perspective. Stick to the principle of buying at low prices for the stocks you are interested in. Guo Yongbin(Han Min) has received _COUNT_comments. I want to comment.
货币基金将被实时监控杜绝片面追求收益和规模⊙本报记者徐婧婧昨日，中国证监会与中央国债登记结算有限责任公司签署合作监管备忘录，再次加强对货币市场基金的监管。据悉，在双方签署备忘录后，中债登将向中国证监会提供货币市场基金的交易数据，以便证监会能够实时监控货币市场基金在操作上的异常情况，从而及时监管。事实上，2008年下半年以来，货币市场基金规模出现迅猛扩张，为此，证监会曾于11月17日做出风险提示，严禁基金公司采用“长券短做”“藏券”等违规操作，杜绝片面追求收益率和基金规模的做法。天相数据统计显示，2008年末，货币市场基金占全部基金净值的比例从3.39%上升到20.63%。相较于股票市场的价格主要通过公开竞价，货币市场交易产品价格受到人为因素影响的可能性较大，此次证监会与中债登合作推出的监控系统或将解决上述难题。根据新系统，如果双方交易价格严重偏离由长期收益率曲线决定的价格区间，将被纳入预警范围，该交易产品的交易双方、转移路径都会被监测。一旦发现违反规则的操作行为，证监会将对其进行不同程度的惩罚。	徐婧婧	正向	"Money market funds will be monitored in real time to prevent one-sided pursuit of returns and scale.⊙The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the Central Bond Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. signed a cooperation memorandum yesterday to strengthen the supervision of money market funds again. It is reported that after the MOU was signed, ChinaBond will provide money market fund transaction data to CSRC, so that CSRC can monitor the abnormal operations of money market funds in real time, and thus regulate them in a timely manner. In fact, since the second half of 2008, the scale of money market funds has expanded rapidly. In response, the CSRC issued a risk warning on November 17, prohibiting fund companies from engaging in irregular operations such as ""long-term bonds short-term operations"" and ""hiding bonds"", and eliminating the practice of片面追求收益率 and fund scale. According to Tianxiang data statistics, the proportion of money market funds in the net value of all funds rose from 3.39% at the end of 2008 to 20.63%. While the prices in the stock market are mainly determined through public bidding, the prices of trading products in the money market are more likely to be influenced by human factors. The monitoring system launched by CSRC in cooperation with ChinaBond may solve the above problems. Under the new system, if the trading price between both parties deviates significantly from the price range determined by the long-term yield curve, it will be included in the warning scope, and both parties of the trading product and the transfer path will be monitored. The CSRC will punish the violation of rules to different degrees once such behavior is discovered."
安全专家称苹果iPad存在安全问题【赛迪网讯】1月29日消息，据国外媒体报道，一位移动安全专家星期四说，苹果新的iPad平板电脑可能存在影响iPhone(手机上网)手机的同样的加密薄弱的安全问题。移动安全公司SMobileSystem的首席技术官DanielHoffman说，如果iPad使用iPhone手机相同的加密方式，包括手机号码和电子邮件地址在内的敏感的个人数据就会被人窃取和查看。Hoffman说，iPhone安全加密问题基本上是没有任何价值的。这个加密措施很容易绕过去。第二，如果iPad用户从苹果应用程序商店获得自己的应用程序，他们就有偶尔得到恶意软件的风险。他指出，苹果应用程序商店一直存在恶意软件。Hoffman说，此外，iPad还会像其它使用不安全的WiFi网络的设备一样遭到中间人攻击。SMobile正在开发一个防御这种攻击的工具。在这种攻击中，攻击者能够拦截移动设备通过WiFi网络发送的互联网通讯，同时假冒通讯中的合法的一方注入新的信息。他说，iPad还存在管理能力问题，如选择使用PIN或者口令代码、一旦丢失或者被窃之后远程锁死和删除功能等。iPhone提供帮助查找丢失的手机和远程删除数据的功能，但是，这项服务非常昂贵，每年收费100美元。苹果发言人没有对这个消息发表评论。作者：天虹	DanielHoffman,天虹	负向	Security experts say that the iPad has security problems [China Daily] On January 29, foreign media reported that a mobile security expert said on Thursday that Apple's new iPad tablet computer may have the same encryption weak security problems as the iPhone (mobile Internet) phone. Daniel Hoffman, chief technology officer of the mobile security company SMobile Systems, said that if the iPad uses the same encryption method as the iPhone, sensitive personal data, including phone numbers and email addresses, would be stolen and viewed. Hoffman said that the iPhone security encryption issue is basically worthless. This encryption measure is easy to bypass. Second, if iPad users obtain their own applications from the Apple App Store, they are at risk of occasionally getting malware. He pointed out that malicious software has always existed in the Apple App Store. Hoffman said that, in addition, the iPad would be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, like other devices that use insecure WiFi networks. SMobile is developing a tool to defend against this attack. In this attack, the attacker is able to intercept Internet communications sent by a mobile device over a WiFi network, and inject new information into the communications by masquerading as a legitimate party. He said that the iPad still has management capability issues, such as the choice of using a PIN or password code, and the remote lock and delete functions once lost or stolen. iPhone provides the ability to locate a lost phone and remotely delete data, but this service is very expensive, charging $100 per year.

金融街西单广场即将带来商务办公新体验在投资界有这么一句话“80年代看珠三角，90年代看长三角，21世纪看环渤海经济圈”。毋庸置疑，环渤海经济圈作为中国经济的第三增长极，在吸取了珠三角和长三角的经验和教训之后，城市群和经济圈的理念业已成熟，成为了中国发展最快速、最规范、最国际化的经济发展核心。在“环渤海经济圈”波澜壮阔的发展进程中，随着京津城际高速铁路的开通，规划多年的“京津一体化”已成为现实，使得北京、天津两地的各种产业得到迅速发展，吸引了世界各国顶级资源云集于此，成为中国最具发展潜力的核心所在。而“新京津”的诞生，亦促使众多嗅觉灵敏的地产大鳄纷纷北上，在“新京津”区域范围内“走马圈地”，一场轰轰烈烈的房地产开发大战在此隆重上演。古人云：善弈者，谋势，不善弈者，谋子。金融街控股集团无疑是善于“运筹帷幄”的实力房企，因为当其他房企在京津两地采取传统的“买地盖房”开发策略之际，作为国内最具城市运营理念和商业地产开发经验的金融街控股集团，却凭借将北京金融街打造成为“中国的华尔街”的深厚商业地产开发经验，以打造京津商务新地标为己任，于天津中心城区海河沿岸铸造了“华北第一高楼”津塔，在北京最具商务氛围的西单商圈缔造了金融街西单广场(论坛相册户型样板间点评地图搜索)两大地标性商务旗舰项目，成就了“双星闪耀”环渤海经济圈的非凡气势，由此上演一幕气势恢宏的商业地产开发“双城记”。作为“华北第一高楼”的津塔写字楼，高达336.9米，已于2010年1月14日正式封顶，在世界已建成的摩天大楼中排名第25位。津塔写字楼内外兼修，无论是建筑结构体系设计还是设施设备应用，都采用了国际领先技术。虽然津塔2011年才能建成入驻，但目前其已经吸引了逾50家世界500强企业前来洽谈，准备选址于此。继津塔取得令人艳羡的市场成就之后，金融街控股集团剑指北京西单商圈，在此精心打造了又一商务地标性建筑——金融街西单广场，续写全新的商务发展传奇。无可比拟的优越地理属性，是金融街西单广场领袖京城商务地产市场核心价值所在，其南接“神州第一街”长安街，东临国家政治中心中南海，西咫尺紧邻京城金融核心所在地金融街，汇集全北京各大优秀资源于一体，坐享世界级繁华成熟配套，奠定了首屈一指的商务办公氛围。同时，金融街西单广场周边聚集了长安街、西二环等城市交通主干道，并紧邻地铁一号线以及地铁4号线灵境胡同站，由此形成了快捷通达的立体交通网络系统，可迅速连接京城各大核心商圈，有利于商务活动的顺利开展。此外，对于建筑品质的精益求精，亦是金融街西单广场在竞争激烈的京城商务市场脱颖而出的又一大制胜利器。金融街西单广场特别设置了10米挑高独立大堂、独立出入口，为入驻企业营造了往来于西单繁华万象之中，静享独立办公之纯粹商务氛围。同时，其还以世界级标准，在写字楼内营造了空中生态景观休闲空间，开启绿色生态办公新潮流。而面积阔达7700平方米的标准层，则以方正规划布局、空间灵活实用、超高使用率的产品特色，满足实力企业不同的办公需求，成就顶级商务办公新体验。此外，金融街西单广场自身还配备了近5万平方米的商业设施，将以奢华购物中心、会议中心为业态规划方向，为入驻企业提供了繁华便利的商务配套。金融街西单广场的非凡品质，使其和“华北第一高楼”津塔一样，尚在建设之中却已名声在外。目前，已经有数十家实力企业意欲购买金融街西单广场作为办公所在地，其火爆的市场前景由此可见一斑。我要评论房产导航：	津塔	正向	"The West单广场 in Financial Street is about to bring a new business office experience to the investment circle. There is a saying in the investment circle, ""In the 1980s, we looked at the Pearl River Delta, in the 1990s, we looked at the Yangtze River Delta, and in the 21st century, we looked at the Bohai Rim Economic Circle."" There is no doubt that the Bohai Economic Rim, as the third growth pole of China's economy, has matured the concept of urban agglomeration and economic circle after learning from the experience and lessons of the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta, and has become the most rapid, standardized and international core of economic development in China. During the magnificent development process of the Bohai Rim Economic Circle, with the opening of the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, the long-planned ""Beijing-Tianjin Integration"" has become a reality, which has promoted the rapid development of various industries in Beijing and Tianjin, attracting the world's top resources to gather here, making it the core with the greatest potential for development in China. And the birth of the ""New Jingjin"" also prompted many astute real estate tycoons to move north, and a real estate development battle was held grandly in the ""New Jingjin"" area, where they ""walked and fenced"" the land. As the ancients said: A good chess player plans the situation, while a bad chess player plans the pieces. Financial Street Holding Group is undoubtedly a powerful real estate developer, because while other real estate developers in Beijing and Tianjin are adopting the traditional ""buy land and build houses"" development strategy, Financial Street Holding Group, as the most urban operation concept and commercial real estate development experience in China, has relied on its rich experience in commercial real estate development to create a new business landmark in the city center of Tianjin, the ""North China's first high-rise"" Jin Ta, and created two landmark business flagship projects, Financial Street Xidan Square (Forum Photos Floor Plans Model Rooms Reviews Map Search) in the most business atmosphere of Xidan business district in Beijing, achieving the magnificent momentum of ""twins shining"" in the Bohai Rim Economic Circle, and thus playing a grand commercial real estate development ""double city record"". As the tallest building in North China, JinTang Tower, with a height of 336.9 meters, was officially capped on January 14, 2010, ranking 25th among the world's tallest buildings that have been completed. Jinta office building is well-rounded, whether in the design of the building structure system or the application of facilities and equipment, it adopts international leading technology. Although JinTa was not expected to be occupied until 2011, it has already attracted more than 50 Fortune 500 companies to come for negotiations and prepare to choose this location. Following Jinza's impressive market success, Jincheng Group aimed at the Xidan business district in Beijing, carefully crafting another business landmark - Jincheng Xidan Plaza, to continue the new business development legend. Unparalleled geographical advantages are the core value of the financial street Xidan Plaza, which leads the business real estate market in Beijing. It is south of the ""first street of China"" Chang'an Street, east of the national political center Zhongnanhai, and west of the financial center of Beijing, the financial street, gathering all the excellent resources of Beijing, enjoying world-class mature facilities, and laying the foundation for the first-class business office atmosphere. Meanwhile, the financial street Xidan Plaza is surrounded by the main urban traffic arteries such as Chang'an Avenue and the West Second Ring Road, and is adjacent to Xidan Metro Line 1 and Lingjing Hutong Station of Line 4, which has formed a rapid and convenient three-dimensional traffic network system, which can quickly connect the city's major core business districts and is conducive to the smooth conduct of business activities. In addition, the pursuit of excellence in architectural quality is another key factor that enables the Financial Street Xidan Plaza to stand out in the fiercely competitive business market in Beijing. West单 Plaza in Financial Street specially sets up a 10-meter-high independent lobby and independent entrance and exit, creating a pure business atmosphere for the入驻 enterprises to enjoy the hustle and bustle of West单 while commuting. At the same time, it creates an aerial ecological landscape leisure space in the office building to the world-class standard, ushering in a new trend of green ecological office. And the standard floor with an area of 7,700 square meters is characterized by a square layout, flexible and practical space, and high utilization rate, which meets the different office needs of different strength enterprises and achieves a new experience of top-level business office. In addition, the West单广场 itself is equipped with nearly 50,000 square meters of commercial facilities, which will be planned as a luxurious shopping center and conference center, providing a bustling and convenient business support for the enterprises that enter. The exceptional quality of the West Chang'an Square in the Financial Street has made it as famous as the Jin Ta, the tallest building in North China, which is still under construction. Currently, dozens of strong enterprises are eager to buy the Financial Street Xidan Plaza as their office location, and the booming market prospects can be seen from this.

传香港警方调查中信泰富每经记者胡俊华发自上海市场昨日传出消息称，香港警方正在调查中信泰富(00267，HK)是否在炒汇交易中涉及犯罪行为。对此，中信泰富公关负责人昨日对《每日经济新闻》记者表示，截至目前，香港警方还没有与公司进行接触。此外，中信泰富并没有进一步的消息可供披露。昨日有香港媒体援引消息人士称，香港警方商业犯罪调查科正在调查中信泰富澳元外汇合约，希望查清该公司推迟6个星期后才披露炒汇巨亏155亿港元这一消息的原因。但报道指出，截至目前，这一调查仍在初步阶段，并未锁定任何可疑人物或目标。此前，香港证监会已经对此事展开调查，但尚未披露调查结果。而中信泰富在10月份爆发炒汇巨亏丑闻以来，已辞退两名负责财务的高层，此后该公司股价大跌，在母公司中信集团出手救援之后，中信泰富的股价方才企稳。	胡俊华	正向	Hong Kong police are investigating CITIC Pacific (00267, HK) for alleged criminal activities in foreign exchange trading, according to a report from Hu Junhua, a journalist from the Securities Market in Shanghai. Regarding this, the public relations officer of CITIC Pacific told The Economic Daily News that as of now, the Hong Kong police have not contacted the company. In addition, no further information is available from CITIC Pacific. Yesterday, Hong Kong media cited an insider that the Hong Kong police's commercial crime investigation unit is investigating CITIC Pacific's AUD foreign exchange contract, hoping to clarify the reason for the delay of 6 weeks in disclosing the loss of 15.5 billion Hong Kong dollars in foreign exchange speculation. But the report noted that the investigation was still in its early stages and had not identified any suspicious individuals or targets. Previously, the SFC had already launched an investigation into the matter, but had not disclosed the results of the investigation. Since CITIC Pacific suffered a huge loss from currency speculation in October, it has dismissed two senior executives responsible for finance. The company’s share price fell sharply, and only stabilized after CITIC Group came to its rescue.

下降趋势中短线反弹宜清空经过连续的下跌之后，沪指60分钟K线指标已经处于超跌状态，这种情况下预计今日有望展开盘中反弹。因沪指短线阻力位依然在2678一线，距离较为遥远，因此预计此次反弹的空间将较为有限，另外，农行破发也势必对市场做多人气造成较大的打击，鉴于这种判断，短线投资者宜乘反弹清空筹码，等待上升趋势确立或中线触底之后再恢复入市。点击进入：股市直播室-专家坐堂进行中欢迎发表评论我要评论		正向	Short-term rebound in the downward trend should be cleared. After a series of declines, the Shangzheng Index 60-minute K-line indicator is already in an oversold state. Under such circumstances, it is expected that a midday rebound may take place today. As the short-term resistance level of the Shanghai Composite Index is still around 2678, which is quite far away, it is expected that the space for this rebound will be limited. In addition, Agricultural Bank's underpricing will inevitably have a significant impact on the market's bullish sentiment. Given this judgment, short-term investors should take advantage of the rebound to clear their positions and wait for the upward trend to be established or for the mid-term bottom to be reached before re-entering the market.

中国田径最古老纪录由谁刷新17岁新星引爆冲击潮新浪体育讯　09室外赛季刚刚拉开序幕，国内田径界就传出喜讯，在广西玉林举行的全运会田径男子预选赛暨全国田径锦标赛，来自河北的17岁小将曹硕跳出17米13的惊人成绩，打破了该年龄段的世界纪录。曹硕的横空出世，使国内田径界冲击宿将邹振先保持了28岁之久的“胡子纪录”增添一丝信心。翻开中国田径全国纪录表可以发现，邹振先保持的17米34的男子三级跳远全国纪录是所有纪录中时间最长的。1981年世界杯田径赛上，邹振先以17米34的佳绩夺得一枚宝贵的银牌，这一成绩仅比金牌得主巴西名将奥利维拉少3厘米，在当年排名榜中高居第二位。其实，那次比赛邹振先跳出的实际远度不止17米34，而是17米50上下，可惜由于他穿了宽裤腿的尼龙短裤，身子还未落地，裤腿却轻轻擦着了沙坑，使成绩下降了10多厘米。邹振先的短裤为何不合身？原来世界杯田径赛不是以国家名义参赛的，而是以各大洲为参赛单位，邹振先当时身披的亚洲队战袍，并不是由国内提供的，因此衣裤尺寸出现了偏差。1981年堪称邹振先的鼎峰时期，那一年他先后以17米32、17米34两次打破亚洲纪录，前一次佳绩使他夺得世界大学生运动会冠军。随着年龄的增大，此后几年邹振先很少跳过17米大关。他自己肯定也没想到，“17米34”在全国纪录表沉睡时间超过了1/4世纪。上世纪八十年代末，陈燕平、邹四新两位新秀的涌现，使中国男子三级跳远到达了又一个高峰期。1990年在北京举行的第11届亚运会，陈燕平、邹四新两人共同演绎了亚洲三级跳远有史以来最精彩的一场角逐，邹四新跳出17米31的近九年亚洲最好成绩，距离邹振先纪录只有三厘米差距。不过，这一成绩仍没有使他登上冠军宝座，因为陈燕平跳出了惊人的17米51。可惜陈燕平完成那一跳时风速超过2米/秒的国际标准，这一成绩虽让他尝到亚运会金牌的滋味，却无法在亚洲纪录表中占据一席之地。此后几年后，随着陈燕平、邹四新走过鼎峰期，国内三级跳远整体水平明显下降，上世纪九十年代间只有曾立志跳出接近邹振先纪录的成绩——17米30。看到自己的成绩在全国纪录表岿然不动，邹振先难免心急。1997年，“邹振先三级跳远纪录挑战赛”应运而生，这项比赛目前已举办了九届。虽然号称挑战，但前七届比赛冠军成绩都没有17米大关。近两年情况明显好转，2007年举行的第八届挑战赛，年仅20岁的山东小将钟敏维以17米27的夺冠，创造了近12年来国内最好成绩。另外亚军得主湖南选手吴波也突破17米大关。去年举行的第9届比赛，吴波以17米02的成绩夺冠。其实，近几年国内涌现出的好手远不止钟敏维、吴波两人。2001年九运会，河北队选手吴冀以17.04米的成绩夺冠，这是中国选手时隔多年之后闯过17米大关。2004年起，国内涌现出一批20岁左右的小将，他们相继突破17米大关：2004年5月，河北选手李延熙在全国锦标赛暨奥运会选拔赛上，以17米09的佳绩，使自己成为国内第一位跨进17米大关的80后选手。四个月后，四川新秀顾俊杰在全国冠军赛上跳出17米23米的成绩；05赛季，李延熙将个人最好成绩提高至17米15；2006年，李延熙虽然没有创造个人最好成绩，但全年三次跃过17米大关，显示出不俗实力。这一年，“17米俱乐部”多了一位成员——浙江选手朱书靖，其成绩为17米03；07赛季是一个令人振奋的年度，该年有四人突破17米大关，分别是钟敏维、顾俊杰、吴波和朱书靖，其中钟敏维17米27的成绩在世界众选手中居第15位，相当于雅典奥运会第5名，这是中国男子三级跳远选手近10多来相当难得的战绩。目前，国内有5名现役选手最好成绩超过了17米大关，这一现象前所未有。然而，中国选手普遍存在着水平波动大的弱点，这一软肋在一定程度上制约着他们技术水平的正常发挥。如，顾俊杰04年跳出17米23的成绩，05赛季他的最好成绩仅有16米44，相差近80厘米。北京奥运会顾俊杰的表现令人大失所望，成绩仅有15米94；再如，07年令人惊喜的小将钟敏维，已有近两年时间未攻克17米大关，北京奥运会他的最好成绩仅15米59；众将中，李延熙以技术见长，成绩也最为稳定，04年至08年他有四个赛季跳过17米门槛。即便是这位技术型选手，在北京奥运会也显露出技术稳定方面的欠缺。预赛时，李延熙跳出17米30的佳绩，这一成绩是1990年后国内最好成绩之一，在奥运会预赛阶段排在众选手第三位。两天后的决赛，李延熙的表现明显不及预赛阶段，第一跳成绩仅有15米93，后两跳虽有好转，但状态出得明显偏晚，16米77的三跳最好成绩使他距离前八名仅有10厘米这米，痛失前八名的角逐。如果李延熙能达到预赛时的水平，将取得第五名的佳绩，这也是邹振先在1984年洛杉矶奥运会上取得的名次。曹硕的涌现，使挑战“邹振先纪录军团”增添一位生力军。值得一提的是，目前国内众好手均处于运动生涯的黄金时期，年龄最大的李延熙、吴波也只有25岁，国人有理由相信他们完全具备冲破三级跳远的“胡子纪录”的能力。当然，在超越“邹振先纪录”的同时，众好手还要在技术稳定性方面多下功夫，要像邹振先那样在国内外比赛持续表现出高水平比赛能力，这样中国三级跳远才会迎来一个真正的第二春。附：近五年国内“17米俱乐部”成员一览表2004年：顾俊杰(19岁，四川)17米23李延熙(20岁，河北)17米092005年：李延熙17米152006年：李延熙17米12朱书靖(21岁，浙江)17米032007年：钟敏维(20岁，山东)17米27顾俊杰17米11吴波(23岁，湖南)17米03朱书靖17米012008年：李延熙17米30吴波17米102009年：曹硕(17岁，河北)17米13(暂居今年世界排名第13位，仅有5人超越他)吴波17米06(王全立)	曹硕,邹振先,奥利维拉,陈燕平,邹四新,曾立志,钟敏维,吴波,吴冀,李延熙,顾俊杰,朱书靖,王全立	正向	"Who refreshed the oldest Chinese athletics record? A 17-year-old star triggered a wave of challenges. Sina Sports News. At the beginning of the 09 outdoor season, good news came from the domestic athletics circle. At the All-China Athletics Championships and the provincial games men's preliminary held in Yulin, Guangxi, Cao Shuo, a 17-year-old young man from Hebei, jumped 17.13 meters, breaking the world record of the age group. Cao Shuo's emergence has added a touch of confidence to the domestic athletics circle, which has been holding on to the ""beard record"" of 28 years set by veteran Zou Zhenxian. If you look at the national records of Chinese athletics, Zou Zhenxian's 17.34 meters in men's triple jump is the longest in terms of time among all the records. In the 1981 World Athletics Championships, Zou Zhenxian won a precious silver medal with a performance of 17.34 meters, which was only 3 centimeters less than that of the champion, Brazilian star Oliveira, and ranked second on the annual ranking list. Actually, Zou Zhenxian's actual long jump was not 17.34 meters, but around 17.50 meters. Unfortunately, due to his nylon shorts with wide pant legs, his body had not yet landed when the pant legs lightly brushed against the sand pit, causing the score to drop by more than 10 centimeters. Why is Zou Zhenxian's shorts not fitting? Originally, the World Athletics Championships were not participated in the name of the country, but in the name of the continents. At that time, the Asian team jersey that Zou Zhenxian was wearing was not provided by the domestic, so there was a deviation in the size of the jersey and pants. 1981 was the peak period of Zou Zhenxian, who broke the Asian record twice in 17.32 and 17.34 meters that year, and won the championship of the World University Games with the former. As he grew older, Zou Zhixian rarely jumped over 17 meters in the following years. He himself never expected that ""17.34"" would sleep for more than a quarter of a century on the national record list. In the late 1980s, the emergence of two newcomers, Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin, brought Chinese men's triple jump to another peak. The 11th Asian Games in Beijing in 1990, Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin jointly staged the most spectacular competition in the history of Asian triple jump, Zou Sixin jumped 17.31 meters, which was the best Asian performance in nearly nine years, only three centimeters away from Zou Zhenxian's record. However, this achievement still did not make him the champion, as Chen Yanping jumped an astonishing 17.51 meters. Unfortunately, Chen Yanping’s jump was disqualified for exceeding the 2 meters per second international standard for wind speed when he completed it. Although this result allowed him to taste the gold medal of the Asian Games, it could not be recorded in the Asian record. After several years, with Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin entering their prime, the overall level of the Chinese triple jump declined significantly. In the 1990s, only Zeng Lizhi jumped close to Zou Zhenxian's record of 17.30 meters. Zou Zhenxian was inevitably anxious to see his own scores unchanged on the national record sheet. In 1997, the ""Zou Zhenxian Triple Jump Record Challenge"" was born, and this competition has been held for nine sessions so far. Although it is called a challenge, the champions of the first seven competitions have not exceeded 17 meters. In the past two years, the situation has clearly improved. At the 8th Challenge held in 2007, Zhong Minwei, a young player from Shandong, won the championship with 17.27 meters at the age of 20, creating the best domestic performance in the past 12 years. Another runner-up, Wu Bo from Hunan, also broke the 17-meter barrier. Wu Bo won the 9th championship last year with a result of 17.02 meters. In fact, there are many other excellent players in China in recent years beyond Zhong Minwei and Wu Bo. In the 2001 9th Games, Wu Ji from Hebei team won the championship with a result of 17.04 meters, which was the first time that Chinese athletes had broken the 17 meters barrier after many years. Since 2004, a batch of young players in their early twenties have emerged in China, who have successively broken through the 17-meter barrier: in May 2004, Li Yanxi, a player from Hebei, achieved a performance of 17.09 meters in the National Games and the Olympic selection competition, becoming the first 80s player to enter the 17-meter barrier in China. Four months later, Gu Junjie, a new star from Sichuan, jumped 17.23 meters in the national championship; in the 05 season, Li Yanxi improved his personal best to 17.15 meters; in 2006, although Li Yanxi did not create his personal best, he jumped over 17 meters three times in the whole year, showing his outstanding strength. In this year, Zhejiang athlete Zhu Shujing, with a performance of 17.03 meters, became a member of the ""17-meter club""; in the 07 season, it was an exciting year, with four people breaking the 17-meter barrier, including Zhong Minwei, Gu Junjie, Wu Bo and Zhu Shujing. Among them, Zhong Minwei's performance of 17.27 meters was the 15th in the world, equivalent to the 5th place in the Athens Olympic Games, which was a relatively rare achievement for Chinese men's triple jump athletes in the past 10 years. Currently, there are five current players in China who have achieved a personal best of more than 17 meters, which is unprecedented. However, Chinese players generally have the weakness of large fluctuations in their level, which to some extent restricts their normal performance of technical level. For example, Gu Junjie jumped 17.23 meters in 2004, and his best result in the 2005 season was only 16.44 meters, a difference of nearly 80 centimeters. Gu Junjie's performance at the Beijing Olympics was disappointing, with a result of only 15.94 meters; similarly, the young athlete Zhong Minwei, who was a pleasant surprise in 2007, has not broken the 17-meter barrier for nearly two years, and his best result at the Beijing Olympics was only 15.59 meters. Among the team, Li Yanxi is known for his technique and has the most stable results. From 2004 to 2008, he jumped over the 17-meter mark in four seasons. Even this technically skilled player showed a lack of technical stability at the Beijing Olympics. In the preliminary round, Li Yanxi jumped 17.30 meters, which was one of the best performances in China after 1990, and ranked third among all athletes in the Olympic preliminary stage. On the final two days of the final, Li Yanxi's performance was clearly inferior to that of the preliminary stage. His first jump only scored 15.93 meters, and although his performance improved in the last two jumps, his state was clearly too late. His best score of 16.77 meters in three jumps was only 10 centimeters away from the top eight, and he missed the competition for the top eight. If Li Yanxi could reach the level of the preliminary race, he would have achieved the fifth place, which was also the ranking that Zou Zhenxian achieved in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Cao Shuo's emergence adds a new force to the challenge of ""Zou Zhenxian Record Corps"". It is worth noting that most of the domestic athletes are in the golden period of their sports career, with the oldest Li Yanxi and Wu Bo only 25 years old. Chinese people have every reason to believe that they have the ability to break the ""beard record"" of triple jump. Of course, while surpassing Zou Zhenxian's record, the athletes should also work on their technical stability, and perform at a high level in domestic and international competitions as Zou Zhenxian did, so that the Chinese triple jump can experience a true second spring.

Recently, it is said that the two are close to a good thing, and even the record producer Lei Songde urges them to get married as soon as possible, and even says that the baby they will have will be very beautiful. When Deng Lixin heard this, she did not resist, and even thanked Lei Songde with a smile, as if she had acknowledged the relationship. Yesterday, Deng Lixin, together with a group of local stars including Chan Zhaoqi, Chan Waiho, and Kwok Kinpong, went to Mong Kok to host the opening ceremony of a World Cup event held in a shopping mall.

Asked if he likes watching ball games, regarding his rumored boyfriend Fanglishen. She said, ""Sure, boys like to watch it."" As to the sudden news of her engagement, Deng Lixin joked that her friends called the hotel to inquire after reading the report, and when they found out that the hotel could only accommodate a dozen tables, they were sure that the report was not credible, as a dozen tables were not enough. Ask her how many tables she plans to set up? She smiled and said, ""I never thought about it. I don't plan for things that are too far away.""

Sina Sports. On August 16, the Chinese Football Association punished the Guangzhou Evergrande player Mu Liuqi, which dealt a heavy blow to this Brazilian foreign player who performed very well this season. Since he learned that he was punished by the Football Association, Muriqui's mood has been very bad. The Brazilian is now very regretful of the impact he has caused on the team. Mourqi said about the punishment he received: I think the punishment from the Football Association is unfair, but I can still accept and obey it. On the 16th, Muriqui was punished by both the Guangzhou Evergrande club and the Chinese Football Association, which made the usually cheerful Brazilian immediately fall into a state of distress, especially after learning that he was banned from playing for five matches, Muriqui’s mood was very bad, and he locked himself in a room for a long time. Fortunately, his wife was always by his side, encouraging him, so it was not until nearly 20 hours after the punishment that Muriqui left the room, and it was not until noon on the 17th that he ate the first meal in 20 hours. Sinan Sports also contacted Muriqi through the translation of the team of the Evergrande, Muriqi said that he wanted to thank his wife now, when he was in trouble, he was always by his side, and he was also grateful to the club, who also comforted him all the time. When it comes to the punishment I received, Mucy said: I think the punishment from the Football Association is unfair, I did not go to violent harm, but now that the punishment has been imposed, whether it is fair or not, I accept it. What I want to say is that I am grateful to the club, although the club also punished me, but I first accept the punishment of the club, I think the punishment of the club to me is to help me. Since I can accept the punishment from the club, I should also accept and obey the punishment from the FA. What made Mu Lizhi most sad was the impact of his suspension on the team: the club has always been very good to me, and has given me a lot of help in all aspects. I have always been eager to repay the club and the team with good performance, but now I cannot participate in the game, and I feel very sad. I hope that my teammates can help the team to achieve good results during my suspension. (Sina Sports Jingyi (Weibo))
八旬老太靠卖菜过活走红30年仅见国外儿子一面本报讯(记者郑磊)本该是安享晚年的年龄，85岁的周瑞英老奶奶却独自在马甸桥地下通道内卖菜。近日，这位在网络上走红的“果蔬奶奶”受到了不少关注，很多居民在下班时都会刻意路过给她捧个场。果蔬奶奶不再孤单昨天下午5点半，海淀区马甸桥东南角的地下通道外，一位头发花白、拎着布包和塑料袋的老人出现了。“这不是‘果蔬奶奶’么！”一位小伙子叫出声来。看着将要走下楼梯的老人，这位小伙子快步上前，“周奶奶，我帮您拿吧！”之后，小伙子从脸上布满微笑的周瑞英老人手里接过了蔬菜。之后，又有3位年轻人认出了老人，主动帮助她搬运蔬菜。几位年轻人放妥了蔬菜准备离去时，周奶奶弯下不太利索的身体，拿起一小袋香瓜对着几位年轻人说，“孩子，这些水果你们拿着吃吧，天热，吃点儿败火”。“我们改天买您的东西。”几位年轻人笑着离开。30年只见儿子一面还不到6点，由于还没到下班高峰，周奶奶垫了张报纸，坐在自己的摊边与记者聊起了自己的家人。老人听力不好，据她说，是年轻时候得了一场病所致，跟人说话时，老人会把左耳贴到别人嘴边。周奶奶说，身为徐州人的她年轻时跟随军官丈夫来到北京。之后，儿子还考取了清华大学，在大学毕业后，儿子前往美国攻读研究生。之后，周奶奶的儿子在国外娶妻生子，“30多年了我只见过他一回，就是他爸去世的那年”，老人低着头不断念叨着，老伴在3年前因为肺癌去世了。谈起为什么不叫儿子回来陪她，老人摆摆手说：“回来一趟太贵了，我自己能活。”在对话中，每次谈到儿子，老人的语气和神态明显低落很多。老人还补充说自己年轻时还生过一个女儿，但很快就送人了。市民捧场老人繁忙晚上6点，过往的行人渐渐增多，周奶奶的地摊也红火起来。除了不断前来买菜的市民外，十几位年轻人来到周奶奶的摊位前，“果蔬奶奶，我们来买点儿水果”。“你们都是下班路过的吗？”面对突然增多的年轻人，周奶奶有些不适应。“我们是路过的。”对方答道。“这个豇豆可以煮着吃，也可以焯一下蘸酱吃。”卖每种果蔬时老人都会多嘱咐几句。记者随后了解到，这群年轻人是北京的一些网友，他们相约前来为周奶奶捧场特意组织的队伍。在场的每个人都或多或少买了一些果蔬，不少人把最后的零头都留给了老人，称这也算是一种救济。只想平平淡淡卖菜据了解，老人有三个愿望。一是配一副眼镜，能更多地看清大家的面孔；二是买一个助听器，能听清楚顾客们说的话；三是想镶几颗牙齿，能把饭菜更好地嚼烂，吃得更香一些。周瑞英老人说，这几天，她发现来买果蔬的人比以前多了，很多人还会叫她“果蔬奶奶”，经询问才得知这是网友给她起的名字。“这是我这辈子第一个外号。”对于这个名字，老人笑着说。老人同时表示，虽然有媒体前来采访，但她并不在乎，她只是希望给下班晚买不上蔬菜水果的人们提供一个便宜、方便的场所。“平平淡淡地经营挺好。”她说。■对话·首发微博者庆幸自己帮到老人京华时报：当初是怎么想到发这条微博的？程小撑：当天我是碰巧路过，看到老人的第一眼很震撼，感觉跟自己的姥姥很像，觉得有必要帮她一下。京华时报：现在已经有不少网友关注并前来为老奶奶捧场，你怎么想？程小撑：当初只是想着能让住在周围的人关注一下，没想到反响这么大，我觉得我的目的达到了，挺开心的。京华时报：现在老人的菜摊，有时会突然出现一批人来买老人的菜，有没有想过太多人可能会影响老人的生活？程小撑：这个真没想过，一条微博转发万次以上并不少见，可是引起这么大的效应出乎我的意料。希望大家不会太影响老人吧。	郑磊,周瑞英,周奶奶,程小撑	正向	"An 85-year-old grandmother, Zhou Ruiying, has been selling vegetables in the underground passage of Maidian Bridge for 30 years, and has only seen her son from abroad once. According to a report by Zheng Lei, a reporter, she should have enjoyed her old age, but she has been selling vegetables alone in the underground passage of Maidian Bridge. Recently, the ""fruit and vegetable grandma"" who became popular on the Internet has attracted a lot of attention, and many residents will deliberately pass by to give her a show when they get off work. The grandma of fruits and vegetables is no longer lonely. Yesterday at 5:30 PM, an elderly person with white hair, carrying a cloth bag and a plastic bag, appeared at the southeast corner of Maidian Bridge in Haidian District. Isn't this the grandma of fruits and vegetables! A young man called out. Seeing the old man about to walk down the stairs, the young man hurried forward, ""Aunt Zhou, let me help you!"" Afterwards, the young man took the vegetables from the elderly Zhou Ruiying, whose face was full of smiles. Then three more young people recognized the old man and offered to help carry the vegetables for her. When a few young people put the vegetables in place and were about to leave, Aunt Zhou, with her body not very flexible, bent over and took a small bag of melons and said to the few young people, ""Children, take these fruits and eat them. It's hot, eat a little to clear the fire."" We will buy your things some other day. Several young people left with a smile. She saw her son only once in 30 years, and it was before 6 o'clock. Since it was not yet rush hour, Old Mrs. Zhou sat on a newspaper and chatted with the reporter about her family. The old man's hearing was not good, she said, it was caused by a disease he had when he was young. When talking to people, the old man would press his left ear to the other person's mouth. Mrs. Zhou said that as a native of Xuzhou, she came to Beijing with her military officer husband when she was young. Then, the son was admitted to Tsinghua University. After graduating from university, he went to the United States to pursue a master's degree. Then, Zhou’s son married and had children abroad. “I have only seen him once in 30 years, that was the year his father passed away,” the old woman said, her head bowed, repeating the words. Her spouse passed away three years ago due to lung cancer. When asked why she did not call her son back to accompany her, the old man waved his hand and said, ""It's too expensive to come back, I can live by myself."" During the conversation, the old man's tone and demeanor were noticeably more depressed each time he talked about his son. The old man also added that he had a daughter when he was young, but she was soon given away. The citizens flocked to the stall of the elderly woman, who was busy by 6 p.m. as the number of passers-by gradually increased, and Zhou Nainai's stall became more prosperous. Besides the citizens who came to buy vegetables and fruits continuously, more than ten young people came to Zhou Nainai's stall and said, ""Old Nainai of fruits and vegetables, we want to buy some fruits."" Are you all on your way home from work? Faced with the sudden increase in young people, Old Mrs. Zhou was a bit unaccustomed. We are just passing by. He replied. This yardlong bean can be eaten by boiling, or blanched and dipped in sauce. The old man would always give a few more words of advice when selling each kind of fruit and vegetable. The reporters later learned that the group of young people were some netizens from Beijing, who had come together to cheer for Grandma Zhou, and they had specially organized a team. Everyone there bought some fruits and vegetables to some extent, and many people left the last scraps to the old man, calling it a kind of relief. She only wants to sell vegetables in a plain way. It is said that the old man has three wishes. One is to get a pair of glasses to see everyone's face more clearly; two is to buy a hearing aid to hear what the customers say clearly; three is to want to have a few teeth inlaid to chew food better and eat more deliciously. Old Zhou Ruiying said that in recent days, she had noticed that more people were coming to buy fruits and vegetables than before, and many people would even call her ""Grandma Fruit and Vegetable."" It was only after asking that she learned that this was a nickname given to her by netizens. This is my first nickname in my whole life. The old man smiled and said about that name. The old man also said that although the media came to interview her, she did not care, and she just wanted to provide a cheap and convenient place for people who could not buy vegetables and fruits when they got off work late. It's nice to run things in a plain and simple way. She said. ■ Conversation · The first person to tweet was grateful for helping the old man. Beijing Times: How did you come up with the idea of posting this tweet? Cheng Xiaozheng: I happened to pass by that day, and I was very impressed when I saw the old man for the first time, feeling that he was very similar to my grandmother, and felt that I should help her. The Jinghua Times: Now, there are already quite a few netizens who are paying attention and coming to support the old lady. What do you think? Cheng Xiaozheng: At first, I just wanted the people around me to pay attention, but I didn't expect such a big response. I think I have achieved my goal, and I'm very happy. The Beijing Times: Sometimes, a lot of people will come to buy the old man's vegetables. Have you thought about whether too many people might affect the old man's life? Cheng Xiaozheng: I never thought about it. It's not uncommon for a microblog to be forwarded more than 10,000 times, but the effect it caused was beyond my expectation. I hope it won't disturb the elderly too much."

阿桑奇强奸等罪若确认将被引渡到瑞典判刑当地时间12月7日，维基解密创始人兼主编朱利安·阿桑奇被伦敦警方逮捕。维基解密立即对此表示抗议，并强调会采取应对行动。早些时候，瑞典警方以涉嫌强奸和性骚扰等罪名，向整个欧洲乃至全球发出了针对阿桑奇的通缉令。律师否认阿桑奇自首12月7日，英国伦敦警方对媒体公布了一份声明，称维基解密创始人兼主编阿桑奇在当天9时30分左右被捕。该声明强调，逮捕是基于瑞典发出的欧洲通用通缉令作出的。本月2日，瑞典向欧洲和全球发出了通缉令，指控阿桑奇涉嫌强奸和性骚扰。当时，阿桑奇已经来到英国伦敦。英方随后约见阿桑奇的律师，向其表达了将会逮捕阿桑奇的立场。阿桑奇的律师强烈谴责逮捕行为，并否认媒体盛传的阿桑奇可能自首的消息。现年39岁的澳大利亚人阿桑奇被瑞典警方指控，在今年8月犯下强奸罪以及对两位女士实施性骚扰。不过，阿桑奇对此一直予以否认，并谴责瑞典警方的指控带有政治目的。引渡可能经历数月依据媒体透露的消息，阿桑奇在当地时间7日晚些时候将在伦敦威斯敏斯特法庭出庭受审。报道称，如果法庭最终认为阿桑奇犯罪事实证据确凿，他将被引渡到瑞典判刑。在法官作出引渡判决之前，阿桑奇将被羁押在英国，同时也存在被保释的可能。从定罪到引渡的整个过程可能将持续数月之久。自上周以来，维基解密麻烦不断，包括该机构的瑞士银行账号被注销、信用卡付款平台被封、网站被攻击等。美国政府甚至发起了针对维基解密以及阿桑奇本人的犯罪调查，指控其威胁到美国的国家安全和全球的外交行动。尽管阿桑奇被捕，然而维基解密发言人克里斯丁·哈拉夫森评论说，维基解密强烈谴责逮捕阿桑奇的行为，并表示会坚持既有的公布秘密文件的行动。(张乐)英媒体爆料维基解密创始人同时与两名女性有染维基解密创始人成长历程揭秘：幼时颠沛流离	阿桑奇,朱利安·阿桑奇,克里斯丁·哈拉夫森,张乐	正向	If Assange is confirmed guilty of rape and other crimes, he will be extradited to Sweden for sentencing. On December 7, Julian Assange, the founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, was arrested by London police. Wikileaks immediately protested and emphasized that it would take countermeasures. Earlier, Swedish police issued an international warrant for Assange’s arrest on suspicion of rape and sexual harassment, among other crimes, across Europe and around the world. The lawyer denied that Assange had turned himself in. On December 7, the London police released a statement to the media that Assange, the founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, was arrested around 9:30 a.m. on that day. The statement emphasizes that the arrest was made on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant issued by Sweden. On February 2, Sweden issued an arrest warrant to Europe and the world, accusing Assange of rape and sexual harassment. At that time, Assange had arrived in London, UK. The British then met with Assange’s lawyers to express their intention to arrest him. Assange's lawyer strongly condemned the arrest and denied the media reports that Assange would surrender himself. Australian Assange, 39, was accused by Swedish police of rape and sexual harassment of two women in August. However, Assange has always denied this and condemned the Swedish police’s charges as politically motivated. The extradition could take months, and according to media reports, Assange is scheduled to appear in the Westminster court in London later that evening. It was reported that if the court eventually found the evidence of Assange's crime solid, he would be extradited to Sweden for sentencing. Assange will be detained in the UK before the judge makes the extradition ruling, and there is also a possibility of bail. The entire process from conviction to extradition may take several months. Since last week, WikiLeaks has been in trouble, including the cancellation of its Swiss bank account, the closure of the credit card payment platform, and the attack on the website. The U.S. government even launched criminal investigations into WikiLeaks and Assange himself, accusing them of threatening the national security of the United States and the country’s foreign policy actions around the world. Despite Assange's arrest, WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson commented that WikiLeaks strongly condemned the arrest of Assange and that they would continue with their existing actions to publish secret documents.

叶尚志：回调幅度已接近安全边际■港股手记⊙第一上海证券叶尚志○编辑杨晓坤11月10日，港股继续整固调整的态势，连跌了第二个交易日。从盘面上来看，市况还不至于全面向淡。事实上，我们相信港股正处于强势调整当中，建议可以把握低买的机会。内地将在今天公布一系列经济数据，最引人注目的肯定是10月份消费物价指数(CPI)，市场普遍预期会进一步上升至4%。另一方面，二十国集团G20高峰会也会在今天召开，这个对于美元走势以及资金流向，都会构成关键影响。恒生指数昨日呈现反复调整，下压到了24400点关口水平后打横，在填补了最近一个跳升缺口24550至24733点区间的背景下，我们估计港股的承接力会有逐步增强的机会。恒生指数收盘报24501点，下跌210点，主板成交量有1092亿多元。技术上，恒生指数目前水平的安全边际已经提高了，在调整了两天之后，股指跟平均线组合的偏离幅度已出现了改善。另一方面，在美联局落实推出二度量化宽松之后，恒生指数的爆发起点是在24145点，也就是上周三的收盘价。倘若市场对于二度量宽的信心未有变化，恒生指数应该不会跌回到24145点以下。中国人民银行宣布调高存款准备金率0.5个百分点，本月16日正式生效。消息对于实体经济的影响应该较大，相信是属于调控过度泛滥流动性为主，并不是打压举动。而内银股经过了近期的回整后，调整幅度平均已有5%，相信股价的支撑力有逐步增强的机会。值得关注的是，内地保险股出现了逆市走高的行程，内地进入加息周期，对于保险股的利息收入会有提升空间。中国平安(2318)涨了3.6%，中国财险(2328)涨了0.17%，中国太保(2601)涨了3.13%。	叶尚志,杨晓坤	正向	Ye Shangzhi: The correction has approached the safety margin ■ Hong Kong Stock Market Diary ⊙ First United Securities Ye Shangzhi ○ Editor Yang Xiaokun On November 10, the Hong Kong stock market continued to consolidate and adjust, falling for the second consecutive trading day. From the chart, the market situation is not yet fully bearish. In fact, we believe that the Hong Kong market is in a strong consolidation, and it is recommended to seize the opportunity to buy at a low price. The mainland will release a series of economic data today, the most eye-catching of which is the consumer price index (CPI) for October, which is expected to rise further to 4%. On the other hand, the G20 summit will also be held today, which will have a key impact on the trend of the US dollar and the flow of funds. The Hang Seng Index showed a fluctuating adjustment yesterday, pressing down to the level of 24,400 points, and then sideways. After filling the recent upward gap between 24,550 and 24,733 points, we estimate that the承接力 of Hong Kong stocks will have the opportunity to gradually increase. The Hang Seng Index closed at 24,501 points, down 210 points, with turnover on the main board at 109.2 billion yuan. Technically, the safety margin of the Hang Seng Index at the current level has been improved after two days of adjustment, and the deviation of the index from the moving average has improved. On the other hand, after the Fed implemented the second round of quantitative easing, the starting point of the explosion of the Hang Seng Index was 24,145 points, which was the closing price of last Wednesday. If the market's confidence in the second round of quantitative easing does not change, the Hang Seng Index should not fall below 24,145 points. The People's Bank of China announced an increase in the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points, which will take effect officially on the 16th of this month. The impact of the message on the real economy should be significant, and it is believed to be mainly due to excessive and excessive liquidity regulation, rather than a suppression move. After the recent consolidation of the shares of the domestic banks, the adjustment has averaged 5%, and it is believed that there is a chance for the support of the stock price to gradually strengthen. Notably, the insurance stocks in the mainland have risen against the trend, and the mainland is entering an interest rate hike cycle, which will increase the interest income of insurance stocks. China Ping An (2318) rose 3.6%, China Property & Casualty (2328) rose 0.17%, and China Taiping (2601) rose 3.13%.
价格太高中国连续两周未进口美国大豆卢进高企的美国大豆价格正在令买家望而却步。在截至6月4日的两周内，全球最大的大豆进口国——中国已经没有出现在美国大豆买家的列表当中，不仅如此，在过去的两周内，中国还将此前确定的进口量削减了十多万吨。昨日，美国农业部(USDA)公布了截至6月4日的一周出口销售报告，当周美国2008/2009年度(2008年9月1日起)大豆净出口销售量为-6.1万吨，远远低于此前分析师预计的20万~30万吨水平。在这一周内，中国削减进口量5.5万吨。而在截至5月28日的一周内，美国大豆出口量同样也为负值。当周，大豆净出口量为-2.4万吨，中国削减进口11.26万吨。今年以来，由于美国大豆价格相对便宜，阿根廷大豆产量因干旱原因大幅减少，包括中国在内的大豆进口国对美国大豆的需求高涨。据USDA统计，截至5月28日，美国2008/2009年度大豆累计出口销售量为3373.63万吨，去年同期为3001.43万吨。中国累计购买美豆1846.91万吨，去年同期为1342.67万吨。美国大豆的“疯狂”出口使得该国大豆库存快速下降，USDA周三的月度报告预计，2008/2009年度，美国大豆期末库存仅1.1亿蒲式耳(约合300万吨)，这将是1973年以来的最低库存量。在库存吃紧的情况下，美国大豆在过去三个月内快速上涨，截至昨日北京时间22点，芝加哥商品交易所(CBOT)大豆7月合约期价报1260美分/蒲式耳，较3月中旬上涨了近45%。此前便宜的美国大豆，现在变得非常昂贵。据黑龙江天琪期货估算，如果按照目前的大豆期货价格点价进口，美国大豆到达中国港口的成本价将高达4300元/吨，这远远高于3600~3800元/吨的国产大豆价格。在高企的大豆价格面前，中国只好对美国大豆“退避三舍”。	卢进高	正向	"The high US soybean prices are deterring buyers from importing US soybeans to China for two consecutive weeks. In the two weeks ending on June 4, the world’s largest importer of soybeans, China, was no longer on the list of US soybean buyers, and in the past two weeks, China has also reduced its previously determined imports by more than 100,000 tons. Yesterday, the USDA released the export sales report for the week ending June 4, and the net soybean export sales for the 2008/2009 marketing year (starting from September 1, 2008) was -61,000 tons, far below the 200,000-300,000 tons expected by analysts. In this week, China cut its imports by 55,000 tons. And the U.S. soybean exports were also negative for the week ending May 28. For the week, net soybean exports were -24,000 tons, and China reduced its imports by 112,600 tons. So far this year, due to relatively cheap US soybean prices, the soybean harvest in Argentina has sharply decreased due to drought, and the demand for US soybeans from soybean importing countries including China has been high. According to USDA, as of May 28, the cumulative soybean export sales of the 2008/2009 marketing year in the United States were 33.7363 million tons, while the same period last year was 30.0143 million tons. China's cumulative purchases of US soybeans reached 18.4691 million tons, while it was 13.4267 million tons in the same period last year. The ""crazy"" exports of US soybeans have led to a rapid decline in US soybean stocks, and the USDA's monthly report on Wednesday predicts that at the end of the 2008/2009 crop year, US soybean stocks will be only 110 million bushels (about 3 million tons), which will be the lowest stock level since 1973. With tight inventory, US soybeans have risen rapidly in the past three months, and as of yesterday at 10:00 PM Beijing time, the July contract price of soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was 1260 cents/bushel, up nearly 45% from mid-March. Previously cheap US soybeans are now very expensive. According to Heilongjiang Tianqi Futures, if American soybeans are imported at the current soybean futures price, the cost price at Chinese ports will be as high as 4,300 yuan per ton, which is far higher than the domestic soybean price of 3,600-3,800 yuan per ton. In the face of high soybean prices, China can only retreat from American soybeans."
期指新老空军司令分歧加大□晨报记者张佳?昨日A股在权重股带领下小幅微调，沪深300指数下跌15点，跌幅为0.43%，最终报收于3466.08点。而期指合约表现大体与现货相若。近期合约方面，IF1011合约下跌23点，跌幅为0.64%，报收3558.20点，期现货价差跌破100点报收92.12点，全日共成交235559张，未平仓合约数为29142张，较上一交易日减少1384张；IF1012合约则下跌21.40点，跌幅0.59%，报收3591.60点，期现货价差为125.52点，全日共成交13614张，未平仓合约数为7798张，较上一交易日增加247张。远期合约方面，IF1103合约下跌20.20点，跌幅0.55%，报收3655点，期现货价差为188.92点，全日共成交1377张，未平仓合约数为2198张，较上一交易日增加283张；IF1106合约则下跌13.8点，跌幅为0.37%，报收3710.4点，期现货价差为244.32点，全日共成交251张，未平仓合约数为456张，较上一交易日增加48张。从昨日主力合约IF1011合约的期现货价差日内走势来看，高企不下的期现货价差值终于因为昨日下午的一波小幅跳水而有所缩窄。昨天上午，期现货价差大多数时间是在105点至135点之间盘整，但到下午跳水后，一度最低不过85点左右，虽然此后由于沪深300指数并未继续跳水期现货价差有所回升，但是也不过是在95点至105点之间盘整。虽然期现货价差收窄，但是对套利者而言依然有2.66%的套利空间，考虑到这是不足一个月的套利收益，还是极为可观的。中金所披露的持仓数据显示，昨日老牌“空军司令”国泰君安持有的多单为2264张，较上一交易日减少70张；持有的空单为5232张，较上一交易日减少260张，净空单数减少190张至2968张。至于新锐“空军司令”中证期货，持有的多单为1843张，较上一交易日锐减464张，持有的空单为5643张，较上一交易日增加71张，净空单数增加535张至3800张。对于后市，新老“空军司令”出现了分歧，国泰君安虽然并没有积极做多，但至少在减少总头寸的同时略微偏多，而中证期货却是在大举减持空单的同时轻微增持空单，看空的意味要明显强于国泰君安。	张佳	正向	"The new and old air force commanders have greater differences in the index. Zhang Jia, a reporter from the morning paper, yesterday, the A-share market was slightly adjusted under the leadership of heavyweights, the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index fell 15 points, a decline of 0.43%, and finally closed at 3466.08 points. And the performance of the futures contract was roughly similar to that of the spot. For the recent contracts, IF1011 fell 23 points, or 0.64%, closing at 3558.20 points. The premium of the futures and spot markets fell below 100 points, closing at 92.12 points. The total trading volume for the day was 235,559 contracts, with 29,142 open contracts, a decrease of 1,384 contracts from the previous trading day. IF1012 fell 21.40 points, or 0.59%, closing at 3591.60 points. The premium of the futures and spot markets was 125.52 points. The total trading volume for the day was 13,614 contracts, with 7,798 open contracts, an increase of 247 contracts from the previous trading day. For the forward contract, IF1103 fell 20.20 points, or 0.55%, closing at 3655 points. The difference between the futures and spot prices was 188.92 points. The total volume of transactions for the day was 1,377 contracts, with 2,198 unsettled contracts, an increase of 283 contracts from the previous trading day. IF1106 fell 13.8 points, or 0.37%, closing at 3710.4 points. The difference between the futures and spot prices was 244.32 points. The total volume of transactions for the day was 251 contracts, with 456 unsettled contracts, an increase of 48 contracts from the previous trading day. From the intraday movement of the premium/discount between the main contract IF1011 and the spot price yesterday, the premium/discount value, which was high, was finally narrowed due to a slight drop in the afternoon of yesterday. The spread between the futures and spot prices mostly oscillated between 105 points and 135 points in the morning of yesterday, but it dropped sharply in the afternoon, reaching a low of around 85 points. Although the spread recovered somewhat after that due to the fact that the CSI 300 index did not continue to drop, it still oscillated between 95 points and 105 points. Although the spread between futures and spot prices has narrowed, arbitrageurs still have a 2.66% arbitrage opportunity. Considering that this is the arbitrage return in less than a month, it is still quite impressive. The open interest data disclosed by the China Financial Futures Exchange shows that Guotai Junan, the veteran ""Air Force Commander"", held 2,264 long positions, down 70 from the previous trading day; it held 5,232 short positions, down 260 from the previous trading day, and the net short positions decreased by 190 to 2,968. As for the new ""Air Force Commander"" Zhongzheng Futures, the long position held was 1,843 contracts, a sharp reduction of 464 contracts from the previous trading day, the short position held was 5,643 contracts, an increase of 71 contracts from the previous trading day, and the net short position increased by 535 contracts to 3,800 contracts. For the future, the new and old ""Air Force Commanders"" have different views. Guotai Junan did not take a positive position, but at least reduced the total position while slightly increasing the position, while Zhongzeng Futures was significantly reducing the short positions while slightly increasing the short positions, and the implication of being bearish was much stronger than Guotai Junan."

中国电信SP管理具行业示范效应-本报记者余祖江信息产业部通报显示，今年第二季度，涉及SP收费争议方面的用户申诉共计1421件，比上季度下降7.85%，继续呈稳步下降趋势。其中，相关基础电信企业负责为SP企业提供接入服务和收费的，涉及中国电信58件，比上季度下降29.27%。在四大运营商中，中国电信SP被投诉最少。对于SP的管理，基础电信企业责无旁贷。随着增值业务的日趋繁荣，SP市场规范化运行的重要性凸显。未来的竞争是产业链之间的竞争，信息服务的提供需要共同做大产业链。针对SP监管得力虽然申诉总体下降明显，但是相对比较集中。数据显示，涉及中国移动789件，比上季度下降2.11%；涉及中国联通516件，比上季度下降13.71%；涉及中国网通58件，比上季度上升3.57%。目前，根据“谁接入谁负责”的原则，主要是由基础电信企业负责管理相关SP。对涉及中国电信的SP投诉较少，在一定程度上表明中国电信对于SP的监管取得了成效。2007年，信息产业部确立了“三谁原则”，即“谁主管谁负责”，“谁经营谁负责”，“谁接入谁负责”，旨在明确各环节责任，消除责任死角，规范电信信息服务管理。为此，中国电信针对互联网、声讯、小灵通短信等各类合作业务，建立了一系列规章制度，对SP的网络接入、内容审核、代收费管理、经营考核等各方面实行严格把关，以确保合作伙伴提供合法、健康的内容。比如，中国电信建立所接入SP的信誉积分管理制度，将合作SP违规行为纳入企业间合作管理范围。固网增值业务待挖潜根据信息产业部电信研究院的统计和估算，截至2006年12月底，我国增值电信业务市场总规模超过1560亿元，预计2007年将超过1600亿元。无疑，增值业务市场是一座“金矿”。与移动增值业务相比，固网增值业务的市场规模较小。我国现有的增值业务，按照收入排名，依次为信息服务、ISP、IDC与呼叫中心等，而在信息服务收入中，移动信息服务占了75%的份额，互联网信息服务为23%，电话信息服务则为2%。显然，移动网对于SP更具吸引力，但是，固网同样有吸引并留住SP的理由。固网增值业务仍有很大的增长空间。包括IPTV、固话手机一号通、宽带、其他SP提供的增值业务等，这就是未来的新价值空间。移动信息服务是趋势移动增值业务发展迅速，已成为电信运营商业务收入增长的主要拉动力量。财报显示，今年上半年，中移动的增值业务收入较去年同期上升35.5%至419.15亿元，占总营运收入比例达25.5%。作为移动增值业务产业价值链中的重要参与者，SP群体迅速壮大。据介绍，在2004年，获得经营许可证的SP企业只有693个，现在，从事增值业务的企业猛增到了近2万家，申请移动增值业务的企业也越来越多。移动增值业务的发展前景广阔。一方面，中国的移动通信用户数已经超过了5亿，而所有这些用户都是移动增值业务的潜在用户；另一方面，移动增值业务的渗透率仅在30%左右，有着巨大的发展空间。北京邮电大学曾剑秋教授表示，随着我国3G的上马，窄带向宽带的升级，传统的语音业务时代将转变成增值业务时代。因此，增值业务的发展离不开3G的支持。我国电信增值业务市场变化速度在加快，行业发展趋于理性。基础电信运营商应与更多的企业进行合作，不断创新运营模式，提高产业链竞争力。	余祖江,曾剑秋	正向	"China Telecom SP management has an industry demonstration effect - reporter Yu Zujiang. The Ministry of Information Industry reported that in the second quarter of this year, there were a total of 1421 user complaints involving SP charges, which decreased by 7.85% compared to the previous quarter, and continued to show a steady downward trend. Among them, the relevant basic telecommunications enterprises are responsible for providing access services and charging SP enterprises, involving China Telecom for 58 cases, which is 29.27% lower than the previous quarter. Among the four major operators, China Telecom SP has the fewest complaints. For the management of SPs, the basic telecommunications enterprises are inescapable. As the value-added services become more prosperous, the importance of the SP market operating in a standardized manner is highlighted. The competition in the future will be between industrial chains, and the provision of information services requires the joint effort to expand the industrial chain. Although the appeal for SP regulation has been effective, the overall number of appeals has decreased significantly, but they are relatively concentrated. The data shows that there were 789 cases involving China Mobile, a decrease of 2.11% from the previous quarter; 516 cases involving China Unicom, a decrease of 13.71% from the previous quarter; and 58 cases involving China Netcom, an increase of 3.57% from the previous quarter. Currently, according to the principle of ""whoever connects is responsible"", it is mainly the basic telecommunications enterprises that are responsible for managing the relevant SPs. There are fewer complaints about SPs involving China Telecom, which to some extent indicates that China Telecom has achieved some success in regulating SPs. In 2007, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology established the ""Three Whos Principle"", that is, ""Whoever is in charge, whoever is responsible"", ""Whoever operates, whoever is responsible"", and ""Whoever connects, whoever is responsible"", aiming to clarify the responsibilities of each link, eliminate responsibility blind spots, and standardize the management of telecommunications information services. For this, China Telecom has established a series of rules and regulations for various cooperative businesses such as the Internet, voice messaging, and SMS for Little Smart, strictly controlling the network access, content review, agency fee management, and business assessment of SPs to ensure that partners provide legal and healthy content. For example, China Telecom has established a credit point management system for SPs that are connected, and included the non-compliant behavior of cooperative SPs in the scope of inter-enterprise cooperation management. The market scale of value-added telecommunications services is still untapped. According to the statistics and estimates of the Telecommunications Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, by the end of December 2006, the total scale of the value-added telecommunications service market in China exceeded 156 billion yuan, and it is expected to exceed 160 billion yuan in 2007. Undoubtedly, the market for value-added services is a ""gold mine"". The market scale of fixed-value-added services is smaller than that of mobile-value-added services. The existing value-added services in our country are ranked by revenue as information services, ISP, IDC, and call centers, and in the revenue of information services, mobile information services account for 75%, internet information services account for 23%, and telephone information services account for 2%. Clearly, mobile networks are more attractive to SPs, but there are reasons why fixed networks attract and retain SPs as well. There is still a lot of room for growth in fixed-value-added services. Including IPTV, fixed-mobile one-number service, broadband, and other value-added services provided by SPs, this is the new value space of the future. Mobile information services are a trend, and the development of mobile value-added services is rapid, becoming the main driving force for the growth of telecommunications operators' business revenue. According to the financial report, the revenue of value-added services of China Mobile in the first half of this year increased by 35.5% year-on-year to 41.915 billion yuan, accounting for 25.5% of the total operating revenue. As an important participant in the value chain of mobile value-added services, the SP group has grown rapidly. It is reported that in 2004, there were only 693 SP enterprises with operating licenses, and now the number of enterprises engaged in value-added services has surged to nearly 20,000, and more and more enterprises are applying for mobile value-added services. The development prospects of mobile value-added services are broad. On the one hand, the number of mobile communication users in China has exceeded 500 million, and all these users are potential users of mobile value-added services; on the other hand, the penetration rate of mobile value-added services is only around 30%, with huge development potential. Professor Zeng Jianqiu of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications said that with the launch of China's 3G, the upgrade from narrowband to broadband, the traditional voice service era will be transformed into a value-added service era. Therefore, the development of value-added services cannot do without the support of 3G. The pace of change in China’s telecommunications value-added services market is accelerating, and industry development is becoming more rational. Basic telecom operators should cooperate with more enterprises, constantly innovate their operating models, and enhance the competitiveness of the industrial chain."

考研网站出现假文凭广告引网友热议-新快报记者邓毅富《研究生招生网与作弊答案和假学历同行》，10月31日，猫扑网站一个名为“今天你干了CLY”的网友加了这样一个帖子。“今天你干了CLY”说的网站，是指“中国研究生招生信息网”，据截图显示，网站网页点开帖子以后，在右边一栏中，出现谷歌网站的随机广告，广告的内容是贩卖假文凭和考试答案。此事引起了网友们的热议，有人认为，这跟网站无关，因为是谷歌广告附带随机生成的；也有人认为，网站有拒绝不恰当广告的责任。考研网站出现“一条龙服务”引网友热议页面内容很“雷”人“今天闲来无聊，浏览了一下‘中国研究生招生信息网’，在里面看到一些信息，用现在流行的话来说，就是‘很雷’——该网的招生信息和作弊答案、假学历广告竟出现在同一页面上”。10月31日，网友“今天你干了CLY”在猫扑网上加了这样一个帖子，并提供了截图。截图的页面显示：在打开一条《研究生网报31日结束11月10日至14日现场确认》的帖子之后，页面右边有一栏广告。这个广告称：“速取本科、研究生(真实学历)”，并附带了联系电话；另一条广告称：“研究生考试答案QQ×××××××××”，该广告还细分为“09考研过关”和“考研过关”两项，并都附带上QQ号码。记者找到了“中国研究生招生信息网”，按图索骥,发现情况果然如网友“今天你干了CLY”所说。“中国研究生招生信息网”的主管单位是“教育部高校学生司”、主办单位是“全国高等学校学生信息咨询与就业指导中心”、承办单位是“学信咨询服务有限公司”。从网站内容看，它内容丰富，除了教育部和各地的招生考试信息外，还有网上报名考研的功能，人气相当热。而网友“今天你干了CLY”披露的考试作弊广告就出现在与“考研动态”的各篇文章的同一网页的右边栏广告位置上，并有“Google提供的广告”等字样。网站广告谁负责任？对于作弊广告究竟是不是“中国研究生招生信息网”的责任，网友们展开了热议。网友“半导体”认为：“页面旁边是谷歌的广告栏，这事要找谷歌，广告投放内容是由谷歌决定的。谷歌的广告是根据网站的内容自动匹配相关的广告的。”而一位自称是做网络广告的网友“理更深的蓝”则指出：“这是谷歌的网络广告，网站是有权利是否投放广告产生盈利，但没有权利屏蔽内容。只要广告主肯付钱。出现这样的情况首先一点是谷歌没有做好内容屏蔽；二是网站为了盈利投放广告。双方都负有责任。”网友“山夫”则认为这个广告只是“骗钱”：“说白了骗傻瓜和求捷径人的钱，钱汇出去了，就没有回音。”网友“红风车”则称：“一切皆有可能嘛，中国是块神奇的土壤。”网友“路过红尘”说：“我老婆在东北某知名大学读研，惊奇地发现自己是寝室唯一一个不买答案考上的……”网友“laijiaxing2002”则调侃说：“谷歌的广告是很公正的，这则广告绝对是与该网页内容相关程度最高的产品，很真实，很好地反映了社会的和谐、自然的和谐、万物相生相克。”网友“路了卿”则爆料：“中国社会资源和保障部，就是国家公务员考试网上还有卖答案的，真令人崩溃了……”网友“良民良言”由此表达了自己对考研的不信任：“我已经发狂了，现在我看到称自己是研究生的人我也不把当他研究生了。”但网友“茶煲”则认为这只是极个别的现象：“一般说来，重点院校的研究生录取还是很公平的，即使是本校的学生考取本校的研究生也是十分辛苦的。”而大部分网友也表示了深深的忧虑:“这样子只会给想不劳而获的人提供了捷径，而一个号称正规教育的官方网站，竟然对这样的广告不管不问，以后谁会相信文凭跟学历的纯洁？”	邓毅富,今天你干了CLY,CLY,理更深的蓝,山夫,红风车,路了卿,良民良言,茶煲	负向	"Fake diploma ads on postgraduate admission websites spark online debate - Deng Yifu, Xingkai Daily reporter, ""Postgraduate Admission Website and Cheat Answers and Fake Diplomas Travel Together"", On October 31, a netizen named ""Today You Did CLY"" on Mopu website posted such a post.

And the cheating advertisement posted by the netizen ""Today You Did CLY"" appeared in the right sidebar ad position of the same web page as the ""Postgraduate Entrance Examination News"" articles, with the words ""Ad provided by Google"". Who is responsible for the website advertisement? For the responsibility of the cheating advertisement, whether it is the responsibility of ""China Graduate Admissions Information Network"", netizens have been discussing heatedly. Netizen ""semiconductor"" believes that: there is Google's ad bar next to the page, and this should be found with Google, and the content of the ad placement is decided by Google. Google’s ads are automatically matched to relevant ads based on the content of the website. And a netizen who calls himself ""Li Shenge's Blue"" who claims to be in the field of online advertising pointed out that ""This is a Google online advertisement. The website has the right to make a profit by placing advertisements, but it has no right to block content."" As long as the advertiser is willing to pay. First, Google did not do a good job of content blocking; second, the website placed advertisements to make a profit. Both sides are at fault. Netizen Shanfu believes that the advertisement is just a scam to ""make money"": ""In the end, the money is sent out and there is no reply, it is just to fool the foolish and those who seek a shortcut. Netizen ""Hong Fengche"" said, ""Anything is possible, China is a miraculous soil."" Netizen ""Passing by Red Dust"" said: ""My wife is studying in a famous university in Northeast China, and she was surprised to find out that she was the only one in the dormitory who passed the exam without buying the answers... ""Netizen ""laijiaxing2002"" then joked: ""Google's ads are very fair, this ad is the product with the highest relevance to the content of this webpage, very realistic, and well reflects the harmony of society, the harmony of nature, and the interdependence and mutual restraint of all things. Then, the netizen Lu Liqing revealed that the Ministry of Social Resources and Security of China, which is responsible for the civil service examination online, was selling answers, which was really disheartening. The netizen, ""Lianmin Lianyan"", expressed his distrust in the postgraduate entrance examination: I have gone crazy, and now I no longer regard those who call themselves postgraduates as postgraduates. But the netizen ""Teapot"" believes that this is just an individual phenomenon: ""Generally speaking, the admission of postgraduates to key universities is still very fair, and even for students of the same university to take postgraduate courses is very hard work."" And most netizens also expressed deep concern: ""This will only provide a shortcut for those who want to get something for nothing, and a so-called official website of formal education actually turns a blind eye to such advertisements. Who will believe in the purity of diplomas and academic qualifications in the future?"" """
富士康大量招临时工疑为内迁作准备作者/陈小瑛身陷涨薪和内迁疑云的富士康又有新状况。《华夏时报》记者近日在富士康观澜厂区采访发现，数千名从外地学校来的暑期工蜂拥而来，参加培训。为此，富士康还出面高价包下了厂区周边的民宅，用作临时员工宿舍。记者调查后得知，此次批量来富士康接受培训的大学生暑期工，身份上显然和之前从社会上吸纳的人有明显区别；另外，暑期工全部都来自河南。要知道，最近一段时间，关于富士康内迁目的地的传闻最盛的就是河南。富士康是不是在为内迁作准备？在郭台铭出面动员内迁传闻之际，来自富士康的关于内迁的声音少之又少，其迁移方向更是讳莫如深。对此，本报记者多方采访了解到，富士康在这样的时间点的种种做法，很可能是故意在吊胃口，以便造成内地争抢的局面。为内迁作准备？7月5日，富士康观澜厂区北门，一个叫润园小区的农民房小区大楼门口贴出了催促客户搬迁的通知，“因特殊原因，住户必须在7月15日之前搬走。”富士康员工王小庆告诉记者，他住在厂区北门的润园小区共四栋楼，最近富士康来了很多暑期工没地方住，富士康便高价把小区全包下来了。房租暴涨就是缘于富士康突然大量招聘的数千名暑期工，但对数千突如其来的暑期工，富士康并未做足准备。“刚来的很多没法安排住宿，有的就在富士康大门口打地铺睡了4天。”王小庆对记者说。本报记者在富士康观澜厂区了解到，此次前来实习的暑期工全部来自河南，在实习两个月或者三个月后，考察合格并愿意留在富士康的工人将被派往各处工厂。富士康所招实习生也同样享受与工人同等工资待遇，即底薪1200元，加班工资另算。“富士康在郑州大街小巷都贴满了招聘公告，但我看到公告上写的工作地点没有在郑州的，而是淮安、烟台等地。”河南郑州当地人士告诉记者，郑州厂区现在还没开建。在富士康观澜厂区生产苹果电脑的小卢宿舍搬来好几个实习生，都是来自河南，其中，一个学校一起就来了一千多人，所签合同也都是短期的，他们培训两个月后没毕业的将先回学校，毕业的具体去向连他们自己也不知道。记者在富士康观澜厂区南门看到还有前来找工作的人，但富士康缺人，只统一从学校招聘，不对社会公开招聘，这点颇让人看不懂。“这是集团统一策略，根据自身发展需求做出的决定，具体原因我们也不知道，但针对某个特定人群招聘并没有问题。”富士康人力资源部人士对《华夏时报》记者如是说。“最近苹果的三个产品都进入量产，需要大量员工。”观澜区A1栋某员工告诉记者，可能只是因为订单突然增多，暂时缺人，所以招聘暑期工。富士康龙华CNSBG事业群某线长对本报记者否认是为内迁作准备：“如果只是培训，完全可以直接去内地已建好的厂培训，没必要花更大成本专门跑深圳来，流水线工作培训是件很简单的事，一看就会，一般一个星期就可以上岗操作。”富士康打什么算盘？疑云密布，富士康到底在想什么？“搞不懂富士康要干吗，观澜厂区A区苹果电脑生产线马上将搬往龙华厂区，最近晚上经常在运走机器，现在又要不断招人来，走一批，换一批。”富士康观澜厂区某办公室行政人员对记者说。“先安心工作，到搬的时候就搬。”龙华厂区G区某栋办公室员工告诉记者，因为之前他们对外传递了搬迁的去向，公司高层在内部发文彻查谁泄露了机密，表示要严惩，现在有什么动向，富士康也不再向员工透露。而公司第二波加薪潮考核日期从6月6日算起，考核三个月合格者，将底薪提高至2000元，但现在已经过去一个月，具体考核标准尚未出台，员工们对二次涨薪持怀疑态度，可能符合要求的没几个。富士康工会联合会人士告诉记者，目前正在制定详细考核标准，“富士康公布过会涨薪，就肯定会对合格的人兑现，不是信口开河。”富士康一边应付涨薪，一边忙招人来深圳，一边还要忙搬离深圳，种种动作着实看不懂。深圳大学产经研究中心主任魏达志对记者直言，“富士康现在就像一个小商贩在吆喝顾客，我要搬迁，你们快来抢吧。”这样形成一种热销的竞争效应，也让富士康有更多选择的筹码。魏达志认为，在工业化竞争中，沿海和内地发展阶段不同，深圳不需要富士康，内地有的城市如人口大省河南还是欢迎富士康这样能解决大量劳动力的企业。“但富士康的选择，主要是出于自身成本考虑，如果如外界所说，在河南给出的工资跟深圳一样，那富士康完全没有必要搬迁，媒体一窝蜂地宣传，刚好中了富士康下怀，这从河南先后传递出不同的虚假信息就知道。这是一个常识问题，很多人却想不清楚。”魏达志对记者说。	陈小瑛,郭台铭,王小庆,小卢,魏达志	正向	"Foxconn is recruiting a large number of temporary workers, which may be for the preparation of internal migration. Author: Chen Xiaoying Foxconn, which is caught in the wage increase and internal migration rumors, has a new situation. Recently, reporters from Huaxia Times found that thousands of summer workers from schools in other places flocked to the Fanuigang factory area for training. For this, Foxconn also stepped in to buy up residential houses around the factory area at a high price, to be used as temporary employee dormitories. After the journalists investigated, it was found that the college students who came to Foxconn for training in this batch were obviously different from those who were absorbed from society before; in addition, all the summer workers came from Henan. It is said that in recent days, the rumor about the relocation destination of Foxconn is most prevalent in Henan. Is Foxconn making preparations for relocation? While there were rumors of Hon Hai’s relocation, there were few voices from Hon Hai itself, and the direction of its relocation was shrouded in secrecy. According to the interviews conducted by the reporter from all sides, Foxconn's various actions at this time point may be deliberately teasing in order to create a situation of competition among the mainland. Prepare for relocation? On July 5, a notice urging customers to move out was posted at the entrance of the residential building of the Fenghuan New Village, a farmer's housing area at the north gate of Fenghuan Factory, Foxconn, requesting that the residents must move out by July 15 for a special reason. Wang Xiaoqing, a Foxconn employee, told the reporter that the Run Yuan residential area, which has four buildings, is located at the north gate of the factory zone. Recently, Foxconn has brought in a lot of summer workers without accommodation, so Foxconn has taken over the entire residential area at a high price. The rent increase was due to the sudden recruitment of thousands of summer workers by Foxconn, but Foxconn was not adequately prepared for the thousands of sudden summer workers. Many of those who just arrived could not be accommodated, and some slept on the ground at the entrance of Foxconn for four days. Wang Xiaoqing told the reporter. The reporter learned from the Foxconn Guanlan factory that all the summer workers who came for internship this time were from Henan Province. After two or three months of internship, the workers who passed the inspection and were willing to stay at Foxconn would be sent to various factories. The interns recruited by Foxconn enjoy the same salary待遇 as the workers, that is, a basic salary of 1200 yuan, with overtime pay calculated separately. Foxconn had posted recruitment notices all over the streets of Zhengzhou, but the locations listed on the notices were not in Zhengzhou, but in places like Huai'an and Yantai. Local people in Henan Zhengzhou told reporters that the Zhengzhou factory has not yet started construction. In the Fenghuanggang factory of Foxconn, Xiao Lu’s dormitory, which produces Apple computers, has moved in several interns, all from Henan Province. Among them, more than a thousand people from the same school came, and all the contracts were short-term. After two months of training, those who did not graduate will return to school first, and they themselves do not know the specific destination of their graduation. Journalists saw people coming to look for jobs at the south gate of the Foxconn Guanlan factory, but Foxconn was short of workers and only recruited uniformly from schools, not recruiting from society, which was a bit hard to understand. This is a unified strategy of the group, a decision made according to the needs of its own development. We don't know the specific reasons, but recruiting a specific group of people is not a problem. A person from the human resources department of Foxconn told the journalists of the China Economic Times so. Recently, three of Apple's products have entered mass production and need a large number of employees. An employee in A1 building of Guanlan District told the reporter that it might just be because of a sudden increase in orders and a temporary shortage of staff, so they are recruiting summer workers. To the reporter, the line leader of a certain line of the CNSBG business group of Foxconn Longhua denied that it was preparing for internal relocation: ""If it is just training, it can be directly trained in the factory that has already been built in the mainland. There is no need to spend more cost to run to Shenzhen specially. Training for line work is a very simple thing, you can learn it by looking, and you can start working in a week."" What is Foxconn's calculation? The clouds are gathering, what is Foxconn thinking? I don't understand what Foxconn is up to. The Apple computer production line in Area A of Guanlan factory will soon move to Longhua factory. Recently, machines are often transported at night. Now they are recruiting people continuously, and a batch leaves and a batch comes. An administrative staff member of an office in the观澜 factory of Foxconn told the reporter. First, work with peace of mind, and move when it's time to move. The employees in an office building in G District of Longhua Factory told reporters that because they had previously disclosed the direction of the relocation to the outside, the company's top management issued an internal document to thoroughly investigate who had leaked the confidential information, and stated that they would punish the person severely. Now, Foxconn no longer informs the employees of any developments. The second round of salary increases for the company will be based on a three-month assessment starting from June 6. Those who pass the assessment will have their base salary increased to 2000 yuan. However, since a month has already passed, the specific assessment criteria have not yet been issued, and employees are skeptical about the second round of salary increases, as it is likely that only a few will meet the requirements. According to the union official of Foxconn, the detailed assessment criteria are currently being formulated, ""Foxconn has announced that the salary will increase, so it will definitely honor the qualified people, not just talk."" Foxconn is busy recruiting people to Shenzhen while dealing with wage hikes and moving out of Shenzhen, and all these actions are hard to understand. Wei Dazhi, director of the Industrial Economics Research Center at Shenzhen University, told the press frankly, ""Foxconn is now like a small vendor shouting at customers, I am moving, come and grab it quickly."" This creates a competitive effect that drives sales, and gives Foxconn more leverage in its choices. Wei Yatze believes that in industrial competition, the development stages of coastal and inland areas are different, and Shenzhen does not need Foxconn, while some cities in inland areas, such as Henan, a province with a large population, still welcome Foxconn, a company that can solve a large number of labor. But Foxconn’s choice was mainly for its own cost considerations. If, as the outside world says, the wages in Henan are the same as those in Shenzhen, Foxconn has no need to move. The media’s one-sided promotion just fell into Foxconn’s trap, as can be seen from the different false information that Henan has successively conveyed. It is a common sense question, but many people can't figure it out. Wei Dazhi told the reporter."
王挺《断箭》转型“八指老大”不惧《上海滩》新浪娱乐讯由海润影视出品的年代黑帮大戏《断箭》已于昨日在北京影视频道黄金档与观众见面，本剧由于融合了兄弟情、儿女情与家国情，再加上火爆的动作场面，使得一开播便广受关注。硬汉王挺在剧中饰演一个放荡不羁的上海滩黑帮老大“达文秀’，下足功夫的他不怕观众拿他跟荧屏经典《上海滩》中的角色比较。王挺演艺十年历程，《断箭》是转折从初为人知的《重案六组》丁箭，到激情燃烧的《战士》郑虎臣、再到广受好评的《兴国兴国》谢勋东，这些硬汉角色见证了王挺的成长。在这十余年间，他从一个演技稍显稚嫩的小伙子，逐渐成长为《断箭》中收放自如的黑帮老大达文秀，观众的认可背后，他付出了无数的努力和伤痛。在拍完《断箭》之后，王挺感慨说这是自己拍的最累的一部戏，因为剧中打斗、爆破的戏份太多。却也是自己人生中的一个转折点，因为这是他首次改变形象，扮演一个放荡不羁的黑帮老大，“当时所有的精力都放在了这个角色上，哪怕休息的时候我们都在讨论剧本，很少有闲聊的时候。”下足了功夫的王挺对这部戏充满信心，也希望能受到观众们的欢迎，看到他不同以往的一面。“八指老大”王挺不惧与“丁力”比拼提起上海滩的黑帮老大，最先想到的还是《上海滩》中的“丁力”，他桀骜不驯，亦正亦邪，是荧屏上的经典形象。而王挺此次在《断箭》中饰演的亦是一个黑帮老大，达文秀放荡不羁、带些痞气却为人仗义，凭借过人的胆量和出色的身手成长为上海滩第一帮派“龙帮”的灵魂人物。他从小混迹在动荡的旧上海滩，深知百姓疾苦，因此在看到日本人的残暴屠杀后，忍辱负重，“潜伏”进日本人的阵营中，暗地里却推动了上海滩抗日的浪潮，最后不幸被日本人剁掉了两根手指，成为了“八指老大”。与丁力相比，达文秀少了一丝精明，多了一份宽厚大度，他忧国忧民，不为外界诱惑所打动，甘愿默默承受所有人的误解，这种独特的人格魅力也吸引了众多美女的好感，名伶陆小青(陈德容(微博))，青梅竹马的龙美君(张定涵)都为他倾倒。相信达文秀这个八指老大，在经典面前也丝毫不会逊色。	王挺,达文秀,丁箭,郑虎臣,谢勋东,丁力,陆小青,陈德容,龙美君,张定涵	正向	"Wang Ting's ""Dian Jian"" has transformed into ""Eight Fingers Boss"" and is not afraid of ""Shanghai Beach"". Sina Entertainment News. Dian Jian, a drama produced by Hai Run TV, was broadcast in the prime time of Beijing TV yesterday. The drama, which integrates brotherhood, family and country, as well as exciting action scenes, has attracted a lot of attention since its broadcast. Hard man Wang Ting plays a dissolute Shanghai gang boss ""Dawenxiu"" in the drama, and he is not afraid of being compared by the audience with the classic role in ""Shanghainese"" on the screen. Wang Ting's ten years of acting journey, ""Arrow Broken"" is a turning point, from the initial recognition of ""Major Case Team 6"" Ding Jian, to the passionate and burning ""Warrior"" Zheng Hushen, and then to the widely praised ""Prosperous State"" Xie Xundong, these tough guy roles witnessed Wang Ting's growth. In these more than ten years, he has gradually grown from a slightly immature young man to the boss of the gang in ""The Broken Arrow"", who can control the situation at will. Behind the recognition of the audience, he has made countless efforts and suffered. After finishing the Arrow, Wang Ting said that it was the most exhausting play he had ever made, because there were too many fight and explosion scenes in the drama. It was also a turning point in his life, because it was the first time he changed his image and played a wild and unruly gang boss. At that time, all his energy was focused on the role, and even when we were resting, we were discussing the script, and there was almost no time for idle chatter. Wang Ting, who put a lot of effort into this play, is full of confidence in it and hopes to win the audience's favor and see a different side of him. Wang Ting, the ""Eight Fingers Boss"", is not afraid to compete with ""Ding Li"" in提起上海滩的黑帮老大, the first thing that comes to mind is still Ding Li in the TV series Shanghai Beach. He is unruly, and can be both righteous and evil, a classic screen image. And Wang Ting, in this play ""The Broken Arrow"", plays a gang boss, Daxiu, who is unrestrained, a bit of a rascal, but righteous. He has grown into the soul of the first gang in Shanghai, ""Dragon Gang"", relying on his courage and excellent skills. He grew up in the turbulent old Shanghai and knew the hardships of the people, so after seeing the brutal slaughter by the Japanese, he endured humiliation and entered the Japanese camp, secretly promoting the anti-Japanese tide in Shanghai. Unfortunately, he was later chopped off two fingers by the Japanese and became the ""Eight-finger Boss"". Compared with Ding Li, Daxiu is less shrewd and more generous. He is concerned about the country and the people, and is not tempted by external temptations. He is willing to bear all misunderstandings silently. This unique personality also attracts the affection of many beautiful women. The famous singer Lu Xiaoying (Chen Derong), and the childhood sweethearts Long Meijun (Zhang Dinghan) are all captivated by him. I believe that Daxiong, this eight-fingered big boss, will not be inferior in front of classics."

On the afternoon of October 15, 2011, the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship in Tokyo, Japan, ended the men's rings final, Chinese athlete Chen Yibing (blog) with 15.800 points to win the men's rings champion, this is his fourth time to win the World Championship men's rings champion. Narbette from Brazil won the silver medal with 15.600 points, and Yamashita Kōshi from Japan won the bronze medal with 15.500 points. Kohei Uchimura went first, and his difficulty was not high. He should have been able to complete it normally, but it seems that his physical exhaustion was enormous. He failed to complete the last horizontal cross, nearly falling off the apparatus, and finally he got 14.633 points. Chen Yibing was the second to perform, and he started with a right-angle cross, a horizontal cross, and an inverted cross, all three crosses were perfectly in place! The cross, the inverted cross, and the horizontal cross after the back swing, all fully displayed the power, Chen Yibing, the king of rings, gave a textbook perfect performance, and finally, the 720 spin down without a trace, 15.800, the E score was 9.000! The third to appear was Brazilian Nabaleti Zane, who ranked just behind Chen Yibing in the preliminary round. He used his strength impressively, and his crosses were all very standard, with no problem with the static time. However, he did not do the split horizontal support well, and he scored 15.600 points. The next American athlete to appear, Horton, is clearly not in the medal-winning category, and his poor form this year has continued into this competition. He failed to complete even the less difficult moves, and he scored 14.300 points. The Dutch veteran Van格尔德, who returned after being released, was the fifth to appear. His difficulty was also very high. He did a very good job with the several very physically demanding crosses at the beginning of the performance, but he became less natural as the performance went on. It was a bit difficult to get to the horizontal in the back swing, and he sat on the ground with a front double back. He got 14.666 points. Veteran Mollandi from Italy followed, who, like Van格尔德, had excellent crosses with a sense of power in the first half, but could not keep up with the latter half of the strength, and finally failed to stop before the landing, although he stood straight and vertical, he only got 15.200 points. Calmón from Venezuela was not difficult, but his completion was not so good, and he fell forward on the ground, getting 14.266 points. Koichi Yamamuro was the last to perform, and his performance was still not bad. The horizontal cross, right-angle cross, and inverted cross were also in place. The static time of the horizontal cross after a front double back was also sufficient. He took a small step back in a vertical spin down. The difficulty score of this set was slightly lower than Chen Yibing's. He got 15.500 points, and Chen Yibing won the gold medal without any悬念! Powerful

Hunan Red Network, April 1 (Reporter Liu Can) - After the video of the deputy county magistrate of Fuyu County, Jilin Province, losing his temper and slamming the door was exposed, it continued to cause heated discussion among netizens. The deputy county magistrate Gao Yong, who was described as ""slam door king"" and ""the most undisturbed deputy county magistrate"" by netizens, was given the titles of ""slam door king"" and ""the most undisturbed deputy county magistrate"" because of his ""outburst, profanity, slamming the door, and doing whatever he wants"". Netizens also showed great concern about whether the relevant officials had been punished according to law and discipline. On April 1, the reporters from Hongwang Network made a telephone connection with several units in the Jilin Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Soft Environment Office, and so on. It is reported that Songyuan City has initiated an investigation into Vice County Governor Gao Yong and others involved in the case, and the formal handling results will be announced as soon as possible. Jilin Province's Soft Environment Office: 8 people have been investigated. Jilin Province's Soft Environment Office confirmed that during the period when Jilin Dekka Company invested in Fuyu County, the county government did not keep its word, the efficiency of handling affairs was low, which affected the construction of the company's projects and caused significant losses. The provincial soft environment office has instructed the Discipline Inspection Commission of Songyuan City to investigate. The city of Songyuan launched an investigation into Vice County Governor Gao Yong and eight others involved in the case, and imposed severe warnings within the party, administrative reprimands, and dismissals from office. Meanwhile, the staff of the Development Environment Complaint Center of the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Songyuan City confirmed that the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Songyuan City had indeed launched an investigation into Gao Yong and others according to the requirements of the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Jilin Province and the Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province, and had already reported the proposed handling results to the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Jilin Province and the Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province. As to which eight people have been investigated and what kind of punishment they will receive, the staff member said that it is confidential before the CCDI's investigation is announced, and the results will be announced as soon as they are officially released. "". He also said that the Siping Discipline Inspection Commission has intervened and made multiple efforts to mediate the land dispute between Deca Group and Fuyu County Government, and that Fuyu County Government is still in talks with Deca Group. Xu Jie, the county party secretary of Fuyu, who was exposed by Jilin TV in November 2010 and was called ""irresponsible"" by netizens, was elected as the deputy secretary of the standing committee of the people's congress of Songyuan on January 14, 2011. Also, a piece of information on the Fusong County government website shows that Xu Jie is currently the vice chairman of the Songyuan Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee and the secretary of Fusong County Party Committee. In the information on the Fusuyi County Government website on March 22, 2018, which was titled ""Our County Convened a New Rural Construction Work Conference,"" Liu Shuling, the Party Secretary of Fusuyi County and Director of the County Party Office, who was ""drunk,"" still held the original position to host the ""New Rural Construction Work Conference."" As for the vice-county magistrate Gao Yong, who had a temper tantrum, swore, and slammed the door, the government website still lists him as a county leader, with the responsibility of “assisting the county magistrate in charge of the Transportation Bureau, Construction Bureau, Urban Construction Development and Management Office, Urban Comprehensive Law Enforcement Office, Family Planning and Population and Family Planning Bureau, Radio and Television Administration Bureau, and Radio and Television Network Company.” Subsequently, in order to learn about the progress of the handling of the land dispute between Deca Group and Fuyu County Government, the reporter dialed Fuyu County ""County Magistrate's Open Telephone (0438-5862345)"" to try to contact the relevant person in charge, but no one answered the phone. [Further news] The results of the handling of Gao Yong, vice-county magistrate of Fuyu County, and others were announced. Four people were dismissed from their posts. Rednet, April 1 (Reporter Liu Can). At 7:35 p.m. on April 1, Rednet reporters made a follow-up call to the Discipline Inspection Commission and the Provincial Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province. A leader of the Jilin provincial discipline inspection committee confirmed to the media that after the investigation of the administrative inaction of the vice-county magistrate of Fuyu county and others, the Standing Committee of the Siping Discipline Inspection Committee decided to give the vice-county magistrate of Fuyu county, Gao Yong, a serious warning within the party and a demerit; to give the director of the county construction bureau, Liu Changwen, a revocation of his position within the party and a demotion; to give the director of the county health bureau, Li Chunhui, a revocation of his position within the party and a demotion; to give the director of the county land bureau, Ju Dianyin, a major demerit; to give the former secretary of the county committee of the CPC and the current director of the new area of the agricultural high-tech development zone of Siping city, Zhou Guangxin, a warning within the party; to give the director of the planning department of the county construction bureau, Zhou Zhongyou, a demotion; and to give the director of the land conservation department of the county land bureau, Wang Baowen, a demotion. He also revealed that on the video conference of the work of rectifying and building the soft environment for economic development in Jilin Province on March 30, the case had been reported to the whole province, and today it was officially released to the media. He said, ""The Jilin provincial disciplinary committee and the netizens share the same feeling, hoping for severe punishment of such behavior."" Discipline inspection and supervision will further increase the intensity of investigating and punishing. For the netizens’ follow-up questions about Liu Shusheng, the Party Secretary of Fuyu County Committee and Director of the Office of the Fuyu County Committee drinking during working hours, the official said that Fuyu County had already taken corresponding measures."

奥巴马同父异母弟弟涉嫌持有大麻被捕中新网1月31日电美国媒体报导，肯尼亚警方今天表示，美国总统奥巴马(BarackObama)的同父异母弟弟乔治•奥巴马(GeorgeObama)，遭肯尼亚警方逮捕，罪名是持有大麻。“中央社”引述CNN消息称，巡官穆特姆贝是负责本案的警官。穆特姆贝说，乔治因涉嫌持有大麻被捕，且当时曾拒捕，预定2月2日出庭。报导指出，乔治目前被拘押在肯尼亚首都奈洛比(Nairobi)的胡鲁马(Huruma)警局。CNN记者前往牢房与他交谈，乔治否认这类指控。他说：“他们把我从家里带走。我不知道他们为何要起诉我。”虽然乔治与奥巴马曾见过面，但彼此几乎不认识对方。在奥巴马的近亲当中，只有极少数未参加上周在华盛顿举行的总统就职典礼，乔治就是其中之一。报导指出，奥巴马在回忆录“奥巴马的梦想之路——以父之名”(DreamsfromMyFather)中描述说，认识乔治是件“痛苦的事”。奥巴马的肯尼亚之行，是为了会晤从未谋面的亲人。报导说，乔治与奥巴马两人同父异母。奥巴马在回忆录写道，他力求修补与父亲的关系。奥巴马的父亲在他童年时期就离开他与母亲。奥巴马的父亲在车祸中丧生，当年乔治才6个月大。乔治和奥巴马一样，对父亲几乎一无所知。	奥巴马,BarackObama,乔治,乔治•奥巴马,穆特姆贝	正向	"Obama's half-brother was arrested for possessing marijuana. China News Network, January 31, 2018. According to American media reports, Kenyan police said that Obama's half-brother, George Obama, was arrested by Kenyan police for possessing marijuana. According to the CNN report cited by the Central News Agency, Constable Mutumba is the police officer in charge of the case. Mutambe said that George was arrested for allegedly possessing marijuana, and had resisted arrest, and was due to appear in court on February 2. The report noted that George is currently detained at the Huruma police station in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. CNN reporters went to the cell to talk to him, and George denied such accusations. He said, ""They took me away from my home."" I don't know why they are suing me. Although George met Obama, he hardly knew the other. Among Obama's close relatives, only a few did not attend the inauguration of the president held in Washington last week, and George was one of them. The report noted that in his memoir, Dreams from My Father – In the Name of My Father, Obama described meeting George as a ""painful thing."" Obama's visit to Kenya was to meet his distant relatives whom he had never met. Reports say that George and Obama are half-brothers. In his memoir, Obama wrote that he sought to mend his relationship with his father. Obama's father left him and his mother during his childhood. Obama's father died in a car accident when George was only six months old. George knows almost nothing about his father, just as Obama does."
美的精英赛斯科特65杆领先高杰刘俊峰落后两杆新浪体育讯　北京时间10月15日，澳大利亚大炮克雷格-斯科特(CraigScott)第一天打顺德君兰国际高尔夫俱乐部，便打出65杆，低于标准杆6杆，取得了美的中国精英赛首轮领先。中国选手高杰与刘俊峰表现也不错，分别打出67杆，低于标准杆4杆，位于并列第四位。克雷格-斯科特由于护照出了问题，直到星期三下午5点才来到顺德。他开了一个球车在球场上转了一圈，就相当于练习了。星期四在完全盲打的情况下，澳大利亚人抓到5只小鸟，射下1头老鹰，虽然在第五洞四杆洞吞下了柏忌，最终就力压爱尔兰选手艾迪-巴尔(EddieBarr)和澳大利亚选手布拉德-麦克因托什(BradMcIntosh)取得了领先。后边这两位选手在第一轮交出66杆，低于标准杆5杆。2003年美国公开赛亚军斯特芬-林尼(StephenLeaney)今天的开局和收尾很不错，前三个洞打出低于标准杆4杆，而最后两个洞连抓两只小鸟结束。可是他中间出现了一个双柏忌和一个柏忌，最终交出67杆，与中国选手高杰、刘俊峰、韩国选手成始雨(SeaWooSung)一起位于并列第四位。“或许不看球场还好一些。”在加拿大巡回赛上征战四年的克雷格-斯科特半开玩笑地说，“你不看球场，不知道危险在哪里。”其实克雷格-斯科特在君兰打得好的真正原因是他的长杆发挥不错。在澳大利亚巡回赛上，他是发球距离排名前三位的球手。星期四，球场虽然不怎么滚动，他的发球距离也有290到295码。当然这些球能停在球道上也是关键。克雷格-斯科特今天只有一次发球没有上球道。另外，他还有一个颇有运气的球。在第15洞三杆洞，他开球开到果岭后方，距离旗杆大约有10码。他一切进洞便抓到了小鸟。开球距离长在君兰国际高尔夫俱乐部总是会有优势的。克雷格-斯科特的同胞布拉德-麦克因托什一早打出66杆之后也表达了相似的意思。该选手今天抓到9只小鸟，但是也吞下了4个柏忌。曾经在澳大利亚赢得两场比赛的布拉德-麦克因托什说：“这一轮蛮起伏的，有许多小鸟，也有许多柏忌，但不是发球过猛的原因。柏忌主要是因为短杆不好，出现了一些三推。”开球的强项也让刘俊峰处于前列。作为中巡赛唯一一个拿下双鹰的选手，刘俊峰今天抓到了6只小鸟，吞下2个柏忌。河南洛阳选手高杰也是这种观点，他甚至觉得这个球场比较短。29岁选手今年在珠海金湾的职业考试中刚刚获得职业资格，他说：“这个成绩很好，可我还有几个小鸟没有拿下，要不然会更好。”张连伟71杆，平标准杆，吴阿顺70杆，低于标准杆1杆，而梁文冲打出69杆，低于标准杆2杆。“今天我的铁杆小左曲，而木杆又是小右曲。这让我无法靠近旗杆，这是我小鸟球机会不太多的原因。”梁文冲说，“另外，练习果岭与实际的果岭速度不一样，所以在短推的力道上也没有掌握好。可是总体来说，我现在的状态不错。”梁文冲刚刚从日巡赛归来。他在亚巡赛和日巡赛联合举办的亚太公开赛上获得了亚军，而上一周的佳能公开赛，要不是第一轮打出74杆的话，他完全能获得一个前十名。那场因为恶劣天气而削减为三轮的比赛，他最终获得了并列第17名。点击浏览详细成绩>>(小风)	高杰,刘俊峰,克雷格-斯科特,CraigScott,柏忌,艾迪-巴尔,布拉德-麦克因托什,斯特芬-林尼,StephenLeaney,成始雨,张连伟,吴阿顺,梁文冲,小左,小右,小风	正向	"The Australian long hitter Craig Scott shot a 65 on the first day at the Sunningdale King兰高尔夫俱乐部, and led the美的 China Elite Championship. Guojie and Liujunfeng, Chinese players, also played well, shooting 67 under par 4, tied for fourth place. Craig-Scott did not arrive in Shunde until 5 p.m. on Wednesday due to passport problems. He drove a golf cart around the golf course, which was equivalent to practicing. On Thursday, in a completely blind drive, the Australian caught 5 birds, shot an eagle, although he swallowed a bogey in the fifth four-hole, he ultimately led the Irish player Eddie Barr and the Australian player Brad McIntosh. The next two players shot 66, five under par, in the first round. Stephen Leaney, the 2003 U.S. Open runner-up, had a good start and finish today, shooting four under par in the first three holes and closing with two birdies. But he had a double bogey and a bogey in the middle of his round and finished with a 67, tied for fourth with Chinese players Gao Jie and Liu Junfeng and South Korea’s SeaWoo Sung. Perhaps it would have been better not to see the stadium. Craig Scott, who played on the Canadian Tour for four years, half-jokingly said, ""You don't know where the danger is until you see the course."" Craig-Scott's good performance at Jumeriah was actually due to his good performance with his long irons. He is one of the top three players in driving distance on the Australian巡回赛. On Thursday, although the green was not rolling much, his driving distance was 290 to 295 yards. Of course, it is also crucial that these balls can stop on the fairway. Craig-Scott only had one tee shot that didn't go on the fairway today. Moreover, he also had a lucky ball. On the 15th par-3 hole, he hit his drive to about 10 yards past the green, near the pin. He caught the bird as soon as he entered the hole. Longer driving distance always gives an advantage at Junlan International Golf Club. Craig-Scott's fellow countryman Brad-McIntosh also expressed a similar sentiment after carding a 66 in the early hours. The player made 9 eagles today, but also swallowed 4 bogeys. Brad McInnes, who won two rounds in Australia, said, ""This round was a bit up and down, with many eagles and many bogeys, but it was not because of overdriving the tee."" Bogey mainly occurred because of the poor short game and some three putts. The strength of taking the opening kick also put Liu Junfeng in the forefront. As the only player in the China Tour who has ever made an albatross, Liu Junfeng made 6 birdies and 2 bogeys today. Gao Jie, a player from Luoyang, Henan Province, also holds this view, and he even thinks that the length of the court is shorter. The 29-year-old player, who just obtained his professional qualification in the professional examination in Jinwan, Zhuhai this year, said, ""This score is very good, but I still missed a few birdies, otherwise it would have been even better."" Zhang Liangwei shot 71, par, Wu Aishun shot 70, one under par, and Liang Wenchong shot 69, two under par. Today my iron is a little left and my wood is a little right. This made it difficult for me to get close to the flagstick, which is why I don't have many birdie opportunities. Liang Wenchong said, ""In addition, the speed of the practice green is different from that of the actual green, so the force of the short putts was not well controlled."" But overall, I am in pretty good shape now. Liang Wenchong has just returned from the Japan Tour. He finished as the runner-up in the Asia-Pacific Open, which was co-sanctioned by the Asian and Japan Tours, and he would have finished in the top 10 at the Canon Open last week had he not shot a 74 in the first round. That race, which was shortened to three rounds due to bad weather, he eventually finished in a tie for 17th place. Click to view detailed scores>>(Little Wind)"

(Reporter Nie Li) After the theft was exposed, the boss planned to send the thief to the police station, but unexpectedly, the thief cut his wrist on the street, threatening to commit suicide for mercy. Chen, who runs a business of assembling computers in the Computer City, said that a boy who looked like a student came into the store around 2 pm yesterday, saying that he wanted to assemble a game computer. After talking for more than ten minutes, he left because the price was too high. After he left, I habitually looked at the desktop and found that my phone was missing. Mr. Chen ran out quickly to catch the man, who denied it outright. Mr. Chen had no choice but to call the security guards from the square. After the security guard intervened, a crowd gathered, and someone in the crowd testified that the person was a thief. Salesman Xiao Liu, who deals with consumables, said that the other day, after this person came and left, his mobile phone was lost. As more and more people gathered to watch, six people in succession testified that the person had stolen a mobile phone. In the face of public accusations, the thief admitted to the theft and handed over Mr. Chen's mobile phone. In the chaos, two more stolen cell phones fell out of his pocket. Everyone demanded that the thief be handed over to the police, but they did not expect the thief to take out a small knife and cut his wrist, threatening to commit suicide and begging for mercy from the crowd. It is reported that the police took the thief away after receiving a report.

皇马相中西班牙国脚价值3600万世界杯他比托雷斯管用新浪体育讯　据西班牙马卡电台记者埃斯特拉达披露，皇马对现效力于毕尔巴鄂竞技的西班牙国脚前锋洛伦特非常感兴趣。埃斯特拉达在其专栏中透露：自从穆里尼奥来到皇家马德里之后，他的重点引进目标之一就一直是一名前锋。尽管皇马队内已经拥有像伊瓜因和克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多这样的攻击球员，但穆里尼奥想要的是一名风格不同的射手，他希望皇马高层能引进一名善于在禁区内打破僵局的强力中锋。此前已有媒体猜测皇马对拜仁慕尼黑的马里奥·戈麦斯和尤文图斯的阿毛里感兴趣，但穆里尼奥真正提到名字的人却是效力于毕尔巴鄂竞技的费尔南多·略伦特。略伦特拥有了穆里尼奥要求的一切条件：他头球好，双脚技术出色，跑动意识好，善于牵扯对方中卫的防守。此外，略伦特还拥有丰富的大赛经验，西班牙队夺得南非世界杯冠军，其中也有他的功劳。穆里尼奥希望略伦特尽快加盟，以便彻底完善皇马的球员结构。随着中场赫迪拉的到来以及皇马在边后卫位置上的操作，略伦特很可能是最终使球队完整的意外引进。不过，交易能否达成还必须要看略伦特本人以及毕尔巴鄂竞技方面的立场。略伦特的违约金在3600万欧元左右，很多球队都已经打听过他的情况。(KKGonzalez)	埃斯特拉达,洛伦特,穆里尼奥,伊瓜因,克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多,马里奥·戈麦斯,阿毛里,费尔南多·略伦特,略伦特,赫迪拉,KGonzalez	正向	Real Madrid is interested in Loren特, a Spanish national team forward who is currently playing for Bilbao Athletic, according to Estrada, a reporter from Spanish Marca Radio. Estrella revealed in his column that since Mourinho came to Real Madrid, one of his main acquisition targets has always been a forward. Although Real Madrid already had attackers like Higuain and Cristiano Ronaldo, Mourinho wanted a striker of a different style, and he hoped that the club’s management would bring in a powerful center forward who was good at breaking the deadlock in the penalty area. There had been media speculation that Real Madrid were interested in Mario Gomez of Bayern Munich and Amauri of Juventus, but the name that Mourinho actually mentioned was Fernando Llorente, who plays for Athletic Bilbao. Llorente has all the qualities that Mourinho asked for: he is good at heading, has good ball control with both feet, has good running awareness, and is good at drawing defenders away from the center back. In addition, Lorente also has rich experience in major competitions, and his contribution to the Spanish team winning the World Cup in South Africa is also worth mentioning. Mourinho hopes that略伦特 can join as soon as possible so that Real Madrid can perfect its player structure. With the arrival of H迪拉 at halftime and Real Madrid's operation at the wing-back position, it is likely that略伦特 will be the unexpected acquisition that completes the team. But whether or not the deal will go through still depends on Lozano’s own stance and that of Athletic Bilbao. Llorente's release clause is around 36 million euros, and many teams have already inquired about his situation. (KKGonzalez)
泰国两座政府机关大楼再遭爆炸袭击中新网3月25日电据外电报道，泰国副总理25日称，两座政府机关大楼24日再次遭到爆炸袭击，政府将升级安保措施。他说，“红衫军”可能图谋制造混乱，但是泰国政府完全有掌控局势的能力。泰国警方称，首都曼谷北部郊区的一座省政府办公大楼，与首都西部的一座政府大楼24日分别遭到爆炸袭击。负责安保工作的副总理素贴对记者说：“我们必须要调整(安保)行动以防范攻击。”他说已经命令有关官员提升安保措施。素贴说：“情报显示，他们(红衫军)图谋制造混乱，以显示政府无法控制局势，但是我要向泰国人民保证，政府完全有掌控局势的能力。”这两次爆炸没有造成人员伤亡，只导致一些轻微损失。自3月14日以来，已发生过8次爆炸。大部分爆炸事件为手榴弹袭击，但是警方调查称，这次曼谷北部省政府大楼爆炸，他们认为是TNT爆炸装置引起的。	素贴	正向	Two government buildings in Thailand were hit by another explosion. China News Network, March 25, reported by foreign media that Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister said on the 25th that two government buildings were hit by another explosion on the 24th, and the government will upgrade security measures. He said that the “Red Shirts” might plot to create chaos, but the Thai government had the ability to control the situation. The police in Thailand said that a provincial government office building in the northern suburb of the capital Bangkok and a government building in the west of the capital were separately attacked by explosions on the 24th. Deputy Prime Minister Yuththawong, who is in charge of security, told the press that they must adjust the security operation to prevent attacks. He said he had ordered relevant officials to step up security measures. Suthep said that intelligence indicated that the PAD was planning to create chaos to show that the government could not control the situation, but he assured the Thai people that the government had the ability to control the situation. There were no casualties in the two explosions, only some minor damage. Since March 14, there have been 8 explosions. Most of the explosions were grenade attacks, but the police investigation said that the explosion at the northern provincial government building in Bangkok was caused by a TNT device.
意大利锋线边缘人渴望征服里皮回击批评表示永不放弃新浪体育讯　意大利球星夸利亚雷拉相信他可以征服国家队主帅里皮，为自己在意大利的世界杯阵容中争得一个位置。尽管在为俱乐部出战的33场比赛中打入了11个球，这位那不勒斯射手还是受到了广泛的质疑。意大利国家队将在罗马进行世界杯前的集训，夸利亚雷拉则在一片质疑声中被里皮招入训练营。评论家们认为卡萨诺、米科利和巴洛特利等人比他更应该去南非参加世界杯。但是，夸利亚雷拉确信他可以在意大利的攻击线上赢得自己的一席之地而参加今夏的南非世界杯。“我将会尽最大的努力在赛季结束之前证明给里皮看，”夸利亚雷拉告诉媒体，“里皮知道我的一切，我也会尽自己最大的努力，因为我不想留下任何遗憾。”“我是一个永不放弃的人，”夸利亚雷拉坚定的说。夸利亚雷拉在去年夏天加盟了那不勒斯，那也是他儿时就心仪的球队。本赛季他虽然只收获了11个进球，但他认为那不是失败而是成就。“我打入了那些进球，帮助那不勒斯取得了下赛季的欧战资格。”他补充说，“我不认为11个进球很少。十多年来，一直没有球员在意甲联赛帮助那不勒斯打入这么多球。批评我的人也许应该保持沉默。”(威尔曼)	里皮,夸利亚雷拉,卡萨诺,米科利,巴洛特利,威尔曼	正向	"An Italian striker on the periphery of the national team is eager to conquer Lippi and refute criticism by saying he will never give up. Italian sports news from Sina Sports. Quagliarella, an Italian star, believes he can conquer the national team coach Lippi and win a position in the Italian World Cup team. Despite scoring 11 goals in 33 appearances for the club, the Naples striker was widely criticized. The Italian national team will hold a pre-World Cup training camp in Rome, and Kwalialela was called up to the training camp by Li Pei in the face of widespread doubts. Critics think that Casano, Miccoli and Balotelli should go to South Africa for the World Cup instead of him. But Quaranta is convinced that he can win a place in Italy’s attack for this summer’s World Cup in South Africa.

黄培昭：巴以滥施武力事与愿违作者：黄培昭在经历了为期半年的相对平静之后，巴以重新爆发冲突。27日，以色列出动战斗机和武装直升机空袭加沙，目前已有包括巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动(哈马斯)高级军事官员在内的1000多人死伤。以色列何以对哈马斯大打出手？中东媒体分析认为，以色列主要出于三方面的考虑。一是报复哈马斯的火箭袭击。今年6月，以哈马斯为主的加沙巴勒斯坦派别与以色列达成为期半年的停火协议，协议至12月中旬到期。由此，巴以间的冲突开始升温。以色列军方说，自18日以来，哈马斯已向以色列境内发射了数百枚火箭。为此，以色列必须进行还击，以打击“恐怖主义”的“嚣张气焰”。二是出于国内政治的需要。明年初，以色列将举行大选。现在竞争态势激烈。利库德集团主席内塔尼亚胡等一直指责政府“软弱”，前进党党内不少人也认为奥尔默特“无能”，奥尔默特面临极大的压力。以当局大举空袭加沙，是各方压力的结果，只有这样，奥尔默特才能战败利库德集团等其它党派的竞争而赢得大选，否则就会像民调显示的那样，在明年初的选举中失利。三是以色列利用了美国政坛权力交接的真空。现在，总统布什卸任在即，当选总统奥巴马还没上任，以色列认为这一特殊时期是对哈马斯发动攻击的最佳时机。24日，以色列内阁开会，批准以国防军对哈马斯的军、政目标实施打击。以色列这一次采取了惯用的“闪电战”战术，各机种几乎在同一时间内协同作战，向加沙的近50处目标进行狂轰滥炸，造成重大伤亡。不过，从实际效果看，以色列要达到消灭哈马斯的目标很难实现。首先，如此大的伤亡必然引起国际社会的强烈不满和谴责，一些阿拉伯国家也要求召开紧急首脑会议讨论形势，报道称，阿拉伯国家联盟将在两天内举行紧急会议研究对策。其次，在伤亡面前，哈马斯会空前团结，并赢得更多的人心和支持者，这样，就与以色列的初衷事与愿违。事后，哈马斯发表声明，呼吁其手下军事人员及支持者以各种手段对以色列发起最猛烈的报复行动，哈马斯成员群情激昂，纷纷发誓要对以色列“以牙还牙”，让以色列变成“血的地狱”。连主流的巴民族解放运动(法塔赫)也站在哈马斯一边，对哈马斯受袭击并遭到沉重打击进行声援。巴临时政府宣布为期3天的“哀悼日”，悼念在以军空袭中丧生的巴勒斯坦人。当然，更严重的是，如果恶化局势，甚至失控，巴以将重新坠入暴力循环的怪圈，彻底断送中东和平进程。巴以冲突已经成为中东局势的“沉疴痼疾”，眼下，冲突的势头再度凸显，事态的发展令人担忧。实践证明，武力绝不是化解矛盾的办法，只有通过谈判实现和平，才是解决一切问题的真正出路。	黄培昭,哈马斯,内塔尼亚胡,奥尔默特,布什,奥巴马	负向	"Huang Peizhao: The Use of Force by Palestine and Israel Backfires Author: Huang Peizhao After a relatively peaceful period of half a year, Palestine and Israel have once again erupted into conflict. On the 27th, Israel launched airstrikes with fighter jets and armed helicopters on Gaza, and more than 1,000 people, including senior military officials of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), were killed and injured. Why did Israel attack Hamas so fiercely? Middle East media analysis believes that Israel mainly considers three aspects. One was in retaliation for Hamas’s rocket attacks. In June this year, Hamas and the Gaza Palestinian faction, which was mainly represented, reached a ceasefire agreement with Israel, which was due to expire at the end of December. From then on, the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis began to heat up. The Israeli military said that Hamas had fired hundreds of rockets into Israeli territory since the 18th. For this, Israel must retaliate to strike at the “arrogance” of “terrorism”. Second, for the need of domestic politics. At the beginning of next year, Israel will hold a general election. The competition is now intense. Netanyahu, chairman of Likud, and others have long accused the government of being “weak,” and many in Kadima believe that Olmert is “inept.” Olmert is under great pressure. The authorities' extensive bombing of Gaza was the result of pressure from all sides, and only in this way could Olmert defeat the competition from other parties such as Likud in the elections, otherwise he would lose the election as the polls showed, in the elections early next year. Israel took advantage of the power vacuum during the U.S. political transition. Now that President Bush is about to leave office and President-elect Obama has not yet taken office, Israel believes that this special period is the best time to launch an attack on Hamas. On the 24th, the Israeli cabinet held a meeting to approve the IDF's military and political targets in Hamas. Israel once again used its customary “lightning war” tactic, with all aircraft types operating in concert at nearly the same time, pounding nearly 50 targets in Gaza with massive bombing runs, causing heavy casualties. However, in terms of actual results, it is difficult for Israel to achieve its goal of eliminating Hamas. First, such a large number of casualties will inevitably arouse strong dissatisfaction and condemnation from the international community, and some Arab countries also demand an emergency summit meeting to discuss the situation. It is reported that the Arab League will hold an emergency meeting in two days to study countermeasures. Second, Hamas will unite more than ever in the face of casualties, and win more hearts and supporters, thus going against Israel’s original intention. Afterwards, Hamas issued a statement calling on its military personnel and supporters to launch the most intense retaliatory actions against Israel in various ways. Hamas members were all fired up, vowing to retaliate against Israel ""eye for an eye"" and make Israel a ""sea of blood"". Even the mainstream Palestinian Liberation Organization (Fatah) stood with Hamas, condemning the attack and its heavy toll. The interim Palestinian government declared a three-day period of mourning for Palestinians killed in the Israeli air raid. Of course, more seriously, if the situation deteriorates further and even gets out of control, the cycle of violence between the Palestinians and Israelis will restart, and the Middle East peace process will be completely ruined. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become a “chronic ailment” of the Middle East situation, and now, the momentum of the conflict is becoming more prominent, and the development of the situation is worrying. Practice has proved that force is not a way to resolve contradictions. The only way to solve all problems is to achieve peace through negotiation."

今年IPO募资下降近八成王锦据统计，包括上海电气不筹资IPO在内，今年以来共有77家公司通过IPO亮相沪深两市。除上海电气外的76家公司共募集资金约1034亿元，平均发行市盈率27倍。由于股市深幅调整，今年IPO发行同比大幅缩水，IPO家数与2007年的123家相比减少38%，募集资金总额与2007年的4770亿元相比减少78%。除发行节奏大幅放缓外，今年以来大盘股IPO寥寥无几，仅5家公司发行数量在5亿股以上，占IPO总家数的6%，而去年该比例为17%。不过，大盘股仍扮演了主要融资角色。这5家公司共募集资金733亿元，占今年IPO募资总额的70%。今年IPO公司中，中煤能源募资金额最高，达256亿元；中国南车发行股份数量最大，为30亿股。尽管12月份尚余13个交易日，但业内人士估计，年内重启IPO的可能性非常小。民族证券策略分析师表示，目前市场融资功能完全取决于市场好坏。如果有跨年度行情，明年1月份或一季度可能会有一些中小板IPO试探性出来。不过，日信证券首席策略分析师徐海洋表示，目前市场环境不具备重启IPO的条件，至少3个月内看不到IPO开闸的希望。国金证券策略研究员徐炜也表示，重启IPO最早可能要到明年一季度末二季度初，管理层会更多考虑市场情况。上海QDII募集规模比上季下降近7成□记者钱妤晚报讯相对于信托类和债券以及货币市场工具类理财产品的继续稳健增长，上海市场的结构性理财产品和QDII业务募集规模下降，分别比上季下降33.61%和64.58%。尤其是中小型银行，上述两类业务的募集金额下降最为显著。上海银监局昨日发布的《2008年第三季度个人理财业务分析报告》显示，截至2008年9月末，上海市场个人理财产品余额为1342.26亿元，比上季末增长25.47%，比去年同期增长64.62%；共募集资金1356.20亿元，比上季增长5.14%，比去年同期增长74.35%。三季度，上海市场商业银行个人理财业务以人民币理财业务为主导的市场格局特点更加显著。三季度共募集人民币理财产品1271.57亿元，占到理财产品募集总量的91.7%。人民币理财业务集中于信托理财和债券及货币市场工具类的理财产品，两类理财产品募集资金总量分别为604.66亿元和573.56亿元，占比分别达到44.58%和42.29%。	王锦,徐海洋,徐炜,钱妤	正向	"This year, the amount of funds raised by IPOs has dropped by nearly 80% according to Wang Jin. Statistics show that so far this year, a total of 77 companies have made their debut on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges through IPOs, excluding Shanghai Electric's IPO without fundraising. The 76 companies other than Shanghai Electric raised about 103.4 billion yuan in funds, with an average P/E ratio of 27 times. Due to the deep adjustment of the stock market, the number of IPOs issued this year has decreased significantly compared to the same period last year, with the number of IPOs decreasing by 38% compared to 123 in 2007, and the total amount of funds raised decreasing by 78% compared to 4770 billion yuan in 2007. Apart from the significantly slowed issuance pace, there have been few large-cap IPOs so far this year, with only five companies issuing more than 500 million shares, accounting for 6% of the total number of IPOs, compared to 17% last year. But large caps still played a major financing role. These five companies raised a total of 73.3 billion yuan in funds, accounting for 70% of the total IPO fundraising this year. Among the IPO companies this year, China Coal Energy raised the most funds, reaching 25.6 billion yuan; China South Rail issued the largest number of shares, 3 billion shares. Despite 13 trading days remaining in December, insiders estimate that the resumption of IPOs this year is unlikely. The strategy analyst of Minsheng Securities said that the current market financing function depends entirely on the good or bad of the market. If there is a cross-year situation, there may be some SME board IPOs in January or the first quarter next year. However, Xu Haiyang, chief strategy analyst of Nomura Securities, said that the current market environment does not meet the conditions for restarting the IPO, and there is no hope of seeing the IPO opening within three months. Xu Wei, a strategy researcher at Guo Jin Securities, also said that the resumption of IPOs may not be until the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter next year, and the management will consider the market situation more.

In particular, medium and small-sized banks have seen the most significant decline in the amount raised from the two types of business. The Shanghai Banking Regulatory Bureau's ""2008 Third Quarter Personal Wealth Management Business Analysis Report"" released yesterday shows that as of the end of September 2008, the balance of personal wealth management products in the Shanghai market was 134.226 billion yuan, up 25.47% from the end of the previous quarter and up 64.62% from the same period last year; a total of 135.62 billion yuan was raised, up 5.14% from the previous quarter and up 74.35% from the same period last year.

意名记：罢工扇了百万球迷巴掌触到历史最可笑的一点《米兰体育报》安德雷阿·蒙蒂恭喜，给你们打分：3分。献给所有主席、球员和行政机构，你们秉承一贯风格，在一场超现实的比赛后给出了大家习以为常的结果：全是输家，没赢家。这个周末，在空荡荡的看台上，足球幽灵在徘徊游荡，或许庆祝着整个意大利这记漂亮的大乌龙。这次罢工、或封锁、或推迟——你们想怎么叫都可以——是扇在数百万足球爱好者脸上的巴掌。足球界的绅士们富豪们，请别做梦了，球迷软弱，但不是傻子，想挽回失去的民心、挽回你们已经失去还在下落的信用，想修复乌龙造成的损伤，那可不是一两天能实现的。你们搬石头砸自己脚，将来的苦果有你们好受。任何企图剖析问题实质在于集体合同这一条、那一条的人，省省力气吧，现实是我们触到历史最低点最可笑的一点，意大利足球体制的危机即政治、经济危机才是根本，看，没一个人能控制局面，没人能改变乌龙的轨迹，这说明涉事所有人罪过同等。人民将怨气发在球员身上，对，他们确是被惯坏的偶像，整天以摇滚明星自居，只要自己稍不如意被分在另一组训练，就觉得天大冤情，自述为失业者。是啊，他们是地球上最富有的下岗工人。但也得看到，多数球员是职业、敬业的，没有挑三拣四。尽管托马西无能，可还是在避免破裂。最终摇头的是老板们，我们足球的核心人物。他们很荒诞，空前的团结又空前的内部分歧。如果球员被宠坏，是他们宠的；如果一个球队有50个球员，那也是他们买的；财政赤字，他们搞的。如果说贝雷塔像个跳梁小丑，过错不是某条法律，而是老板们的权力太大，无边际不受制约。可球员支付额外税赋、和所有公民义务一样这么简单的事都搞不定，他们的权力似乎对上不对下了。德拉瓦莱的足球证监会建议，有人赞成有人反对，我觉得这条路对了。足球投资者需尽快找到一个专业人士或团队，享有独立权力和思考空间来制定新的足球规则，将其推广，与其他领域主体沟通。更重要的，是要制定出整体推广意甲产品、将价值最大化的全面市场方案，学习英超、西甲的团结和境外扩张模式。别再抱怨球星出逃，别再指责意甲观赏性战斗力下降，再不切正要害流于皮毛之说，我们真的要沦为欧洲乡村了。里诺·邦菲(电影《足球教练》主人公)说过：“没买成苏格拉底，我们就买亚里士多德。反正所有动作，都要遵从哲学逻辑。”	安德雷阿·蒙蒂,托马西,贝雷塔,德拉瓦莱,里诺·邦菲	正向	"SportMediaset: The strike slapped a million fans in the face and touched the most ridiculous point of history. Greetings, I give you the score: 3. Andrea Monti of La Gazzetta dello Sport To all the presidents, players and administrative bodies, you have given us the usual result, as in a surreal game: all losers, no winners. This weekend, the ghost of football was wandering in the empty stands, perhaps celebrating a beautiful own goal for all of Italy. This strike, or blockade, or delay – call it what you will – is a slap in the face of millions of football fans. Gentlemen of the football world, the rich and the powerful, do not dream, fans are weak, but not fools, to win back the lost hearts and minds, to win back the credit you have lost and are still falling, to repair the damage caused by the own goal, that is not something that can be achieved in a day or two. You are throwing stones at your own feet, and you will have to taste the bitter fruits in the future. Any attempt to analyze the essence of the problem in terms of one or another clause of the collective contract is a waste of breath, for the reality is that the most laughable aspect of reaching the historical low point is the crisis of the Italian football system, which is a political and economic crisis. Look, no one can control the situation, no one can change the trajectory of the blunder, which indicates that all those involved are equally guilty. The people vent their anger on the players, yes, they are spoiled idols who consider themselves rock stars, and feel it is a great injustice if they are not in the same group for training, and describe themselves as unemployed. Yes, they are the most wealthy laid-off workers on the earth. But it is also true that most players are professional and dedicated, without being picky. Though Tomasi was incompetent, he was still trying to avoid a breakdown. In the end, it was the bosses, our core figures in football, who shook their heads. They are absurd, united unprecedentedly but also divided unprecedentedly. If the players are spoiled, it is because they are spoiled; if a team has 50 players, it is because they bought them; and the fiscal deficit, they caused it. If Beretta is like a clown, the fault is not a certain law, but that the bosses have too much power, without boundaries and uncontrolled. Players, like all citizens, seem to have powers that are effective upwards but not downwards, when it comes to paying extra taxes. The Délavall Football Regulatory Commission suggested that there were supporters and opponents, and I think this is the right way. Football investors need to find a professional or a team as soon as possible, with independent power and thinking space to formulate new football rules, promote them, and communicate with other stakeholders in other fields. More importantly, a comprehensive marketing strategy to promote Serie A products and maximize their value should be developed, learning from the unity and overseas expansion model of the Premier League and La Liga. Stop complaining about the stars leaving, stop blaming the decline in观赏性 and combativeness of Serie A, stop saying that we are just superficial and not hitting the key points. We really are going to become a European village. Rino Bongiorno, the protagonist of the film ""The Football Coach"", said, ""If we couldn't buy Socrates, we would buy Aristotle."" All actions must conform to philosophical logic, anyway. """

基金投资策略渐入窄门偏股基金连续数月雷同本报记者周宏如果把过去2个月中，基金发布的股票投资策略做个统计的话，结果可能是惊人的相似。以震荡市为主要判断，以消费、新能源等行业为投资主题，偏股基金的投资策略，连续数月雷同已是不争的事实。如同一个生命一样，基金的投资策略应该也有其发端、发展、成熟乃至逐步修正的过程。但在A股市场行情迅速演绎的这两个月，基金的投资策略却两个月未变。是什么造就了基金策略们的“尴尬”？结构性策略依旧不知道什么时候，“捕捉机构性机会”成为基金行业里对于下阶段投资策略的“唯一主题词”。以上周公布的一家合资基金的投资观点为例，“鉴于宏观政策的不确定性，预计大盘将继续维持震荡格局，中小盘题材股长期活跃后累积了丰厚的获利盘，有调整空间，但权重股下行空间不大。板块方面，我们看好具有较强抗风险能力、稳定增长的行业。”而早在几个月前，类似的推论已经在行业内铺天盖地。基金半年报中，包括广发、华安等大型基金管理公司旗下基金均众口一词的关注“新兴产业”、“大消费”的组合。而包括新能源、电动汽车、稀土等上游原材料组成的战略新兴产业，以及食品饮料、医药、农业、家电、零售等大消费产业，早在那时已经成为基金经理们口边的热门行业。及至目前，这种状况仍未有太多改变。宏观政策两难那么其中的原因又在哪里呢？不少基金经理认为，原由来自于目前的宏观经济环境。博时基金一位基金经理就认为，经济转型不会一蹴而就，特别是在当前经济增速下滑的情况下，增长速度让位于经济结构调整将是长期趋势，尤其未来几年中预计资源、劳动力等生产要素使用成本逐步提高，人民币渐进升值；在保证投资和出口稳定增长情况下，社会保障力度逐步提高，而这个过程中，消费服务和科技创新将会获得更多的政策支持。还有基金认为，CPI同比3.5%的数据再次引发了市场对于加息的猜测。但考虑到未来物价涨幅有望平稳回落、经济运行仍存在不确定性，利率不大可能大幅上调，年内仍以保持稳定为主。如果物价涨幅继续走高，也不排除央行小幅提高基准利率的可能，以改善负的实际利率状况，管理通胀预期。在这样辗转的宏观经济下，投资要理清头绪确实有不小的压力。行业配置“惯性思维”同样可能影响基金经理的还包括惯性的投资思维。而这种思维，往往成为各类行业极端性表现的代表。业内一位颇有影响力的投资总监，此前就表示，避险情绪正在主导整个机构群体，不断把非周期类股的估值推向极致。“这是个情绪化的看法，非周期类公司的风险就真的没有？周期类公司真的业绩一直不理想？”他反问道。而业内或许已经出现了另一种判断，上投摩根的基金经理王振州表示，从经济周期的角度看，今年四季度和明年一季度，GDP预计将会在8以上，实体经济的情况好于先前的预期，因此大盘向下的空间已经不大。另外，由于和整个经济状况的相关性较高，一直以来低PE的蓝筹股的机会也将显现。当然，目前，这个观点在业内仍是少数。	周宏,王振州	正向	"Fund investment strategy is gradually narrowing the door, and equity funds are similar for several months in a row. Reporter Zhou Hong If we make a statistical summary of the stock investment strategy of funds in the past two months, the result may be surprisingly similar. With the震荡market as the main judgment, and consumption, new energy and other industries as the investment theme, the investment strategy of equity funds has been the same for several consecutive months. Like a life, a fund’s investment strategy should also have a beginning, development, maturity, and even a gradual correction process. But the investment strategy of the funds remained unchanged in these two months when the A-share market was rapidly unfolding. What made the fund strategies' ""awkward""? Structural strategies are still in the dark about when, but ""capturing structural opportunities"" has become the only theme for the next stage of investment strategies in the fund industry. Taking the investment views of a joint venture fund announced last week as an example, ""Given the uncertainty of macro policies, the large-cap index is expected to continue to maintain an oscillating pattern. After the small and medium-sized cap theme stocks have been active for a long time, they have accumulated a substantial profit, and there is room for adjustment, but the large-cap stocks have limited room to fall."" In terms of sectors, we are bullish on industries with strong risk resistance and stable growth. Such speculations had been rampant in the industry months earlier. In the semi-annual report of the fund, the large fund management companies such as Guangfa and Huana all focus on the combination of ""new industries"" and ""large consumption"". And even back then, strategic emerging industries, which include new energy, electric vehicles, rare earths, and upstream raw materials, as well as large consumer sectors such as food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, home appliances, and retail, had already become popular sectors among fund managers. Up to now, there has been little change in this situation. What is the difficulty of macro policy, and where does it come from? Many fund managers believe that the root cause is the current macroeconomic environment. One fund manager at Bosera Fund believes that economic transformation will not be achieved in one fell swoop, especially in the current situation of slowing economic growth, and the adjustment of economic structure will take precedence over growth rate in the long term. In the coming years, it is expected that the cost of production factors such as resources and labor will gradually increase, and the RMB will gradually appreciate. Under the premise of ensuring stable growth of investment and exports, the intensity of social security will gradually increase, and during this process, consumption services and scientific and technological innovation will receive more policy support. And another fund believes that the 3.5% year-on-year CPI data has once again sparked market speculation about interest rate hikes. But given the expectation that inflation will stabilize and economic growth remains uncertain, interest rates are unlikely to be raised significantly, and stability will still be the main theme for the year. If inflation continues to rise, the central bank may also raise the benchmark interest rate slightly to improve the negative real interest rate situation and manage inflation expectations. In such a tortuous macroeconomic environment, it is indeed a great pressure to clarify the investment priorities. The industry allocation ""inertial thinking"" may also affect fund managers, including inertial investment thinking. And this kind of thinking often becomes the representative of the extremes in various industries. An influential investment director in the industry has previously stated that risk aversion is currently dominating the entire institutional group, pushing the valuation of non-cyclical stocks to extremes. This is an emotional view. Is the risk of non-cyclical companies really non-existent? Are cyclically companies really not performing well? He asked in return. There may be another judgment in the industry. Wang Zhenzhou, a fund manager of Shanghai Pute Morgan, said that from the perspective of the economic cycle, the GDP is expected to be above 8 in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. The actual situation of the real economy is better than the previous expectation, so the space for the large market to go down is not big. Moreover, the opportunities for low PE blue chips will also emerge, given their high correlation with the overall economic situation. Of course, this view is still in the minority in the industry at present."

The first interchangeable lens DC Panasonic G1 (materials, reviews, pictures, samples) introduction. Five years ago, a person with a DSLR camera walking on the street, most people would definitely think he was a photographer or a photography enthusiast. If someone is holding a DSLR now, most people would think that he is a photography enthusiast or a photography lover, of course, he may also be a photography beginner. DSLR cameras, as a high-quality imaging tool for photography, quickly moved from the halls of noble photography to widespread use, allowing more people to enjoy the fun of creating high-quality images. Meanwhile, some photography enthusiasts also gradually felt that DSLR was not so perfect, and the DSLR photography system (including lenses and bodies) became a sweet burden for long journeys, especially for female friends who love photography, it was inevitable to be powerless in the face of tens of pounds of photography equipment. Even some professional photographers are interested in the compact and high-quality DC, and in this context, the light single-lens reflex and high-quality DC are growing rapidly to compete for this huge and naive market. In terms of the appearance of the body, Panasonic G1 has three colors of body, red, blue and black, to meet the personal preferences and personalized needs of users.

The night before (June 11), the media saw the two people eating hotpot in Dong District. When the two people got off the car to go home, it was found that George's beach pants had dropped to the knee, and his naked buttocks were exposed on the street. Yesterday (June 12), Caikangyong, who works in Shanghai, explained, ""George was showing off the sunburn on his waist at that time, which had already been sunburned on his swimming pants.""

There was another male friend with them. On that night, Cai Kengan wore a baseball cap, while his boyfriend wore sunglasses and beach shorts. During the meal, the three people continued to discuss literary topics, and Cai Kengan also said to his boyfriend, ""Have you seen the poem he faxed to me?"" The conversation was quite profound.

古巴美国在哈瓦那举行新一轮移民问题谈判新华网哈瓦那2月19日电(记者刘彤)古巴和美国政府代表团19日在哈瓦那就移民问题举行闭门谈判。这是自2009年7月14日重开移民谈判以来，古美两国政府举行的第二轮移民谈判。古巴外交部副部长达戈韦托·罗德里格斯和美国国务院负责西半球事务的助理国务卿帮办克雷格·凯利分别率领两国代表团参加了谈判。古巴代表团在谈判结束后发表的新闻公报说，双方在谈判中评估了两国已达成的移民协定的执行情况，并讨论了古方在上一轮谈判时所提出的有关移民问题新草案的相关内容。公报说，古方在谈判中重申了古巴在移民问题上所持的立场，即确保两国之间实现合法、安全和有序的移民，并在打击非法人口贩卖方面实施有效合作。古方同时还表示愿在合适的时候继续与美国举行移民谈判。罗德里格斯在谈判中表示，古巴方面严格执行了与美国在1994年签署的移民协定，但美国仍在执行的所谓《古巴移民修正法》导致两国之间无法实现合法、安全和有序的移民。美国政府颁布的《古巴移民修正法》规定，凡是古巴人，只要踏上美国的领土，美国就给予居留权。这实际上是在怂恿古巴一些非法移民不顾性命危险偷渡到美国。1959年古巴革命胜利后，美国政府曾采取鼓励古巴人逃离祖国的政策，然而大量非法移民的进入也给美国社会造成巨大压力。1994年，美古两国政府签署协定，古方保证采取措施制止对美非法移民，美方则同意每年接收至少两万名古巴合法移民。根据古美移民协定，两国每年应举行至少一次移民谈判，以评估移民协定的执行情况。2003年，布什政府以古巴政府缺乏诚意为由，无限期推迟同古巴的移民谈判。奥巴马入主白宫后，两国政府重新恢复了移民谈判。	刘彤,达戈韦托·罗德里格斯,罗德里格斯,克雷格·凯利,布什,奥巴马	正向	The United States and Cuba held new rounds of migration talks in Havana. Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 19 (Reporter Tong Rong) The Cuban and US government delegations held closed-door talks on migration issues in Havana on February 19. This is the second round of immigration talks between the two governments since the resumption of immigration negotiations between Cuba and the US on July 14, 2009. Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Dagoberto Rodriguez and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Craig Kelly led their respective delegations in the negotiations. The Cuban delegation's press release after the negotiations said that both sides evaluated the implementation of the bilateral migration agreement reached and discussed the new draft on migration issues proposed by the Cuban side in the previous round of negotiations. The communiqué said that Cuba reaffirmed its position on migration issues in the negotiations, namely, ensuring legal, safe, and orderly migration between the two countries, and implementing effective cooperation in combating illegal trafficking in persons. The ancient formula also expressed its willingness to continue immigration talks with the US at an appropriate time. Rodriguez said that Cuba had strictly implemented the immigration agreement signed with the United States in 1994, but the so-called Cuban Immigrant Amendment that the United States was still implementing prevented the two countries from achieving legal, safe and orderly immigration. The Cuban Adjustment Act, promulgated by the US government, stipulates that any Cuban who steps on the territory of the United States will be granted residence. This actually encourages some illegal immigrants in Cuba to risk their lives to illegally immigrate to the United States. After the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the U.S. government adopted a policy of encouraging Cubans to leave their homeland, but the entry of a large number of illegal immigrants also put great pressure on American society. In 1994, the governments of the United States and Cuba signed an agreement, under which Cuba promised to take measures to stop illegal migration to the United States, and the United States agreed to receive at least 20,000 legal Cuban immigrants annually. Under the ancient and modern migration agreement, the two countries should hold at least one migration negotiation every year to evaluate the implementation of the migration agreement. In 2003, the Bush administration indefinitely postponed negotiations with Cuba on immigration, citing a lack of Cuban诚意. After Obama moved into the White House, the two governments resumed the immigration talks.
基金借创新突围困局：股指期货增添新砝码一季度以来，14只具有创新特质的基金产品“驰援”A股市场，占新发基金数量的39%，甚至出现一日四只创新产品齐发的局面。“创新”几乎成为今年基金行业被谈论最多的话题，而股指期货和融资融券业务的正式推出，更进一步打开了基金产品创新的策略空间。纵观年内发行的各基金产品，“创新”的份量也越来越重，指数产品风格化、杠杆使用频繁化、QDII出海多元化、ETF及其联接基金大行其道。然而，在这些产品创新的背后，却体现出基金业试图突破产品同质化严重、销售靠天吃饭、行业利润率下降等困境的努力。⊙本报记者马全胜孙旭多路齐发创新迭出截至4月19日，今年以来共有36只新基金开始发行，其中，32只投向境内市场，4只为QDII，风格化指数产品、带杠杆的分级基金、ETF及其联接基金成为主流。此外，境内首只采用LOF模式的QDII基金——国投瑞银全球新兴市场精选股票基金也将于近期发行；海富通基金已在准备发行可同时投资于A股及H股市场的“两栖”QDII产品；华安基金和富时集团也已达成协议，授权开发针对富时100指数的跨境ETF产品……创新基金产品正以前所未有的态势迅速填补着我国各细分市场领域的空白。在各类创新产品中，首先，指数基金的风格化渐渐成为一大潮流。无论是日前结束募集的首只行业指数基金——国投瑞银沪深300金融地产指数基金，还是首只A股市场风格指数ETF及其联接基金——华宝兴业上证180价值ETF及其联接基金，或是首只跟踪创新基本面指数的泰达宏利中证财富大盘指数基金，都是在2009年指数基金爆发式发展的基础上开发出来的风格化指数产品。“一方面，由于指数基金作为被动性投资产品，标的指数具有较强的排他性，为了避免同质化竞争，基金公司必须积极创新，开发具有不同风格特征的指数产品；另一方面，随着去年指数基金的大扩容，新指数的开发也呈现加速发展和差异化设计的态势；因此，发行不同风格特征的指数基金具备了多方面条件。”长信中证央企100指数基金经理许万国一语中的。安信证券首席金融工程师付强判断，“风格、行业和主题指数产品将是2010年指数基金的发行主流，在传统指数基金与ETF的竞争性发展格局上，今年ETF将获得优势，这主要是因为联接基金打通了ETF的银行渠道。”对于代表着当前最具创新水准的分级基金，由于其自身所具有的杠杆特性、可满足不同投资者的细分需求、以及存在多重交易策略选择，颇受市场关注。国联安基金公司副总经理王峰表示，“与国内现有基金产品同质化现象完全不同，分级基金通过其特有的基金收益分配制度对基金风险收益进行重新划分，建立杠杆效应，填补了追求高收益或稳定收益投资需求的空白。”根据记者从多家公司了解到的信息，目前正在加紧筹备的分级基金，包括债券分级基金，就有5只之多。此外，对于QDII基金的再度出海，目前已有国泰纳斯达克100指数、工银瑞信全球精选、长盛环球景气行业大盘等三只新产品上市发行。国泰君安证券基金分析师吴天宇表示，被动化投资和跨境ETF的出现将是今年QDII产品的新特点。据悉，当前市场已有多只QDII指数产品正在准备中。其中，鹏华基金已被授权开发摩根斯丹利资本国际公司旗下6只指数的ETF产品，博时基金也已获得开发标普500跨境ETF的授权。创新突围多角度求解然而，就在创新产品逐渐走向“深水区”之际，摆在基金公司面前的却是行业利润率逐渐下降、新基金发行难度加大、基民“赎老买新”等一系列难题。根据安信证券近期研究报告，自我国开放式基金诞生以来，2009年开放式基金首次出现了现金流为负的纪录。2009年开放式基金的净赎回为3588亿元，分红为730亿元，各种运营费用为381亿元，考虑3470亿元的新基金发行，现金流出量达到了1230亿元。尽管去年新基金的发行在很大程度上平滑了基金净赎回带来的影响，但如果从份额角度看，我国基金行业依然处于被净赎回状态。市场分析人士认为，“产品单一”和“渠道单一”是造成目前基金业拓展市场份额困局的主要原因。“放眼目前的基金市场，尽管几百只基金名目繁多，但基本模式和品种都差不多，这同市场的需求是脱节的。市场细分不到位，市场潜力无法得到充分挖掘，大量雷同的‘概念’降低了市场对于基金的投资热情；同时，基金销售渠道不够多元化，高峰时银行渠道过分拥堵，无法对每只在发基金都‘竭尽所能’去营销，基金产品的销售也就无法实现‘公平’和‘充分’。”一位银行理财师表示。日前，在中国证券投资基金年会上，易方达基金副总裁刘晓艳表示，“今年基金销售特别难，其原因不是因为产品过多，而是因为产品同质性太强，真正提供给客户的创新产品不多。”招商银行零售银行部副总经理张东则认为，“市场是有需求的，如果能够开发出客户需要的产品，基金销售其实并不困难，如银华基金旗下的保本基金募集当天就卖掉了48亿，最后启动了比例配售。”国泰君安证券金融工程负责人蒋瑛琨分析，未来基金创新领域可能主要向三个方向发展：其一，随着融资融券和股指期货的推出，基金产品创新的策略空间已被充分打开，就股指期货与ETF的结合就有很多创新可做；其二，基金的交易方式上会有所创新，特别是未来如果基金引入股指期货进行流动性管理的话，换手率会进一步降低，相应的投资成本也会降低；其三，基金产品的结构也会逐渐合理，保本型和杠杆型基金的创新方式将不断深化。事实上，为了促进基金行业发展，监管层正在不遗余力地推动基金产品的创新。在基金分类审批中，监管层为创新产品开辟了绿色通道，使得今年创新产品获批的速度加快。上交所副总经理徐明此前表示，上交所已同意有关基金公司开发追踪海外指数的跨境ETF，技术系统、后台服务等各项准备工作已基本就绪。深交所相关负责人表示，深交所将着力从国际化、指数化、结构化三个方向推动基金在交易所平台的发展。基金市场的蛋糕有望通过创新这一“发酵剂”实现扩大。此外，从目前的创新基金品种来看，大多数产品属于交易所交易的场内基金。分析人士指出，场内基金的交易品种日趋多样化、交易费用的相对低廉、以及交易方式的快速便捷使得场内基金具有较大的吸引力；场内交易基金的创新也可以有效拓宽券商等多个基金销售渠道，缓解基金拥堵扎堆发行的现象，使得基金销售更加充分和到位。创新之路并不平坦股指期货增添新砝码目前看来，基金产品的创新之路似乎并不平坦。有基金研究员人士指出，基金投资人是基金产品的需求方，是牵引基金产品发展与创新的根本性力量；而在当前A股市场，投资人往往将长期需求短期化，随着市场热点变化而追求短期内表现较好的基金；因此，未来基金产品的创新需要投资者教育工作和新产品开发设计并重。银河证券基金分析师王群航指出，受去年五月份长盛同庆成功发行的影响，部分基金公司经过了将近一年时间的准备，终于发行了具有更多创新成分的分级基金。不过即使如此，由于从理论上无法解决上市之后加权收益率将会折价的困扰，这些被寄予了更多希望的新产品发行情况并不理想。更为糟糕的是，部分基金公司的市场营销人员对于此类产品的理解程度也许很有限，在营销推广方面或许会存在误导投资者的嫌疑。目前，股指期货成功推出，已将一些新的操作策略引入基金管理人的视野。蒋瑛琨博士向记者表示，“最近一段时间以来，基金公司就股指期货方面的咨询显著增加，公募基金对于套期保值的关注已在提升，而且关注的公司也越来越多；对于专户业务，基金公司的关注点主要表现在套利策略和交易系统方面，甚至有的公司还交流了要不要就股指期货设一些专门的交易员。”此外，记者从一家券商研究所获悉，包括易方达、大成、泰达宏利在内的其他基金公司也已在积极备战与股指期货对接的专户产品。大成基金金融工程部执行总监高贵鑫表示，在股指期货推出初期，将更偏向于推出有充分的把握、结构相对简单、策略简洁清晰的套保产品；在股指期货市场正常运转一段时间后，大成基金会采用实际的市场数据对大成基金的各项工作进行检验，在能够确保套利模型有效运转，系统效率、工作流程和人员素质确实能够匹配套利要求，同时流动性等市场环境也能够满足套利需求时，再推出这类产品。	马全胜,孙旭,许万国,付强,王峰,吴天宇,刘晓艳,张东,蒋瑛琨,徐明,王群航,高贵鑫	正向	"Funds break through the dilemma with innovation: Index futures add new weight Since the first quarter, 14 innovative fund products have ""rescued"" the A-share market, accounting for 39% of newly issued funds, and even a situation where four innovative products were launched on the same day has appeared. ""Innovation"" almost became the most talked about topic in the fund industry this year, and the official launch of index futures and margin trading business further opened up the strategic space for fund product innovation. Throughout the year, the weight of ""innovation"" in various fund products has also become heavier, with index products becoming more specialized, the frequent use of leverage, diversified QDII going overseas, and ETFs and their connected funds becoming increasingly popular. However, behind these product innovations, there is an effort by the fund industry to break through the serious product homogenization, sales relying on luck, and declining industry profit margins. ⊙Reporter Ma Quansheng and Sun Xuduo of the News Agency of China. Multiple new funds have been launched and innovation has been continuous. As of April 19, a total of 36 new funds have been launched this year, of which 32 have been invested in the domestic market, and 4 are QDII. Style-index products, leveraged分级 funds, ETFs and their connected funds have become mainstream. In addition, the first QDII fund in China to adopt the LOF model, the Guotou Ruiyuan Global Emerging Market Select Stock Fund, will be issued in the near future; Haitong Fund is preparing to issue a ""two-habitat"" QDII product that can invest in both A-shares and H-shares; Huaxun Fund and the FT Group have also reached an agreement to authorize the development of a cross-border ETF product targeting the FTSE 100 index… innovative fund products are filling the gaps in China's various niche market segments at an unprecedented pace. Among various innovative products, first, the stylization of index funds has gradually become a trend. Whether it is the first industry index fund – Guotou Ruiyuan CSI 300 Financial and Real Estate Index Fund – which ended the fundraising recently, or the first A-share market style index ETF and its connected fund – Huabao Xingye SSE 180 Value ETF and its connected fund, or the first index fund tracking the innovation fundamental index – TaiDa HongLi CSI Wealth Large Cap Index Fund, they are all stylized index products developed on the basis of the explosive development of index funds in 2009. On the one hand, due to the fact that index funds are passive investment products with strong exclusivity, in order to avoid homogenization competition, fund companies must actively innovate and develop index products with different style characteristics. On the other hand, with the large expansion of index funds last year, the development of new indexes also shows an accelerating and differentiated design trend. Therefore, the issuance of index funds with different style characteristics has been endowed with multi-faceted conditions. The phrase ""Longxin CSI Central SOE 100 Index Fund Manager Xu Wanguo hit the nail on the head."" is spot on. Fu Qiang, the chief financial engineer of China Securities, believes that style, industry and theme index products will be the mainstream of index funds in 2010. In the competitive development pattern of traditional index funds and ETFs, ETFs will gain an advantage this year, mainly because the connected fund has opened up the bank channel of ETFs. For the most innovative分级基金, due to its own leverage characteristics, ability to meet the细分需求 of different investors, and the existence of multiple trading strategies, it has attracted a lot of market attention. Wang Feng, the deputy general manager of Guolian'an Fund Company, said, ""Compared with the homogenization phenomenon of domestic existing fund products,分级 funds re-divide the risk and return of funds through their unique fund profit distribution system, establish a leveraged effect, and fill the gap in the investment demand for high returns or stable returns."" According to the information obtained by the journalists from several companies, there are as many as five分级基金, including bond分级基金, which are currently being prepared in a hurry. In addition, for the QDII fund to go overseas again, three new products, namely, the CHT NASDAQ 100 Index, ICBC R&Q Global Select, and Changsheng Global Industry Large Cap, have already been issued. Guo Taishang Securities fund analyst Wu Tianyu said that passive investment and cross-border ETFs will be the new features of QDII products this year. It is reported that there are already several QDII index products in preparation in the current market. Among them, Penghua Fund has been authorized to develop ETF products for six indices under MSCI, and Boti Fund has also obtained the authorization to develop SPDR S&P 500 Cross-border ETF. Innovation breakthroughs require multi-angle solutions, but at the same time, as innovative products gradually move towards the ""deep water zone"", fund companies are faced with a series of problems such as declining industry profit margins, increasing difficulty in issuing new funds, and fund holders redeeming old funds to buy new ones. According to the recent research report of Everbright Securities, since the birth of open-end funds in China, open-end funds first appeared in negative cash flow record in 2009. Net redemptions of open-end funds in 2009 were 358.8 billion yuan, dividends were 73 billion yuan, and various operating expenses were 38.1 billion yuan. Considering the issuance of 347 billion yuan in new funds, the cash outflow reached 123 billion yuan. Although the issuance of new funds last year smoothed the impact of net redemptions to a large extent, the fund industry in China was still in a net redemption state from the perspective of shares. Market analysts believe that the main reason for the current dilemma of fund industry in expanding its market share is ""single product"" and ""single channel"". Looking at the current fund market, although there are hundreds of funds with a wide variety of names, the basic models and types are basically the same, which is out of line with market demand. Market segmentation is inadequate, and the market potential cannot be fully tapped. A large number of similar ""concepts"" have reduced the market's enthusiasm for investing in funds. At the same time, the sales channels of funds are not diversified enough. During peak times, bank channels are too congested, and it is impossible to market every fund being issued ""to the best of our ability."" As a result, the sales of fund products cannot be achieved ""fairly"" and ""fully."" ""A bank financial advisor said."" Recently, at the China Securities Investment Fund Annual Conference, Liu Xiaoyan, the vice president of E Fund, said, ""This year, the sales of funds are particularly difficult, and the reason is not that there are too many products, but that the products are too similar, and there are not many innovative products provided to customers."" Zhang Dong, the deputy general manager of the retail banking department of China Merchants Bank, believes that ""the market has demand, and if we can develop the products that customers need, the sales of funds are not difficult. For example, the fund under the custody of Yinhua Fund was sold out 4.8 billion yuan on the day of fundraising, and the proportional allocation was finally launched."" Jiang Yingkun, the head of financial engineering at Guotai Junan Securities, analyzed that in the future, the field of fund innovation may mainly develop in three directions: First, with the introduction of margin trading and short selling and stock index futures, the strategy space for fund product innovation has been fully opened. There are many innovations that can be done in the combination of stock index futures and ETFs; second, there will be innovations in the trading methods of funds. In particular, if funds introduce stock index futures for liquidity management in the future, the turnover rate will be further reduced, and the corresponding investment cost will also be reduced; third, the structure of fund products will gradually become more reasonable, and the innovative methods of guaranteed and leveraged funds will continue to deepen. In fact, in order to promote the development of the fund industry, the regulatory authorities are making unremitting efforts to promote the innovation of fund products. In the fund classification approval, the regulatory authorities have opened a green channel for innovative products, which has accelerated the approval speed of innovative products this year. Xu Ming, the deputy general manager of the SSE, said previously that the SSE has agreed to allow fund companies to develop cross-border ETFs that track overseas indices, and all preparations for the technical system, back-end services, and other aspects are basically ready. The relevant person in charge of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange said that the Shenzhen Stock Exchange will focus on promoting the development of funds on the exchange platform from three directions: internationalization, indexation, and structuring. The cake of the fund market is expected to be expanded by innovation as a ""ferment"". In addition, from the current innovation fund products, most of the products belong to the in-market funds traded on the exchange. Analysts point out that the variety of trading varieties of in-market funds, relatively low trading fees, and the rapid and convenient trading methods make in-market funds have great appeal; the innovation of in-market trading funds can also effectively broaden the sales channels of multiple funds such as securities firms, alleviate the phenomenon of fund congestion and concentrated issuance, and make fund sales more thorough and effective. The road to innovation is not smooth, and stock index futures add new weight. At present, it seems that the road to innovation in fund products is not smooth. A fund researcher pointed out that fund investors are the demand side of fund products, and are the fundamental force driving the development and innovation of fund products; in the current A-share market, investors often turn long-term needs into short-term ones, and pursue funds with better short-term performance with the changes of market hotspots; therefore, in the future, the innovation of fund products should focus on both investor education and new product development and design. Wang Qunhang, a fund analyst of Galaxy Securities, pointed out that, influenced by the successful issuance of Changsheng Tongqing in May last year, some fund companies, after nearly a year of preparation, finally issued分级 funds with more innovative components. Nevertheless, these new product launches, which were expected to be more successful, did not fare well, as theoretically there was no way to address the discounting of the weighted yield after listing. Worse still, some fund companies' marketing personnel may have a limited understanding of such products, and there may be a risk of misleading investors in marketing and promotion. Currently, the stock index futures have been successfully launched, and have introduced some new operational strategies to the horizon of fund managers. Dr. Jiang Yingkun told the press that in recent days, the number of inquiries from fund companies about index futures has increased significantly. The concern of public funds for hedging has been increasing, and the number of companies paying attention has also increased. For dedicated account business, the focus of fund companies is mainly on arbitrage strategies and trading systems, and some companies even exchanged whether they should set up special traders for index futures. In addition, according to a securities firm research institute, other fund companies, including Fosun, Dacheng, and Taeda Hongli, are also actively preparing for dedicated account products that will be linked to stock index futures. Gu Gaixin, the executive director of the financial engineering department of Dacheng Fund, said that in the early stage of the introduction of stock index futures, they would prefer to launch hedging products with sufficient confidence, relatively simple structure, and clear strategies; after a period of normal operation of the stock index futures market, Dacheng Fund will use actual market data to test all the work of Dacheng Fund. When the arbitrage model can ensure the effective operation, the system efficiency, work process and personnel quality can indeed match the arbitrage requirements, and the market environment such as liquidity can also meet the arbitrage needs, Dacheng Fund will launch such products."
尾盘杀跌难改温和调整格局⊙世基投资王利敏○编辑杨晓坤昨日大盘再现尾盘杀跌的一幕，沪市短时间内一度逼近2600点，但经多方最后20分钟的拉抬，仅小跌17点收盘，而且从个股涨跌比422：441来看，屡屡靠尾盘杀跌显然很难改变大盘温和调整的基本格局。市场再现尾盘杀跌尽管隔夜美股等周边市场依然强势，但地产等权重板块的走弱使昨日沪深股市多数时间处于绿盘交易，尤其是地产、金融、钢铁、有色、煤炭等权重板块的整体回落，使得代表指数的白线在昨日盘中显得相当疲软。但耐人寻味的是，代表中小盘等非权重股的黄线却屡屡往上走高。与权重股集体走弱相反，一是主板市场的医药、商业、酒类、农业以及旅游、军工等非权重板块相当活跃，二是前段时间表现平平的中小板、创业板再度走强。虽然沪综指跌破了5日、10日均线，而中小扳指以及创业扳指则双双运行于5日线上方。耐人寻味的是，如果没有2点钟以后的地产板块以及期指的一路杀跌，沪市原本很可能收出红盘，空方这一手法显然和本周二的借助利空传言尾盘杀跌，有异曲同工之妙。所以，屡屡用尾盘杀跌做空，其实表明空方底气不足。理当调整的几大理由大盘在经历了前段时间的逼空后，调整自在情理之中，理由相当充足。首先是大盘持续逼空使得技术面严重超买，需要调整。其一是上升斜率太陡，不利于行情的延续，要调整斜率，就得有个盘整的过程。其二是众多技术指标严重钝化或乖离率过大，需要有一个修正。其次是例如地产等众多权重股由于本轮行情涨幅已经不小，本身有个调整蓄势的过程。从这个意义上说，昨日在这些权重板块回调时，众多非主流板块以及中小板、创业板的活跃正好能够填补市场热点的匮乏。再次是光大银行发行上市在即以及一系列新的宏观经济数据即将公布，市场也有等一等的意愿。等到光大银行以及相关数据这两只靴子平稳落地后，再度上攻显然更加有利。另外，本轮行情由于采取了逼空方式，相当多投资者(包括机构)处于被轧空的尴尬境地，大盘回调一下，有利于争取更多的做多力量。温和调整是大概率昨日再现尾盘杀跌，使得大盘在跌破5日均线后进一步跌破了10日均线，调整的态势更趋明朗，以至市场对调整的方式分歧加大。我们不妨逐个分析。第一种方式是温和调整，以横盘、小阴小阳的方式进行。若如此，则一种可能是去拉头肩底的右肩，横盘一段时间后再度走高；另一种可能是稍作盘整后，等待20日均线上移后马上再度上攻。第二种方式是回落整理，形成第二个低点后，再度向上运行，类似于去年9月初从2639点上攻到3068点后，在回落到2712点后，再度上攻，形成低点不断抬高、高点不断上移的走势。第三种走势是就此结束上攻行情，重新考验2319点低点，不排除再创新低。笔者以为，第三种可能至少目前还没有这种迹象，基本可以排除。前两种可能中，我们倾向于第一种。所以，不管是做头肩底还是稍稍盘整再度上攻，对于踏空本轮行情者或仓位过轻者，应该是积极把握逢低吸纳的良机。	王利敏,杨晓坤	正向	End-of-day plunge could not change the mild adjustment pattern⊙Shi Ji Investment Wang Limin⊙Editor Yang Xiaokun The major market saw a scene of end-of-day plunge yesterday, with the Shanghai market approaching 2,600 points in a short period of time. However, after the多方最后20分钟的拉抬, the market only fell 17 points at the end of the day, and from the perspective of the number of stocks rising and falling, 422:441, repeatedly relying on end-of-day plunge is clearly difficult to change the basic pattern of the mild adjustment of the major market. The market fell at the end of the day, despite the strong performance of the surrounding markets such as the US stock market overnight. The weakness of the real estate and other heavyweights has made the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets mostly in the green trading, especially the overall decline of the real estate, financial, steel, non-ferrous metals, and coal, which made the white line representing the index look very weak during the trading day. But what is intriguing is that the yellow line, which represents small and medium-sized stocks and non-cap stocks, has been rising repeatedly. In contrast to the collective weakness of the heavyweights, the main board market was active in the pharmaceutical, commercial, alcoholic beverages, agriculture, tourism, and military industries, and the small and medium-sized board and the growth enterprise market, which had been underwhelming in the past, have regained strength. Although the Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, the SME Board Index and the Growth Enterprise Market Index were both above the 5-day moving average. It is interesting that the Shanghai market might have closed in the green without the real estate sector after 2:00 PM and the continuous plunge of the CSI 300 Index. The bearish strategy is clearly similar to the one used on Tuesday, when the market plunged at the end of the day on the rumor of bad news. So, repeatedly using the closing price to kill the market actually indicates that the bearish side lacks confidence. Several reasons why adjustments are inevitable after a prolonged one-sided advance in the major indices, and the reasons are more than sufficient. First, the major market continues to force an empty market, causing the technical face to be severely overbought and requiring adjustment. One is that the upward slope is too steep, which is not conducive to the continuation of the trend. To adjust the slope, a consolidation process is needed. The second is that a large number of technical indicators are severely dulled or have too large a deviation, and a correction is needed. Next, many heavyweights such as real estate have adjusted and consolidated their strength during this round of the market, with significant gains already. In this sense, the active performance of many non-mainstream sectors and small and medium-sized board and创业板 stocks when the major sectors adjusted yesterday just filled the lack of market hotspots. Also, the Everbright Bank is about to issue and list, and a series of new macroeconomic data will be released, and the market also has the willingness to wait. After the light industry bank and the relevant data have landed smoothly, it is obviously more advantageous to attack again. Moreover, since this round of market rally adopted a squeeze short position approach, a large number of investors (including institutions) are in an awkward situation of being squeezed short. A pullback of the market index would be conducive to winning more bullish forces. Gentle adjustments are likely to be a repeat of the previous day's closing plunge, which makes the market break below the 5-day moving average and then further break below the 10-day moving average, making the adjustment trend more evident, leading to greater divergence in the market's view on the way of adjustment. Let's analyze them one by one. The first method is a gentle adjustment, carried out in a horizontal range with small bullish and bearish candles. Then one possibility is to go long on the right shoulder of the head and shoulders bottom, and then rise after a period of consolidation; another possibility is to wait for the 20-day moving average to rise and then attack again after a short consolidation. The second method is a consolidation, forming a second low point, and then rising again, similar to the attack from 2639 points to 3068 points in early September last year, followed by a decline to 2712 points, and then another attack, forming a trend of continuously raising the low point and continuously raising the high point. The third scenario is that the upward trend ends here and retests the low point of 2319, which may even create a new low. I think the third possibility can be ruled out for now, at least, as there is no sign of it. Of the first two possibilities, we tend to favor the first. So, whether it is a head and shoulders bottom or a slight consolidation before another attack, it should be a good opportunity for those who missed the current trend or have too light a position to buy at a low price.
高校自主招生获奖材料只限高中阶段北京考试报讯(记者安京京)高校自主招生简章已陆续出台，有实力的考生纷纷摩拳擦掌，准备报考心目中的理想院校。有关招办负责人提醒考生，参加自主招生选拔提交获奖材料时，只要提供高中阶段、省级以上的证书即可。往年，有的考生为证明自己确实优秀，将从小学开始参加的各类大小比赛获奖证书全部复印投递给学校。北林大招办主任穆琳说，这样的申请材料太庞杂，反而不利于招办老师一目了然地看出该生的特长。考生的申请材料要适度，把最能反映自己特长和高中阶段主要成果的材料附上即可。初中或小学阶段的奖项无效，不必提供。同时，在送交申请材料时，招生简章中明确要求的必备材料要准备齐全，统一装订。北交大招办有关负责人介绍，该校要求考生网报时填写“报名依据”一项，考生要根据本人获奖情况及特长等归纳列举。报名依据一定要有代表性，并且能提供有说服力的证明材料。有符合优先条件的获奖一定要填写在“主要报名依据”中，同时在获奖情况中，考生要填写具体时间和获奖情况。由于邮寄书面材料需要一段时间，因此，考生尽量不要在报名快截止时才网报，这样会降低进入初审的几率。	安京京,穆琳	正向	"College entrance examination self-recruitment materials are only limited to high school stage. Beijing Examination News (Reporter An Jingjing) The college entrance examination self-recruitment outline has been issued in succession. Talented candidates are preparing to apply for the ideal colleges and universities they dream of. Admissions Office officials reminded candidates that when submitting award materials for autonomous recruitment selection, they only need to provide certificates from the high school stage and above the provincial level. In the past, some candidates would copy all the certificates of awards from various competitions they had participated in since primary school to prove that they were indeed excellent and send them to the school. Mu Lin, director of the Z North Forestry University admissions office, said that such application materials are too cumbersome and are not conducive to the admissions office teachers seeing at a glance the strengths of the student. Applicants should attach only the materials that best reflect their strengths and the main achievements of their high school years. Awards from junior high or primary school are not valid and need not be provided. At the same time, all the required documents specified in the prospectus must be prepared and bound together when submitting the application materials. The relevant person in charge of the ZBJU Admissions Office introduced that the school requires candidates to fill in the ""Application Basis"" item when registering online, and candidates should summarize and list according to their own award-winning situation and specialties, etc. The registration basis must be representative and provide convincing evidence. If there are awards that meet the priority conditions, they must be filled in the ""main application basis"", and at the same time, in the award situation, the candidates should fill in the specific time and award situation. Since it takes some time to mail written materials, candidates are advised not to apply online just before the deadline, as this will reduce the chances of passing the preliminary review."
李玮峰转会再陷僵局申花决策改变逼武汉叫停谈判新浪体育讯　尽管上海申花方面刚刚公开了愿意以28万人民币的身价，租借李玮峰到其他任何一个俱乐部，直至08赛季中超联赛结束。不过，李玮峰转会武汉一事的谈判，目前还是再次陷入了僵局。而这种僵局，缘起24小时之内，申花高层的一次决策改变。事实上，武汉方面最早给出申花的引进李玮峰的计划是一个：半年加一年的先租借后转会方案。对于这个方案，申花高层和武汉俱乐部高层的说法基本一致，据知情人士透露了这个方案的大致想法：“武汉先租借李玮峰半年，费用是28万，明年正式转会，转会费用在200万人民币左右的转会合同。”据了解，本来这个方案是申花负责此次谈判的某位董事与武汉方面交涉达成的口头协议，但是，此后不足24小时的时间里，申花还是抱歉的通知了武汉方面，最终还是否决了这个谈判内容。“他们否定了他们此前给我们开出的条件。我不理解上海申花俱乐部为何会拒绝这样一份优厚的转会合同。”从来没有与申花俱乐部进行过谈判工作的武汉俱乐部总经理徐志强的无奈，显然是他不了解申花在队员转会谈判中的高水平谈判技巧。之前，申花与西安方面就引进申花某中场大将的谈判，也是在24小时之内，推翻了之前双方敲定的价钱，而最终使得双方不得不宣布了谈判以失败结束。而申花与国安之间王珂的转会谈判，也是一波三折，僵局不断，最终也是在国安更换了谈判负责人等等妥协政策下才宣告成功。据悉，目前上海申花俱乐部坚持“只租不转”，不过申花方面也还是为武汉开出了明年转会谈判中的优待条件：“如果这次租借成功的话，申花愿意在租借合同中为武汉方面注名：武汉享有明年对于李玮峰的优先转会权。”只是对于转会费的问题，申花方面有消息透露：“明年武汉要引进李玮峰还是要从500万转会费开始谈，绝不可能是之前半年的价钱，这个也是正常的，毕竟明年是一年的转会费。”	李玮峰,徐志强,王珂	负向	"Despite the fact that the Shanghai Shenhua side has just publicly announced that they are willing to rent Li Weifeng to any other club, at a price of 280,000 RMB, until the end of the 2008 CSL season. However, the negotiations for Li Weifeng’s transfer to Wuhan are still at an impasse. And this deadlock originated from a decision change by the Shanghai Shenhua top management within 24 hours. In fact, Wuhan's earliest plan to introduce Li Weifeng to Shanghai Shenhua was a half-year plus one-year scheme of first loan and then transfer. For this plan, the upper management of Shanghai Shenhua and Wuhan club basically agreed. According to the insiders, the general idea of this plan is as follows: Wuhan will first borrow Li Weifeng for half a year, with a fee of 280,000, and a formal transfer next year, with a transfer fee of about 2 million RMB. It is understood that the oral agreement reached between the relevant director of Shanghai Shenhua and Wuhan was originally responsible for the negotiation of this plan, but Shanghai Shenhua still apologized to Wuhan within less than 24 hours, and ultimately rejected this negotiation content. They have rejected the terms they offered us previously. I do not understand why Shanghai Shenhua Club refused such a generous transfer contract. The Wuhan club’s general manager, Xu Zhiqiang, who had never negotiated with the Shanghai Shenhua club, was clearly unaware of the high-level negotiation skills of the Shanghai Shenhua club in player transfer negotiations. Previously, the negotiations between Shanghai Shenhua and Xi'an for the introduction of a midfielder from Shanghai Shenhua were overturned within 24 hours of the initial agreement, and ultimately led to the announcement that the negotiations had failed. And Wang Ke's transfer negotiations between Shanghai Shenhua and Beijing Guoan were also full of ups and downs, with a deadlock, and finally succeeded under the compromise policies such as Beijing Guoan changing the negotiating person in charge. It is said that Shanghai Shenhua insists on ""leasing but not transferring"" at present, but Shanghai Shenhua has still offered preferential conditions to Wuhan in the transfer negotiations next year: if this loan is successful, Shanghai Shenhua is willing to note in the loan contract that Wuhan has the right of first refusal for Li Weifeng next year. It is said that for the transfer fee, Shanghai Shenhua will start to negotiate from 5 million yuan, and it is impossible to be the price of the previous half a year. This is normal, after all, next year is the transfer fee for a year. """
香港男子捡240万港元3个月无人认领将归拾金者南都讯记者王雅楠发自香港一个香港的哥捡到乘客落在车厢内的提包，打开一看里面竟有240万巨款。的哥连忙把钱交到湾仔警署。不料，三个月后去，失主没有找到，240万巨款也没人来认领！按香港民事法律，若警方在合理时间内未能找到物主，便会将财物归拾获者所有，这单新闻成为香港各大论坛的讨论热点。警方：翻查闭路电视未找到失主昨日，南都记者向香港警方核实此事，据警方介绍，今年5月底，一名男子向警方报案，称驾驶的士时发现一个手提包，内有大量现金。警员接报后，得知涉及大笔财物，于是马上通报上司，并详细记录了的士司机拾获现金的情况。警方初步点算，发现包内现金高达240万港元，袋中还有一些澳门某赌场有关的单据。香港警方称，接获的士司机报警后，曾积极追寻物主身份，包括翻查闭路电视，甚至向澳门赌场查询，但对方回复“近期未有接获职员表示失款。而翻查计算机记录，依然没发现有人曾报案有遗失240万元。在的哥向警方送交提包时，警方按照有关程序，在点收金额之后，向的士司机发了一张财物收据。按照香港警方惯例，若在指定期限内无人认领财物，而拾获者有意认领，警方便会通知拾获者前往警署领取财物。的哥原本以为“冒失鬼”丢失巨款，肯定会报警追钱的。在报案三个月后，这名的士司机打电话去警署，确认有无人前来认领。不料，竟被告知此案“仍在调查中”。此事在港引起很大反响，不少人对这笔钱的来历充满好奇，的士司机梁先生不信240万港元没人认领，他怀疑这笔钱的来历有问题。的哥热议：拾物常有，不够胆私藏按香港法例规定，以不法手段获取即属于犯法。因此，市民捡到财物，多交给警方处理。乘客坐的士，遗漏东西在车上时有发生。昨日，南都记者随机采访了几位香港的士司机，他们认为拾到巨款就像“中彩票”，不过不够胆私藏。“开车六年来，我也经常捡到东西，每次都交给警署，事后得知都有被失主找回，心里很踏实。”司机梁先生坦言，拾金不昧的行为从自身做起，这样香港才能形成好的氛围。东西丢了，谁都不开心。而的士司机李先生则笑言，自己曾经捡到一部iPhone4，交给警方后一直没找到失主，后来给家里的小孩在用。他说：“家里人都很意外，不过先交给警方调查，用起来也会安心很多。”有法可依找不到失主就归拾遗者此案件引发的讨论聚焦在“三个月后无人认领，可把财物交给拾遗者”的香港相关法律规定。立法会法律界议员涂谨申表示，处理拾获财物安排属民事法律，若警方在合理时间内未能找到物主，便会将财物归拾获者所有，一般以三个月为限，但若涉及贵重财物，超过三个月也可接受。警方在《警察通例》中也对处理拾获财物的程序有所规范，规定任何人如将拾获财物交给警署，应获发一张财物收据，收据正副本也须注明拾获者是否打算于指定限期过后认领财物。如果表示有此打算，警方须通知拾获者前往警署领取，负责的警员及拾获者也须在报告上签署核实。此外，根据香港法例，凡在机场、港铁范围及公共巴士拾获物品，即使交到警方而最后无人认领，失物也不会归拾获者所有，而是将物品交予机管局、港铁及巴士公司处理。(综合香港媒体报道)	王雅楠,梁先生,李先生,涂谨申	正向	"Hong Kong man finds HK$2.4 million in a bag left in the car by a passenger and returns it to the finder South China Morning Post reporter Wang Yanan reported from Hong Kong A Hong Kong taxi driver found a bag left in the car by a passenger and opened it to find 2.4 million HK dollars. The taxi driver hurriedly handed the money over to the Wan Chai police station. To my surprise, three months later, the owner had not been found, and no one claimed the 2.4 million yuan! Under Hong Kong civil law, if the police fail to find the owner within a reasonable time, the property will belong to the finder, and this news has become a hot topic of discussion on Hong Kong's major forums. Police: Reviewing the closed-circuit television footage did not find the owner. Yesterday, Nanfang Daily reporters verified this matter with the Hong Kong police. According to the police, in late May this year, a man reported to the police that he found a handbag in the taxi he was driving, which contained a large amount of cash. Upon receiving the report, the police officer learned that it involved a large sum of money, and immediately reported to the superior and recorded in detail the taxi driver's finding of cash. The police made an initial count and found that there were as much as HK$2.4 million in cash in the bag, and some receipts from a casino in Macau in the pocket. The Hong Kong police said that they had actively traced the identity of the owner after receiving the taxi driver's report, including checking the closed-circuit television and even querying the Macao casino, but the other party replied that ""no staff had reported losing money recently."" And checking the computer records, no one reported the loss of 2.4 million yuan. When the taxi driver handed over the bag to the police, the police issued a receipt for the property according to the relevant procedures after counting the amount. According to the Hong Kong police convention, if no one claims the property within the specified period and the finder wishes to claim it, the police will notify the finder to go to the police station to collect the property. The driver originally thought that the ""careless person"" would report the police to chase the money if he lost a huge sum of money. Three months after the taxi driver reported the case, he called the police station to confirm whether anyone had claimed it. To my surprise, I was told that the case was still under investigation. This matter has caused a great response in Hong Kong, and many people are curious about the origin of this money. Mr. Leung, a taxi driver, does not believe that no one claims this 2.4 million Hong Kong dollars, and he suspects that there is something wrong with the origin of this money. Drivers' hot discussion: found items are common, but not daring to keep them. According to Hong Kong law, obtaining items illegally is a crime. Therefore, citizens tend to turn lost property over to the police. Passengers sometimes leave their belongings in a taxi. Yesterday, Nanrui reporters randomly interviewed several Hong Kong taxi drivers, who believed that finding a large sum of money was like ""winning the lottery"", but they were not brave enough to keep it privately. Over the six years of driving, I have also picked up many things and handed them over to the police station every time. I learned later that they were all returned to the owners, which made me feel very relieved. Driver Mr. Liang admitted that keeping lost property is a good atmosphere that should start from oneself, so that Hong Kong can form a good atmosphere. It's no fun for anyone when something is lost. And Mr. Li, the taxi driver, joked that he once found an iPhone 4, which he handed over to the police, but was unable to find the owner, and later used it for his children at home. He said, ""Everyone at home was surprised, but it's better to hand it over to the police for investigation first, and it will be much more reassuring to use."" If there is no owner after three months, the lost property will be given to the finder. The discussion on this case focuses on the relevant Hong Kong laws that allow the finder to keep the lost property. Legislative Council legal sector member Tuk Kam-shing said that the arrangements for handling lost property are civil laws. If the police are unable to find the owner within a reasonable time, the property will be returned to the finder. Generally, three months are allowed, but if it involves valuable property, it can also be accepted beyond three months. The Police also set out the procedures for handling found property in the Police General Orders, and stipulate that anyone who hands found property to a police station shall be issued a receipt for the property, and both the original and copy of the receipt shall also indicate whether the finder intends to claim the property after the designated period. If it is intended to do so, the police must notify the finder to go to the police station to claim it, and the responsible police officer and the finder must sign to confirm on the report. In addition, according to Hong Kong law, if items are found at the airport, MTR, or public buses, even if they are handed over to the police and no one claims them, the lost items do not belong to the finder, but are handled by the Airport Authority, MTR, and bus companies.

荷兰功勋老将登百场殿堂15年辉煌若夺世界杯将完美新浪体育讯　与丹麦队的比赛，打响了荷兰队本届世界杯的第一枪。这场比赛对于老队长范布隆霍克斯特来说，更是具有纪念意义的一场比赛，这是范布隆霍克斯特代表荷兰队的第100场正式比赛。“梦幻郁金香”的荷兰队中，35岁的老队长范布隆克霍斯特算不上星光璀璨，但他绝对是重大赛事中阅历最为丰富的队员，曾参加过两届世界杯和两届欧洲杯的他，已然代表国家队征战过百场，他是荷兰队左路密不透风的铁闸。家有一老如有一宝，虽然已达到了35岁的高龄，但本场比赛范布隆克霍斯在攻防两端皆有突出贡献，其充沛的体能和状态的保持就连主教练范马尔维克都为之惊叹：“吉奥永远不是最引人注目的，但他却是球队最关键的一环。”范布隆克霍斯特出道于荷兰国内俱乐部费耶诺德，并先后辗转于格拉斯哥流浪者、阿森纳和巴塞罗那。可以说，范布隆克霍斯特是幸运的，17年间，他几乎拿遍了俱乐部的所有荣誉。这其中包括了代表流浪者队在98-99和99-00两个赛季的苏超两连冠；转会阿森纳之后，又率队捧起了01-02赛季的英超冠军，之后两年，范布隆克霍斯特又两度捧起足总杯冠军；接下来他在职业生涯的颠峰段转会到了巴塞罗那，分别于04-05赛季和05-06赛季蝉联西甲两连冠，2006年更是站到了欧洲之颠，代表巴萨加冕欧冠冠军。但范布隆克霍斯特同时又是不幸的，在“无冕之王”的荷兰国家队，他始终未能一尝世界冠军或者欧洲冠军的滋味，而本届南非世界杯，将是范布隆克霍斯特最后的机会。自1996年首次身披国家队的橙色战袍以来，范布隆克霍斯15年间已经为荷兰国家队出场了100场，贡献了5粒进球。然而英雄总有谢幕时，本届世界杯后，范布隆克霍斯亦将正式退出国家队：“这次离开只是我生命中一段篇章的结束，但是我并不希望结束费耶诺德的时光，在我的职业生涯即将结束的时候，希望能够在南非绽放最后的光芒，而我也将会竭尽所能与队友和教练合作，力争将大力神杯带回荷兰。那才是一个完美的结局！”(陈驰)	范布隆霍克斯特,范布隆克霍斯,范布隆克霍斯特,范马尔维克,陈驰	正向	"The Dutch veteran hero entered the hall of fame for 150 games, and if he won the World Cup, it would be perfect. Sina Sports News  The match against Denmark was the first shot of the Dutch team in this World Cup. This match was even more memorable for the veteran captain, Van Bronckhorst, who made his 100th official appearance for the Netherlands. Among the Dutch team of ""Dream Tulip"", Van Bronckhorst, the 35-year-old veteran captain, is not dazzling, but he is definitely the most experienced player in major events. He has participated in two World Cups and two European Cups, and he has already represented the national team in more than 100 matches. He is the iron wall of the Dutch team's left flank. An old hand is as good as a treasure, though Van Bronckhorst has reached the age of 35, he still made outstanding contributions in both attack and defense in this match. His abundant energy and good physical condition even surprised the head coach, Frank de Boer: ""Gio is never the most eye-catching, but he is the most important link in the team."" Van Bronckhorst started his career at Feyenoord, a club in the Netherlands, and then played for Glasgow Rangers, Arsenal, and Barcelona. One could say that Van Bronckhorst was lucky, as he won almost all club honors in 17 years. This includes two consecutive championships of the Scottish Premier League in the 98-99 and 99-00 seasons as a representative of the Stray Dog team; after transferring to Arsenal, he led the team to win the Premier League championship in the 01-02 season, and then won the FA Cup championship twice in the following two years; in the peak of his career, he transferred to Barcelona, and won the La Liga championship for two consecutive seasons in the 04-05 and 05-06 seasons, and in 2006, he stood at the pinnacle of Europe, representing Barcelona to win the UEFA Champions League. But Van Bronckhorst was also unlucky, as the “uncrowned king” of the Dutch national team, he had never tasted the World Cup or European Cup, and this year’s South Africa World Cup will be Van Bronckhorst’s last chance. Since first wearing the orange jersey of the national team in 1996, Van Bronckhorst has made 100 appearances for the Netherlands national team and scored 5 goals in 15 years. But heroes must eventually bow out, and after this World Cup, Van Bronckhorst will officially retire from the national team: ""This departure is the end of a chapter in my life, but I do not want to end my time at Feyenoord. At the end of my career, I hope to shine in South Africa, and I will do my best to work with my teammates and coaches to bring the World Cup back to the Netherlands. That was a perfect ending!

掌握三大点雅思听力9分其实并不难5月22日一早，我便守在电脑前，注视着雅思查分网站，不断的刷屏，期待着能早些看到自己5月9号雅思考试的成绩。8时左右，网站上终于出现了“总分：7.5听力：9阅读：8.5写作：6口语：7”的信息。一颗悬着的心最终落地。这样的成绩，虽然与自己的预期目标有一定的差距，但也颇感欣慰。回首自己的雅思的备考的过程，一路走来的并不平坦。这里，主要想和大家分享一下自己有关雅思考试和英语学习的经验，希望对大家有所帮助，使大家少走弯路。从整体来说，雅思考试属于一种能力水平测试，其考察的是考生对英语使用能力，也就是一个完善的语言结构。语言的价值体现主要在其传达和交换信息的能力，表现在日常生活中不外乎是“听/说/读/写”四项基本功，所以要在雅思考试中取得理想的成绩，就必须全面提高听说读写的能力，四项基本能力不可偏废其一。而这又从另外一个侧面反映了雅思考试的科学性与严谨性的同时，保证了雅思考试的信度与效度。具体来说，雅思考试所考察的四项基本能力可以分为两个大类，一个是语言输入类，包括听力与阅读；另外一个就是语言输出类，包括口语和写作。两种不同的能力大类，决定了其准备过程会有一定的差别。语言输入类，也就是听力和阅读部分，其考试的本质就是要求考生对给出的信息进行再加工，用另外的一种表达而已，各种题型大都有技巧可循，而新航道的老师早已对这类的技巧进行了整理与归纳，使每一个考生都能轻松掌握，灵活应对考试。就听力而言，正如杜小鹏老师所言：“雅思考试的听力部分考查的是三个方面：题型、节奏和词汇。三项同时同步考察，可能哪一项都不像其他几门那么难，但要求速度快，节奏感要强”。掌握了这三点，雅思考试的听力问题便可迎刃而解。而听力老师优雅的气质也使全班人为之倾倒，使掌握知识的过程事半功倍。而至于阅读而言，阅读老师总结出了雅思阅读的四大要素：第一，词汇量；第二，对语法题型的理解；第三，要对考试题型的了解并有很好的解题技巧；第四，有广泛的阅读量。相信考生如果认真按照这四点进行充分的准备的话，一个优秀的雅思成绩便指日可待。另外要补充的是阅读老师的风趣幽默的课堂风格，不去感受一下，真的会遗憾的。语言输出类，也就是口语和写作部分，其本质便是要求考生应用自身储备的知识，解决多样化的问题。我国的考生大都对这两项考试“心怀敬畏”。其实老师们也早已为考生们准备了各种有效的应对措施。比如口语老师所教授的口语课程，充分考虑了雅思口语考试中可能遇到的各种情况，并一一加以分解评述，使口语考试的每一部分，每一个话题都能被考生充分理解，并完美的掌握。而她激情澎湃的演说，也极大的鼓舞了同学们的信心。至于写作课，写作老师将写作考试的全部题型一一分解，详细阐述，并根据语言学习的自然规律，应用“模写”的方法使学生们能够在短暂的时间里快速提高自己的英语写作水平。需要强调的一点是，雅思考试中，无论是语言输入类的能力考察和语言输出类的能力考察都是统一于考察英语能力这一个框架之内，都是相互联系，相互促进的，绝不能使之对立起来。最后，要与大家分享的便是一条校训：“IwillpersistuntilIsucceed”。正是这句新航道的校训，伴随着我走过了近100个准备雅思考试的日日夜夜。也祝愿各位仍在为雅思奋斗的同学们考试成功！更多信息请访问：新浪雅思频道雅思论坛雅思博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。	杜小鹏	正向	"Mastering three key points, getting a 9 in IELTS listening is not difficult. On the morning of May 22, I was in front of the computer, watching the IELTS score website, refreshing the screen over and over again, hoping to see the results of my IELTS test on May 9 as soon as possible. Around 8 o'clock, the website finally showed the information ""Total score: 7.5 Listening: 9 Reading: 8.5 Writing: 6 Speaking: 7"". A heart that hung in the air finally landed. Such results, although they fall short of one's expectations, are still quite gratifying. Looking back at the preparation process for the IELTS, the journey has not been smooth. Here, I mainly want to share my experience of the IELTS test and English learning with you, hoping to be of help to you and help you avoid taking the wrong path. Overall, the IELTS test is a test of ability level, which tests the examinees' ability to use English, that is, a complete language structure. The value of language is reflected in its ability to convey and exchange information, which is mainly manifested in the four basic skills of ""listening/speaking/reading/writing"" in daily life. Therefore, in order to achieve ideal results in the IELTS test, it is necessary to comprehensively improve the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, and none of the four basic skills can be neglected. And this also reflects the scientific and rigorous nature of the IELTS test from another perspective, while ensuring the reliability and validity of the IELTS test. Specifically, the four basic abilities tested in the IELTS examination can be divided into two major categories, one of which is the language input category, including listening and reading, and the other is the language output category, including speaking and writing. Two different categories of abilities determine that the preparation process will be somewhat different. The language input section, which includes listening and reading, essentially requires candidates to reprocess the given information and express it in another way. There are techniques for various question types, and New航道 teachers have already organized and summarized these techniques, so that every candidate can easily master them and flexibly respond to the exam. In terms of listening, as Mr. Du Xiaopeng said, ""The listening part of the IELTS test examines three aspects: question type, rhythm, and vocabulary."" Three at the same time, at the same time, may not be as difficult as the other subjects, but it requires speed and a strong sense of rhythm. Master these three points, and the listening problems of the IELTS exam will be solved effortlessly. And the graceful demeanor of the listening teacher also makes the whole class fall in love, making the process of acquiring knowledge twice as effective. As for reading, the teacher summarized the four elements of IELTS reading: first, vocabulary; second, understanding of grammar question types; third, understanding of the question types of the exam and having good solving skills; fourth, having a wide range of reading. If candidates prepare thoroughly according to these four points, an excellent IELTS score is just around the corner. Another thing to add is that you will really regret it if you don't experience the humorous and witty teaching style of the teacher. The language output section, which includes speaking and writing, essentially requires candidates to apply their knowledge to solve a variety of problems. Most Chinese candidates are awed by these two exams. In fact, teachers have also prepared various effective countermeasures for candidates long ago. For example, the speaking courses taught by the spoken language teachers fully consider all kinds of situations that may be encountered in the IELTS speaking test, and analyze and comment on them one by one, so that every part of the speaking test and every topic can be fully understood and perfectly mastered by the examinees. And her passionate speech greatly boosted her classmates' confidence. As for the writing class, the writing teacher will break down all the types of writing tests, explain them in detail, and apply the ""imitation"" method according to the natural laws of language learning, so that students can quickly improve their English writing level in a short time. It is worth emphasizing that in the IELTS test, the ability assessment of language input and the ability assessment of language output are all within the framework of assessing English ability, and they are interrelated and mutually promoting. They should not be put in opposition to each other. Finally, the motto to be shared is: ""I will persist until I succeed"". It was this new airway's motto that accompanied me through nearly 100 days and nights of preparation for the IELTS exam.

杨洁篪：中国帮助非洲修建2200公里铁路十一届全国人大四次会议于3月7日上午10时在人民大会堂三楼金色大厅举行记者会，外交部部长杨洁篪就外交政策和对外关系问题答记者问。[杨洁篪]我们国家的发展我想为我们同其他国家的合作创造了更大的空间。这些年，我们同非洲国家进行了很多的合作。例如帮助他们加强基础设施的建设，已经帮助他们修建了2200多公里的铁路，3400公里左右的公路，这就像人一样，血脉畅通。这些国家就增强了可持续发展的能力，我们会进一步加强同各国的互利合作，来拉紧我们之间的利益纽带。我们也在努力尝试同发达国家一起来帮助第三国，特别是发展中国家。当然，这种三边的合作或者是四边、五边的合作必须要首先得到驻在国的同意和支持。	杨洁篪	正向	Yang Jiechi: China has helped to build 2,200 kilometers of railway in Africa. The 11th National People's Congress of the Fourth Session was held at 10:00 a.m. on March 7 in the Golden Hall on the third floor of the Great Hall of the People. Yang Jiechi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, answered questions from the press on foreign policy and foreign relations. [Yang Jiechi] I think the development of our country has created a larger space for cooperation with other countries. In recent years, we have carried out a lot of cooperation with African countries. For example, helping them to strengthen the construction of infrastructure, and helping them to build more than 2,200 kilometers of railways and about 3,400 kilometers of highways, which is like the blood vessels of a person, flowing smoothly. These countries have enhanced their capacity for sustainable development, and we will further strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries to tighten the interests ties between us. We are also making efforts to help third countries, especially developing countries, together with the developed countries. Of course, such trilateral cooperation, or quadrilateral, pentagonal cooperation, must first obtain the consent and support of the host country.

研究称胸部丰满女性患2型糖尿病几率高人体的某些常见特征可能是疾病的前兆。近日，美国《预防》杂志列出10个常见的身体信号，帮你预测自己的健康状况。1。手指长度。英国学者研究发现，食指比无名指短的女性，膝关节炎的发病率是普通人的2倍。有此特征的男性，雌激素水平较低，也易患上关节炎。预防方法：锻炼膝盖部位的肌肉。静坐时，双腿平行于地面做10次伸展运动，每次保持5—10秒。2。身高。美国国家科学院的研究发现，身高超过1.58米的女性，活到100岁的几率不大。预防方法：生活规律，戒烟限酒，少吃肉。3。腿长。英国学者研究发现，腿长在0.5—0.7米之间的人，血液里导致肝脏疾病的酶含量比较高。预防方法：避免暴露在化学物质下，在有污染的场合工作要戴上面具和手套；严格控制饮酒量。4。嗅觉。老人如不能清晰分辨香蕉、肉桂、柠檬等食物的气味，4年内患帕金森症的几率提高5倍。预防方法：多补充富含欧米伽-3的鱼类食品。5。胳膊长度。美国塔夫斯大学研究发现，胳膊短的女性患老年痴呆的几率是胳膊长女性的1.5倍。预防方法：培养画画等爱好，可将老年痴呆的发病几率降低2.5倍。6。耳垂折痕。耳垂部位有皱纹的人，容易患心脑血管疾病。双耳都有折痕，患病风险达77%。预防方法：瘦身，降低血压和胆固醇水平。7。肚腩。《神经学》期刊近日研究发现，有大肚腩的中年人，70岁时患痴呆的风险高3.6倍。预防方法：多吃橄榄油、坚果和黑巧克力，能消除内脏脂肪堆积。8。胸部大小。《加拿大医学协会》刊登一项长达10年的研究发现，穿D罩杯的年轻妇女比穿A罩杯的，患2型糖尿病的几率增加1.5倍。预防方法：增加运动强度。在跑步机上做6次30秒快跑运动的人，身体代谢血糖的能力高25%。9。小腿长度。法国学者研究发现，小腿长度低于0.33米的妇女容易出现颈动脉斑块，增加中风风险。预防方法：多喝绿茶。每天喝5杯绿茶的人，心脑血管病的发病率最低。10。血型。哈佛大学医学院研究发现，A、B、AB型血的人比O型血的人患胰腺癌的机会高44%。预防方法：多吃低脂奶制品或鱼类，补充维生素D。每天摄入300国际单位维生素D的人，胰腺癌的发病率降低44%。▲(冯国川)	冯国川	正向	The study found that women with ample bosoms are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and some common physical features of the human body may be a harbinger of the disease. Recently, the American magazine Prevention listed 10 common physical signals to help you predict your health condition. 1. Finger length. British scholars have found that women with shorter ring fingers than index fingers have twice the incidence of knee osteoarthritis as ordinary people. Males with this feature have lower levels of estrogen and are also more prone to developing arthritis. Prevention: exercise the muscles in the knee area. Sit with your legs parallel to the ground and extend 10 times, holding each for 5-10 seconds. 2. Height. The research of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States found that women taller than 1.58 meters have a small chance of living to 100. Preventive measures: regular life, quit smoking and limit alcohol, eat less meat. 3. Long legs. British scholars have found that people with leg lengths between 0.5 and 0.7 meters have higher levels of enzymes in their blood that cause liver disease. Preventive measures: avoid exposure to chemicals, wear masks and gloves when working in contaminated areas, and strictly control alcohol consumption. 4. Olfaction. If elderly people cannot clearly distinguish the smell of food such as bananas, cinnamon, and lemons, their risk of developing Parkinson's disease within four years will increase by 5 times. Prevention: Consume more fish rich in omega-3. 5. Arm length. A study by Tufts University in the United States found that women with short arms are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease than women with long arms. Prevention: Cultivating hobbies such as painting can reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease by 2.5 times. 6. Earlobe crease. People with wrinkles on their earlobes are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Both ears have creases, with a 77% risk of disease. Preventive measures: weight loss, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 7. Belly. A recent study in the journal Neurology found that middle-aged people with a large belly have 3.6 times the risk of developing dementia at the age of 70. Prevention: Eating more olive oil, nuts, and dark chocolate can eliminate visceral fat accumulation. 8. Size of the chest. The Canadian Medical Association Journal published a study that found that young women who wear D-cup bras have 1.5 times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who wear A-cup bras over a 10-year period. Prevention: Increase exercise intensity. Those who do 6 sprints of 30 seconds on the treadmill have 25% higher ability to metabolize blood glucose. 9. Length of the lower leg. French scholars have found that women with a tibia length of less than 0.33 meters are more likely to develop carotid plaques and increase the risk of stroke. Prevention: drink more green tea. People who drink 5 cups of green tea every day have the lowest incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. 10. Blood type. Harvard Medical School research found that people with blood types A, B, and AB have a 44% higher chance of developing pancreatic cancer than people with blood type O. Prevention: eat more low-fat dairy products or fish, and take vitamin D. People who consume 300 international units of vitamin D daily have a 44% lower incidence of pancreatic cancer. ▲(Guo Chuan Feng)

Online report (Reporter Wang Zhiming): On October 31, the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs launched a black campaign called ""Morava"" across the country, arresting more than 500 black gang members and seizing large quantities of drugs, weapons, ammunition, counterfeit money, and stolen cars. Dacic, the minister of the interior, told the press after the operation that more than 2,000 interior ministry police had been involved, and that 600 locations across the country had been raided. The main targets of the raids were those who sold drugs to children in schools, cafes, and discotheques. Dacic said that during the operation, 5 kg of marijuana and some heroin, as well as 57 weapons of various types, more than 20 stolen cars, and over 1.5 million dollars in counterfeit money were seized. In addition, six fugitive suspects were also arrested. Dacic said that the operation received strong support from the judiciary in all regions. Serbia is actively seeking to join the EU. In order to meet the requirements of the EU, Serbia must combat various criminal forces and improve social security while revising and perfecting various laws. In particular, the EU has committed to abolishing the visa regime for citizens of Serbia visiting EU countries at the beginning of next year, which gives a specific meaning to the anti-gang operations of the Serbian Ministry of the Interior across the country."

阿里扎巴蒂尔一点完败给船长冠军球队需要这种人新浪体育讯　北京时间1月13日消息，火箭队今日做客夏洛特，迎战有强队克星之称的山猫队。火箭队在上半场一直保持两位数的领先优势，但在第三节开始后被对手掌控局面，并最终以94比102被对手逆转。火箭队这一场的失利当然和船长斯蒂芬-杰克逊的出色表现有关，后者打出职业生涯的最佳表现，拿下43分8个篮板，创出个人职业生涯单场得分的新高。拥有巴蒂尔和阿里扎两个一等一的防守球员，火箭队却还让斯蒂芬-杰克逊一个人羞辱了整个火箭队，毫无疑问，这一场的失利，他们要负上最大的责任。阿里扎全场比赛16投7中，三分球6投2中，罚球6中3，拿下19分6个篮板以及4次助攻。巴蒂尔全场比赛9投3中，三分球7中2，拿下10分和3个篮板。两人的得分相加比斯蒂芬-杰克逊还差了14分，但真正的差距并不是这14分，而是气质上的差别。而这一场的失利也再度证明，这一支火箭队仍然缺乏一个真正的领头羊。斯蒂芬-杰克逊比较巴蒂尔和阿里扎，身上多了一种匪气，这是他和火箭队这两位小前锋最大的不同。从能力上说，斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许算不上联盟一流的小前锋，但是他够自信，够坚决，敢于做动作，极有魄力。在前三节，山猫队几乎都在靠他一个人在支撑。在手感不好的情况下，斯蒂芬-杰克逊会选择用突破来制造杀伤。请注意，他的突破和阿里扎的突破不同在于，当前方有对手干扰的时候，杰克逊会直挺挺的迎上去，来拼得罚球机会，全场比赛他11次走上罚球线，10次罚中。而阿里扎的动作则更多的是躲闪，这倒不是说阿里扎偏软，但是你不能不说，这的确是一种缺乏自信的表现。杰克逊的这种匪气，在两队的相持阶段成为了左右胜负的关键。在第四节的相持时刻，火箭队将进攻机会交给了阿里扎来单打，而在山猫队方面，执行进攻任务的则是杰克逊。从第四节还剩下10分钟开始，在之后的6次进攻中，斯蒂芬-杰克逊5次得分，唯一的一次失败还是被巴蒂尔制造了进攻犯规，但很快杰克逊就逼迫巴蒂尔犯规，走上罚球线找回了面子。相反，火箭队方面，阿里扎就完全没有斯蒂芬-杰克逊的风范。他在持球进攻中很犹豫，突破的时候极为勉强，想背身单打，但显然又有些不知所措。进攻中的连续失败也影响了阿里扎的防守表现，一次无谓的干扰球还送给了对手两分。短短的5分钟内，火箭队被山猫队打了一个13比2，从领先5分变成了落后6分，并再也没有追过来。阿里扎的短板，在这一段时间内被暴露无遗。他缺乏一个强硬的心，缺乏那种必胜的信念。火箭队总经理莫雷曾经表示，期望阿里扎能够完成一种飞跃，一种从角色球员到一线球星的飞跃，但现在来看，这不仅仅是他的技术没有准备好，他的心理也没有准备好。斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许从能力上不是一个顶级球星，但是他对于胜利的那种渴望，那种信念，那种决心，的确是具备了赢家的气质。为什么当年在勇士，他能够带领球队制造黑八奇迹淘汰小牛，这也是关键原因。现在的这支火箭队就缺少这种球员，阿里扎不是，巴蒂尔不是，布鲁克斯也不是，斯科拉略有这样的气质，但他的身体条件、打法风格限制了他的作用。洛瑞也具备一定这样的气质，但和斯科拉一样，身体条件和技术限制了他的影响力。火箭队有太多的好孩子，他们需要一个像阿泰斯特像斯蒂芬-杰克逊这样有匪气特质的球员来激发这支球队的活力。颇为遗憾的是，在转会山猫之前，斯蒂芬-杰克逊曾经示好火箭愿意加盟，但火箭队错过了这样的机会。一支冠军球队中，不会只有好孩子，火箭队现在就缺少这么样的一个人。(大脸猫)新浪体育讯　北京时间1月13日消息，火箭队今日做客夏洛特，迎战有强队克星之称的山猫队。火箭队在上半场一直保持两位数的领先优势，但在第三节开始后被对手掌控局面，并最终以94比102被对手逆转。火箭队这一场的失利当然和船长斯蒂芬-杰克逊的出色表现有关，后者打出职业生涯的最佳表现，拿下43分8个篮板，创出个人职业生涯单场得分的新高。拥有巴蒂尔和阿里扎两个一等一的防守球员，火箭队却还让斯蒂芬-杰克逊一个人羞辱了整个火箭队，毫无疑问，这一场的失利，他们要负上最大的责任。阿里扎全场比赛16投7中，三分球6投2中，罚球6中3，拿下19分6个篮板以及4次助攻。巴蒂尔全场比赛9投3中，三分球7中2，拿下10分和3个篮板。两人的得分相加比斯蒂芬-杰克逊还差了14分，但真正的差距并不是这14分，而是气质上的差别。而这一场的失利也再度证明，这一支火箭队仍然缺乏一个真正的领头羊。斯蒂芬-杰克逊比较巴蒂尔和阿里扎，身上多了一种匪气，这是他和火箭队这两位小前锋最大的不同。从能力上说，斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许算不上联盟一流的小前锋，但是他够自信，够坚决，敢于做动作，极有魄力。在前三节，山猫队几乎都在靠他一个人在支撑。在手感不好的情况下，斯蒂芬-杰克逊会选择用突破来制造杀伤。请注意，他的突破和阿里扎的突破不同在于，当前方有对手干扰的时候，杰克逊会直挺挺的迎上去，来拼得罚球机会，全场比赛他11次走上罚球线，10次罚中。而阿里扎的动作则更多的是躲闪，这倒不是说阿里扎偏软，但是你不能不说，这的确是一种缺乏自信的表现。杰克逊的这种匪气，在两队的相持阶段成为了左右胜负的关键。在第四节的相持时刻，火箭队将进攻机会交给了阿里扎来单打，而在山猫队方面，执行进攻任务的则是杰克逊。从第四节还剩下10分钟开始，在之后的6次进攻中，斯蒂芬-杰克逊5次得分，唯一的一次失败还是被巴蒂尔制造了进攻犯规，但很快杰克逊就逼迫巴蒂尔犯规，走上罚球线找回了面子。相反，火箭队方面，阿里扎就完全没有斯蒂芬-杰克逊的风范。他在持球进攻中很犹豫，突破的时候极为勉强，想背身单打，但显然又有些不知所措。进攻中的连续失败也影响了阿里扎的防守表现，一次无谓的干扰球还送给了对手两分。短短的5分钟内，火箭队被山猫队打了一个13比2，从领先5分变成了落后6分，并再也没有追过来。阿里扎的短板，在这一段时间内被暴露无遗。他缺乏一个强硬的心，缺乏那种必胜的信念。火箭队总经理莫雷曾经表示，期望阿里扎能够完成一种飞跃，一种从角色球员到一线球星的飞跃，但现在来看，这不仅仅是他的技术没有准备好，他的心理也没有准备好。斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许从能力上不是一个顶级球星，但是他对于胜利的那种渴望，那种信念，那种决心，的确是具备了赢家的气质。为什么当年在勇士，他能够带领球队制造黑八奇迹淘汰小牛，这也是关键原因。现在的这支火箭队就缺少这种球员，阿里扎不是，巴蒂尔不是，布鲁克斯也不是，斯科拉略有这样的气质，但他的身体条件、打法风格限制了他的作用。洛瑞也具备一定这样的气质，但和斯科拉一样，身体条件和技术限制了他的影响力。火箭队有太多的好孩子，他们需要一个像阿泰斯特像斯蒂芬-杰克逊这样有匪气特质的球员来激发这支球队的活力。颇为遗憾的是，在转会山猫之前，斯蒂芬-杰克逊曾经示好火箭愿意加盟，但火箭队错过了这样的机会。一支冠军球队中，不会只有好孩子，火箭队现在就缺少这么样的一个人。(大脸猫)	阿里扎,巴蒂尔,船长,克星,斯蒂芬-杰克逊,杰克逊,莫雷,布鲁克斯,斯科拉,洛瑞,阿泰斯特	负向	Ariza was completely defeated by the captain's champion team, and such people are needed. Rockets arrived in Charlotte today to play against the Bobcats, who are known as the strong team's bane. The Rockets maintained a double-digit lead throughout the first half, but were taken over by their opponents in the third quarter and ultimately lost to them 94-102. Of course, the Rockets' loss this time is related to the excellent performance of the captain Stephen Jackson, who has played the best game of his career, scoring 43 points and 8 rebounds, and setting a new record for the highest single-game score in his career. With Battier and Ariza, two top-notch defenders, on the team, the Rockets still let Stephen Jackson humiliate the entire Rockets team alone, and it is beyond doubt that he bears the greatest responsibility for the loss in this game. Ariza scored 19 points, grabbed 6 rebounds and made 4 assists in the whole game, shooting 7 of 16, 2 of 6 from three-point line and 3 of 6 from the free-throw line. Battier scored 10 points and grabbed 3 rebounds in 39 minutes, shooting 30% from the field and 28.6% from three-point range. The combined score of the two players was 14 points lower than Stephen Jackson, but the real difference was not these 14 points, but the difference in temperament. And this defeat once again proves that this Rockets team still lacks a true leader. Stephen Jackson compares Battier and Ariza, with an extra bit of thug, which is the biggest difference between the two and the Rockets' small forwards. Stephen Jackson may not be a top small forward in the league in terms of ability, but he is confident, determined, dares to make moves, and is very bold. In the first three quarters, the Bobcats were almost relying on him alone. When手感 is not good, Stephen Jackson would choose to use penetration to create damage. Note that Jackson's breakthrough is different from Ariza's, as he will go straight to the opponent when there is an opponent in front of him to get a free throw opportunity. In the whole game, he went to the free throw line 11 times and made 10 of them. And Ariza's movements were more about dodging, which is not to say that Ariza is soft, but you can't help but say that this is indeed a sign of a lack of confidence. Jackson's thug nature became the key to winning or losing during the stalemate between the two teams. During the stalemate in the fourth quarter, the Rockets passed the offensive opportunity to Ariza for a one-on-one, while the Hornets passed the ball to Jackson to execute the offense. Starting from the 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter, in the following 6 offensive plays, Stephen Jackson scored 5 times, and the only failure was when Battier committed an offensive foul, but Jackson soon forced Battier to foul and went to the free throw line to regain his face. On the contrary, Ariza has none of Stephen Jackson’s style on the Rockets. He was hesitant with the ball in his hands, forcing his way through, wanting to go to his back to single-handedly play, but it was obvious that he was at a loss. Consecutive failures in the offensive game also affected Ariza's defensive performance, and an unnecessary interference shot gave the opponent two points. In just 5 minutes, the Rockets were outscored by the Bobcats 13-2, going from a 5-point lead to a 6-point deficit, and never recovered. Ariza's weakness has been fully exposed in this period. He lacks a strong heart and the belief in victory. Morey, the Rockets' general manager, once said that he expected Ariza to make a leap, from a role player to a first-line star, but now it seems that not only is his technique not ready, but his psychology is also not ready. Stephen Jackson may not be a top-tier star in terms of ability, but his yearning for victory, belief, and determination certainly have the temperament of a winner. Why he could lead the team to create the miracle of Black Eight and eliminate the Mavericks in the Warriors, this is also a key reason. The current Rockets are short of such players,阿里扎 is not, Barea is not, Brooks is not, Skora has such temperament, but his physical condition and playing style limit his role. Loroy also has such temperament, but like Skora, his physical condition and technical limitations restrict his influence. The Rockets have too many good kids and they need a player with the attitude of Artest or Stephen Jackson to invigorate the team. It was a pity that Stephen Jackson had once expressed his willingness to join the Rockets before he transferred to the Bobcats, but the Rockets missed such an opportunity. There won't be only good boys in a champion team, and the Rockets are now missing such a person.

邢佳栋热播剧角色盘点有刚毅有颠覆(组图)新浪娱乐讯《士兵突击》热播后，“伍六一”的扮演者邢佳栋被观众所熟识。几年过去了，邢佳栋在数部热播剧中都有上佳的表现，他的代名词开始多了起来，“师座”、“处座”、“指挥长”、“向所”等等。告别2010年，让我们一起来回顾一下邢佳栋带给你的美好记忆。最刚毅——《士兵突击》伍六一《士兵突击》的热播，火了一个团队，“不抛弃不放弃”这六个字刻在了人们的心中，而那个叫“伍六一”的兵也刻在了我们心里。邢佳栋赋予伍六一刚毅的灵魂，伍六一赋予邢佳栋闪耀的光环。人活一世，很难不遇到什么难办的事情，总是抱怨，为什么是我，总是犹豫，我该如何。我想，伍六一心里也不那么踏实，他知道留在部队，做个司务长，每人每天四千大卡热量也能混一辈子，跟他的戎装他的梦在一起，不离不弃。可是，伍六一放下了，他说，他选择离开。伍六一从不抱怨，他对任何人任何事没有一句怨言，他走他自己的路。再艰难，再痛苦，再蹉跎，再不易，他是伍六一，他就能坚强地走下去。最真诚——《军歌嘹亮》高权《军歌嘹亮》里的高权，告诉我什么是忠诚，什么是坚定。我们年少轻狂的时候，会为了一点小事铸下大错，如果没有扑住高权的战友，高权恐怕已经越过边境线，只是为了一张前女友的照片。也许对他来说那不仅仅是一张照片，还有他逝去的年华和初恋。邢佳栋的眼神如孩子般清澈，你能透过角色看到他的真诚，他的用心。历练成长后的高权，少年英才，验证了虎父无犬子的古语，他站在高大山面前，无愧于司令的儿子，他牺牲在界碑前，无愧于是中国的军人。高权用他的生命告诉我们，任何事情都不能成为犯错的借口，有些事情，不能做就是不能做，死也不能做，这个道理，高权懂得了。我们在泪落下的一刻，也开始懂得了。最宽容——《雪琉璃》向菩明《雪琉璃》播出的时候，我随着观看该剧的众人吼了一声，邢佳栋好美貌啊。好吧，向菩明真的就是得用美貌来形容，年轻，帅气，俊朗，玉树临风，倜傥但不风流。邢佳栋在选择角色的时候，总能将其人物的光辉点放大，我们在向菩明身上学习他容人的气度，当然，向菩明的心细如尘和思维敏捷也是他的优点，但我更欣赏其宽容。李柯确实有些才华，但行事冲动，动辄就以下犯上，能容忍得了这样的干将，才是大家之风。宽容是很内在的一种气质，演不出来，得是发自内心的大气和从容，心里有，才能有所洋溢。最挣扎——《我的团长我的团》虞啸卿《我的团长我的团》中的虞啸卿，一个骨子里透着骄傲的人，宁折不弯，这话是高城对伍六一说的话，我看着虞啸卿，开始相信什么是前世今生。这样的虞啸卿，书香门第里慢火煨出来的才华横溢；这样的虞啸卿，战火纷飞中鲜血锻造的王者风范。宁可折，不可弯。宁可败，不可退。宁可死，不可悔。可，往往天意弄人，所有的一切要他一一去面对，如果能再任性一点，他就打过江去，如果能再懦弱一点，他就拼上这条命。选择放下，比选择拿起要难，这一点，我是在很久以后才明白。比起伍六一，我总觉得虞啸卿这样的角色更适合邢佳栋，他的光芒是一个小小的班副压不住的，一收再收，也只能说年轻，还未成气候。然而，三十几岁虞啸卿，需要怎样的风范、底蕴、胸怀、和刚毅，这些邢佳栋都赋予了虞啸卿，而只有骄傲，是虞啸卿赋予邢佳栋的。最完美——《雾里看花》郑岩《雾里看花》中的郑岩，可能是最贴近邢佳栋本人的角色，看起来内敛恬淡，内心却有那么一点小狂野，开切诺基的爷们，不会是个内心很柔软的人。然而，善良和正直是一样一样一样的，我不会觉得郑岩好得太过了，我相信生活中总会有这样的人，“你没有遇到，并不证明没有这样的人，这样的人我就见过。”这话，是邢佳栋自己说的。我觉得，郑岩是个会让人内心阳光的人，比不了那些励志型的人物，但是他总是告诉你，眼睛是黑的心是红的，不能看见了利益就眼睛是红的心是黑的。这话，对于在当今社会混日子的我们，极为重要，要知道什么是可为，什么是不可为，这样，我们得到的，往往不仅仅是心安。最颠覆——《烈火红岩》杜荫山邢佳栋演了太多好人，《烈火红岩》的开播后颠覆了左右观众对他的印象，那个笑容阴鸷，手段毒辣的国民党高官，竟然是邢佳栋演的。你再也看不到伍六一或者虞啸卿的影子，他也不再是邢佳栋，他就是还原到历史当中的一个魔化到疯狂的刽子手。杜荫山，政绩斐然，深受党国重用。他外国留学归来，饱读诗书，官运亨通前程似锦。邢佳栋说：“杜荫山是个军人，他有属于他自己的信仰，他首先不能认为自己是坏人，他得认为他做的所有事情都是对的。杜荫山最不喜欢的就是严刑逼供，他认为这是最没有技术含量的一种做法，如果能通过其他途径来解决问题，大可不必闹出人命。当然，共产党人意志的坚定往往超出杜荫山的想象，他都是在迫不得已的情况下才动刑的。”最给力——-《桥隆飙》桥隆飙也许每个男孩子在小的时候都会幻想自己有一天能够骑马打仗成为英雄，桥隆飙这个顶天立地有血有肉的大英雄，被邢佳栋演“活”了。桥隆飙的豪气盖天和忠肝义胆，让他成为了“最给力”的那个人，还有什么能比这样的英雄让你更过目不忘的。邢佳栋在拍《桥隆飙》的时候吃了很多苦，也受了些伤，但他从不提起这些事情，他的心思都在戏上都在人物上，别的那些事情似是与他无关。桥隆飙骑着白马叱咤风云，迷倒了太多太多人。有网友开玩笑说：“骑着白马的未必是白马王子，也有可能是唐僧。《桥隆飙》火了之后这句话得改改，骑着白马的未必是唐僧，也有可能是桥隆飙。”如果/文	邢佳栋,伍六一,高权,高大山,向菩明,菩明,李柯,虞啸卿,高城,郑岩,杜荫山,严刑,桥隆飙,唐僧	正向	"Xing Jiadong's popular TV series role review has刚毅 and颠覆(Disruption)(photo group). After the hit TV series ""Soldier's Strengh"", the actor Xing Jiadong, who played Wu Liuyi, was familiar to the audience. Several years later, Xing Jiadong had performed well in several popular TV series, and his nicknames began to increase, such as ""Teacher Commander"", ""Office Commander"", ""Commander"", and ""Xiangso"". Say goodbye to 2010 and let's look back at the beautiful memories Xing Jiadong brought to you. The most resolute - Wu Liu Yi of ""Soldier's Strenth"". The popularity of ""Soldier's Strenth"" has made a team famous, and the six words ""never give up"" have been engraved in people's hearts. And the soldier called ""Wu Liu Yi"" has also been engraved in our hearts. Xing Jiadong endows Wu Liuyi with a resolute soul, and Wu Liuyi endows Xing Jiadong with a dazzling halo. Life is short, it's hard not to encounter something difficult, always complaining, why me, always hesitating, how should I do. I think Wu Liuyi was not so at ease in his heart. He knew that staying in the army as a quartermaster, he could also live a long life with 4,000 calories of energy per person per day, with his uniform and his dream together, never leaving each other. But Wu Li yi put down his weapon and said that he chose to leave. Wu Liuyi never complained. He had no complaints about anything or anyone. He walked his own path. No matter how difficult, painful, wasted, or hard it is, he is Wu Lu Yi, and he can still walk on bravely. Most sincere - Gao Quan in ""The March of the Volunteers"" tells me what loyalty and firmness are in ""The March of the Volunteers"". When we were young and reckless, we would make a big mistake for a small matter. If we had not caught Gao Quan's comrade-in-arms, Gao Quan might have crossed the border for a photo of a former girlfriend. Perhaps for him, it was not just a picture, but also his lost youth and first love. Xing Jiadong's eyes are as clear as a child's, and you can see his sincerity and his dedication through the roles he plays. After the trials and growth, Gao Quan, the young talent, proved the old saying that a tiger father has no dog son. Standing in front of Daxianshan, he was not ashamed to be the son of the commander. He was killed in front of the boundary marker, and he was not ashamed to be a Chinese soldier. Gao Quan taught us with his life that nothing can be an excuse for making mistakes. Some things simply cannot be done, not even if one dies trying. Gao Quan understood this. We began to understand at the moment the tears fell. The most tolerant - When ""Snow Crystal"" was broadcast, I roared along with the audience watching the drama, Xing Jiadong is so handsome. Alright, Pu Ming is really something to describe with beauty, young, handsome, elegant, like a willow tree in the wind, elegant but not lewd. Xing Jiadong can always amplify the brilliance of his characters when choosing roles. We learn from Puming's magnanimity in accommodating others. Of course, Puming's meticulousness and quick thinking are also his strengths, but I admire his magnanimity more. Li Ke indeed has some talent, but he acts impulsively and often oversteps his bounds. It takes a great man to tolerate such a capable person. Tolerance is an inner temperament that cannot be put on. It must come from the heart. There must be something in the heart to overflow. Struggle the most - Yu Xiaqing in ""My Commander, My Regiment"" Yu Xiaqing, a proud person to the bone, who would rather break than bend. This is what Gao Cheng said to Wu Liu Yi. Looking at Yu Xiaqing, I began to believe in the concept of past life and present life. Such a Yu Xiaqing, a talent reared in the slow simmering of a scholarly family; such a Yu Xiaqing, a king's demeanor forged in the blood of war. Better to break than to bend. Better to lose than to retreat. Better to die than to repent. Yet, often fate plays tricks on people, and he has to face everything one by one. If he could be a little more indulgent, he would have crossed the river, and if he could be a little more cowardly, he would have risked his life. It is much harder to choose to let go than to choose to pick up, and I only realized this much later. I always feel that Xu Xiaqing is a better role for Xing Jiadong than Wu Liuyi. His brilliance is beyond the control of a small class monitor, and no matter how he is restrained, he can only say that he is young and has not yet formed a climate. However, what kind of demeanor, depth, and magnanimity, and firmness, did Yu Xiaoxing, in his thirties, need? All of these were given to Yu Xiaoxing by Xing Jiadong, while only pride was given to Xing Jiadong by Yu Xiaoxing. The most perfect - Zheng Yan in ""Foggy Flowers"" is the role that is closest to Xing Jiadong himself. He looks reserved and calm on the outside, but there is a little bit of wildness in his heart. A man who drives a Cherokee is not likely to be a person with a very soft heart. However, goodness and honesty are the same, I don't think Zheng Yan is too good, I believe there are such people in life, ""you have not met, does not prove that there are no such people, I have seen such people."" These words were said by Xing Jiadong himself. I think Zheng Yan is a person who can make people feel sunny in their hearts. He can't compare to those inspirational figures, but he always tells you that your eyes are black and your heart is red, and you can't see benefits and your eyes are red and your heart is black. This is of great importance to us who are just getting by in today's society. We should know what is doable and what is not, so that we can often gain more than just peace of mind. Most shocking - ""Red Rock in Flames"". Du Yingshan, Xing Jiadong, played too many good people. After the broadcast of ""Red Rock in Flames"", it overturned the audience's impression of him. That sinister smile and ruthless means of a Nationalist official turned out to be played by Xing Jiadong. You will never see Wu Liuyi or Yu Xiaoxing again, he is no longer Xing Jiadong, he is just a demonized mad executioner who has returned to history. Du Yingshan, with his outstanding performance, has been highly favored by the party and the country. He returned from studying abroad, well-read in literature, with a smooth official career and a bright future. Xing Jiadong said, ""Du Yingshan is a soldier, he has his own faith, he can't think of himself as a bad person, he must think that all the things he did were right."" Du Yingshan detested torture the most, and he believed that it was the least technologically advanced method. If other means could solve the problem, there was no need to cause a death. Of course, the Communists' determination often exceeded Du Yinshan's imagination, and he only resorted to torture when he had no choice. The most powerful - ""Qiao Longbiao"" Qiao Longbiao, perhaps every boy would imagine that he could ride a horse and fight and become a hero when he was young. Qiao Longbiao, this towering and flesh-and-blood great hero, was played by Xing Jiadong. Qiao Longbiao’s generosity and loyalty made him the most powerful person, what could be more unforgettable than such a hero. Xing Jiadong suffered a lot and got some injuries when filming Qiaolongbiao, but he never mentioned these things. His mind was always on the play and the characters, and those other things seemed to have nothing to do with him. Chang Longbiao, riding a white horse, galloped through the storm, leaving many people in awe. Some netizens jokingly said, ""The one riding a white horse is not necessarily a prince, it could also be Tang Seng."" After ""Qiao Longbiao"" became popular, this sentence should be changed.

印度地震死亡人数升至58人新华网新德里9月20日电(记者吴强)据印度当地媒体20日报道，18日印度东北部锡金邦发生的地震至今已造成58人死亡、几百人受伤。据报道，印度军队和营救人员在过去12小时内在锡金一些边远地区又找到了一些遇难者的尸体，锡金至今共有41人死于地震。由于救援人员还没有进入震中及其周围受灾最严重的地区，因此最终的伤亡人数还会继续上升。此外，附近的西孟加拉邦和比哈尔邦也有17人死于此次地震。到20日上午，几千名印度军人仍然冒着泥石流随时发生的危险继续打通进入锡金各边远地区的公路。由于桥梁、公路在地震中受损严重，印度军队连日来出动“大力神”运输机向灾区空投救灾物资和药品，并出动直升机向灾区空投救援人员和医务人员。锡金当地政府已经建立了100多个临时居住点，安置房屋被损毁的当地居民。19日下午，印度军队重新开通了通往锡金首府甘托克的唯一国道。甘托克的供电也已恢复，但锡金大多数地区的电力供应还未恢复。当地政府要求居民和外来旅游者暂时不要离开甘托克。甘托克的学校也宣布停课3天，等待检查学校建筑是否安全。	吴强	负向	The number of people killed in the earthquake in the Indian state of Sikkim in the northeast has risen to 58. On September 20, the Xinhua News Agency in New Delhi reported that hundreds of people were injured in the earthquake that occurred on the 18th. It is reported that the Indian army and rescue personnel found more victims' bodies in some remote areas of Sikkim in the past 12 hours, and a total of 41 people have died in the earthquake in Sikkim so far. Since rescue workers have not yet entered the worst-hit areas around the epicenter, the final death toll is expected to rise. In addition, 17 people in the nearby states of West Bengal and Bihar also died of the earthquake. By the morning of the 20th, thousands of Indian soldiers were still working to clear the roads to remote areas of Sikkim, despite the danger of landslides at any moment. Due to the serious damage to the bridges and highways in the earthquake, the Indian army has been airlifting relief supplies and medicines to the disaster area by the “C-130” transport aircraft and airlifting rescue personnel and medical personnel by helicopter. The local government of Sikkim has established more than 100 temporary shelters to accommodate local residents whose houses were destroyed. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Indian army reopened the only national highway to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. Power supply has been restored in Gangtok, but electricity is still not available in most parts of Sikkim. Local government has asked residents and tourists to stay in Gangtok for the time being. Schools in Gangtok also announced three days of closure, waiting for the buildings of the schools to be checked for safety.

French player Valier Lagrave and Indian player Suma won the championship of the men's and women's groups respectively. Chinese chess player Zhang Xiaowen won the fourth place in the women's group. Yu Yangyi and Li Chao ranked 7th and 12th in the men's group respectively. ★ In the men's group, Vachier Lagrave overtook Yu Yangyi at the last moment in the seventh round, and the two decisive games that decided the men's champion came from the third seed, Belarusian Sergey Agarkalov and the eighth seed, Russian Ivan Popov, as well as the top seed, Frenchman Vachier Lagrave and the second seed, Russian Andreikin. After a fierce struggle for more than four hours, Sergey Dzagnidze, who was leading in the score, drew with Popov. Vachier Lagrave, who was half a point behind in the standings, won the game against Andreev with white pieces. Thus, Vassil-Lagrange equalized the score with Sergei Zhergalov at the last moment. After 13 rounds, the two teams had the same record of 8 wins and 5 draws, with 10.5 points each. Vasile-Lagrou won by a narrow margin and will also have a ticket to the next World Cup. Sergei Zhigalko came second, falling short of the gold. Vachier Lagrave is the second French chess player to win the World Junior Championship after the great French player Lotie. Polish chess player Olszewski and American chess player Linderman won the final round against Margovilashvili of Georgia and Iturraldega of Venezuela respectively, and both of them and Russian chess player Ivan Popov scored 9 points. After the comparison of the sub-points, Olszewski was fourth, Popov was fifth, and Lindemann was sixth. The 15-year-old Chinese player You Yangyi, who made his debut in the World Youth Chess Championship, played the first round of the last round against the Armenian player Grigoryan. After a balanced elephant and pawn endgame, they shook hands and drew after 41 moves. In this way, Yu Yangyi scored 8.5 points in 13 rounds with 7 wins, 3 draws and 3 losses. Andreev, Grigoryan of Armenia and Margovilashvili of Georgia all scored 8.5 points. After the comparison of sub-points, Andreev won the sixth round. Yu Yangyi ranked seventh. Grigoryan and Margvelashvili won 8th and 9th places. Yu Yangyi's performance score in the whole game reached 2618 points, which was much higher than his rating. Another Chinese player Li Chao drew with the Italian player Vockaturo in the last round with the black pieces, finishing with 8 points from 13 rounds (6 wins, 4 draws, 3 losses). In addition to Li Chao, who also scored 8 points, there were seven players, including Iturriaga from Venezuela, Rodstein from Israel, and Howell from the UK, who were ranked 7, 5, and 4, respectively. After the comparison of the sub-points, Iturizaga and Rodenstein were placed 10th and 11th, respectively. Li Chao is 12th, and Howel is 13th. Throughout the entire match, Li Chao's performance score was 2607, basically in line with his rating. ★Suma's team had a slightly higher score, and Xuewen won the championship. The situation of the women's group was similar to that of the men's group, with two India-India matches being the key matches to determine the champion. In the end, Suma, the Indian chess player, took a light victory over Ozturk of Turkey in the opening move. Ilteriz, a Turkish chess player, drew calmly with the Indian chess player Giri. In addition, the 16-year-old Peruvian player Deis-Cori, the third board, won the last game with black pieces and easily defeated the fourth board player from Romania, Paulete. Thus, Suma and Deiz-Cori tied the lead with points at the last moment, ahead of Irdiz. All three had 8 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses, with 9.5 points. Suma won the championship with a slightly higher score and automatically qualified for the Women's World Championship next year. Deiz-Cori won the silver medal, and Ilidis came in third place. Suma also became the third Indian female player to win the World Youth Championship after Koneeru and Harika. The second seed of the tournament, the Chinese player Zhang Xiaowen, defeated the first seed, Gomez of India, in the last round with the black pieces, and finally won 8 games, 2 draws and 3 losses, with 9 points in 13 rounds, ranking fourth. Zhang Xiaowen scored 2400 points throughout the entire match. Player No.7 from Georgia, Mikatsia, won the final game against Player No.5 from Russia, Severiukina, and finally finished in fifth place with 8.5 points. The fifth player, Severilukina of Russia, the fourth player, Paulete of Romania, the sixth player, Padmuni, a young player from India, the Norwegian player Tjorson, and the Indian player Gulan all scored 8 points and ranked sixth to tenth. The World Youth Chess Championship is a major individual event organized by FIDE, second only to the adult World Championship, and is held annually. The age of the participating chess players cannot exceed 20 years. 84 male and 45 female chess players participated in this World Youth Chess Championship. (Tar)
邵佳一返京回国足留洋球员困境折射中国足球尴尬本报记者郭剑12月23日，上海，2009足球热身赛，中国国家队以3∶2惊险逆转上海东亚。CFP供图今天下午，屯兵上海集训的国足在热身赛中以3∶2逆转中甲球队上海东亚。主教练高洪波在赛前向记者证实，效力于德乙科特布斯队的前国脚邵佳一，将于本周末重返国足参加备战。这意味着新一届国足集训队，终于有了海外球员的身影。邵佳一今天回到北京。对于自己再次入选国足，他向记者表示：“进入国家队是每一个职业球员的荣誉，我能够再次进入国家队感到非常激动”。自从去年3月在世界杯外围赛上踢飞了点球，邵佳一就再也没有出现在国足名单中，如今能被眼光颇高的主教练高洪波招入帐下，邵佳一凭借的完全是自己在德乙联赛中的出色表现。“在什么位置并不重要，我是新球员，要努力适应球队的技战术打法，加快和队友的磨合，争取早日进入状态”，邵佳一表现得很谦虚。德乙联赛上周进入了冬歇期。除了因伤休战的6场比赛，邵佳一在11场联赛中打进了6个球，这足以证明邵佳一以目前的状态，完全有资格在国家队中担任主力。实际上，国足教练组对于海外球员回国效力的渴望并非只是邵佳一一人——至少以个人能力衡量，效力于苏超球队凯尔特人的郑智和参加韩国联赛的李玮锋，都可以加强国足的实力，即便是刚刚结束在荷兰埃因霍温“留学”的周海滨，对于国足来说也会是极大的补充。只不过郑智还在凯尔特人预备队艰难打拼，李玮锋则因比赛中情绪控制问题难以入选。周海滨愿意积极面对现实，他作出了很大努力，但是没有留在埃因霍温。”周海滨中方经纪人罗曼说，“他圣诞节前就回国，下个赛季首选山东鲁能。”罗曼认为，即便是预备队的比赛，对周海滨也有很大帮助，只不过“竞争非常激烈”，所以周海滨选择了回国发展。“他并不认为没有留在埃因霍温就是彻底失败，毕竟他在这个赛季学到了很多东西，这对他的足球生涯很有帮助。”“我个人认为，以中国留洋球员的实力，完全能够在欧洲二流联赛中站稳脚跟，荣昊也是这样。”罗曼介绍说，荣昊能否在新赛季留洋，“目前还没有确定，因为中国足协的转会政策还没有正式出台，而荣昊所属的俱乐部又是武汉，情况比较特殊，不过，以他的能力可以适应欧洲的二流联赛。”在竞争激烈的欧洲足球赛场，中国国内顶尖水平的球员最好的结果也只是栖身于二流联赛，这也是众多经纪人在运作国脚留学时最为“头疼”的现实问题。“我感觉我们的球员很难在一级联赛中效力，这有多方面的原因。”罗曼说，“最大的原因是最近几年，国家队在国际大赛中的成绩不好，比赛质量也不高，所以国外俱乐部对于中国球员不会很感兴趣，中国球员还没有被人家普遍认可。”国家队的成绩历来是国际足球市场考察球员的一大硬性指标——中、日、韩三国中，中国球员留学海外的窘迫境地，一直和国家队的亚洲排名“挂钩”。原国安主帅李章洙在离开中国时说，中国球员往往自视过高，“很多球员甚至不相信同日本和韩国之间的差距有那么大”，“我希望中国球员能在日本和韩国的联赛中锻炼锻炼。现在不少韩国球员参加日本联赛，这里面也有出于国家队层面的考虑。不过，日本和韩国国家队的核心球员，都是在欧洲一流联赛中效力的。”以刚刚结束的两轮欧洲顶级联赛为例，韩国当红新锐李青龙为英超博尔顿队进球，前锋朴周永则为法甲摩纳哥队进球，在德甲踢球的车杜里为弗莱堡打满全场，该队最终输给多特蒙德也在情理之中，反倒是效力于曼联的“前辈”朴智星有些沉寂。韩国海外兵团的耀眼表现并没能完全抢走日本海外兵团的风头，虽然转投西甲西班牙人的中村俊辅仍得不到主教练的信任，但效力于法甲格勒诺布尔的松井大辅、效力于德甲波鸿的小野伸二和效力于意甲卡塔尼亚的森本贵幸均为首发球员，而卡塔尼亚击败尤文图斯也是本轮意甲的最大冷门。在日韩本月相继公布的国家集训队名单中，日本有6人在海外效力，韩国队海外兵团的成员更是多达7人，和明年10月就要参加世界杯亚洲区第一轮资格赛的国足相比，直接进入第三轮20强赛的日、韩，已经占有明显优势。“我个人并不看好国足能打进巴西世界杯，这和教练没关系，主要是球员的实力达不到。”一名足球经纪人告诉记者，“前几年，中国球员以为在国外联赛能挣很多钱，所以都愿意出国去见见世面，结果出去后发现自己水平不行，对环境也不适应，几乎没有上场机会。这两年，想出去的球员都比较实际了，不过，要想在国外顶级联赛占有一席之地，目前的这批球员都不够格。”本报北京12月23日电	邵佳一,郭剑,高洪波,郑智,李玮锋,埃因霍温,周海滨,罗曼,荣昊,李章洙,李青龙,朴周永,车杜里,弗莱堡,多特蒙德,朴智星,中村俊辅,松井大辅,小野伸二,森本贵幸	正向	"Jiayi Shao returned to Beijing, reflecting the dilemma of Chinese football players who have studied abroad. The reporter Guojian. On December 23, 2009, Shanghai, the Chinese national team won 3-2 against Shanghai East Asia in a football friendly match. CFP provided the picture. In the afternoon, the national team, which was training in Shanghai, turned the match against Shanghai Daxia, a team from the Chinese League, around to win 3-2 in a friendly match. The head coach Gao Hongbo confirmed to the media before the match that the former national team player Jia Yi, who plays for the second-tier club of the German Bundesliga, will return to the national team to participate in the preparation this weekend. This means that the new national football team training camp finally has the shadow of overseas players. Shao Jia Yi returned to Beijing today. Regarding his re-selection to the national team, he told the reporter, ""It is an honor for every professional player to enter the national team, and I feel very excited to be able to enter the national team again."" Since邵佳一 missed the penalty kick in the World Cup qualifier in March last year, he has never been included in the national team list. Now, he is selected by the coach Gao Hongbo, who has high standards, because of his excellent performance in the second tier of the German league. It is not important where I am placed. I am a new player and I need to work hard to adapt to the team's tactics and techniques, speed up the integration with my teammates, and strive to get into the game as soon as possible. Jia-yi Shao showed great humility. The 2nd tier of the German league went into winter break last week. Apart from the 6 matches he missed due to injury, Jia Yi scored 6 goals in 11 league matches, which is enough to prove that Jia Yi, with his current form, has the qualifications to be a regular in the national team. In fact, the national team coaching staff's desire for overseas players to return and play for the national team is not just for Shao Jia Yi. At least from the perspective of individual ability, Zheng Zhi, who plays for Kilmarnock in the Scottish Premier League, and Li Weifeng, who plays in the Korean league, can strengthen the national team. Even Zhou Haibin, who just finished his ""study"" in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, would be a great addition to the national team. Zheng Zhi was still struggling in the Celtic reserve team, while Li Weifeng was unable to be selected due to his emotional control problems in the match. Zhou Haibin is willing to face reality positively, and he has made great efforts, but he did not stay in Eindhoven. Roman, the Chinese agent of Zhou Haibin, said, ""He will return to China before Christmas, and his first choice for the next season is Shandong Luneng."" Roman believes that even the reserve team matches are very helpful to Zhou Heping, but ""the competition is very fierce"", so Zhou Heping chose to develop at home. He did not consider staying out of Ajax a total failure, after all, he learned a lot in this season, which was very helpful for his football career. I think that Chinese players who go abroad have the ability to stand firm in the second-tier leagues in Europe, and Rong Hao is also like this. Roman said that Rong Hao's going abroad in the new season is still not certain, because the transfer policy of the Chinese Football Association has not been officially issued, and Rong Hao's club is Wuhan, which is a special situation. However, his ability can adapt to the second-tier leagues in Europe. In the highly competitive European football field, the best result for the top players in China is to settle in the second-tier leagues, which is also the most ""painful"" reality that many agents face when operating the overseas study of national team players. I feel that it is difficult for our players to play in the top league, and there are many reasons for this. Roman said, ""The biggest reason is that the national team has not performed well in international competitions in recent years, and the quality of the games is also not high, so foreign clubs are not very interested in Chinese players, and Chinese players have not been generally recognized by others."" National team performance has always been a hard indicator for the international football market to evaluate players - among China, Japan, and South Korea, the plight of Chinese players studying abroad has always been ""linked"" to the national team's ranking in Asia. When the former head coach Li Zhangshu left China, he said that Chinese players often overestimated themselves, ""many players even did not believe that there was such a big gap between China and Japan and South Korea,"" ""I hope that Chinese players can be trained in the league of Japan and South Korea."" Now, many Korean players participate in the Japanese league, and there are also considerations at the national team level. However, the core players of the Japanese and South Korean national teams play in top-tier European leagues. Take the last two rounds of the top European leagues as an example, Lee Chinglong, the rising star from South Korea, scored for Bolton in the Premier League, while Park Chul-young scored for Monaco in the Ligue 1. Che Duri, who plays in the Bundesliga, played the full 90 minutes for Freiburg, and it was only natural that the team lost to Dortmund. On the contrary, the ""senior"" Park Ji-sung, who plays for Manchester United, has been somewhat quiet. The dazzling performance of the South Korean overseas brigade could not completely overshadow the Japanese overseas brigade, although the coach still did not trust the midfielders Jun辅中村, but Da辅松井, Shinji Kiyoshi of Guingamp in Ligue 1, Shinji Okazaki of Bochum in Bundesliga, and Kiyoshi Mori of Catania in Serie A were all starting players, and Catania's victory over Juventus was also the biggest upset of this round of Serie A. In the national team training list released by Japan and South Korea in the same month, there are 6 players in Japan who are playing abroad, and the number of players in the South Korean team who are playing abroad is as high as 7. Compared with the national team that will participate in the first round of the Asian qualification for the World Cup in October next year, Japan and South Korea, which have directly entered the third round of the 20 strong teams, have obvious advantages. I don't think the Chinese national team can qualify for the Brazil World Cup, and this has nothing to do with the coach, mainly because the players' strength does not meet the requirements. “A football agent told a reporter that in the past few years, Chinese players thought they could earn a lot of money in foreign leagues, so they were willing to go abroad to broaden their horizons. However, after going abroad, they found that their level was not good, and they were not adapted to the environment, and they had almost no chance to play. In the past two years, the players who wanted to go out have been more practical, but at present, none of the players are qualified to occupy a place in the top foreign leagues. This report from Beijing, December 23."

iPhone版Skype最早下周发布新浪科技讯北京时间3月27日上午消息，据国外媒体报道，可靠消息称，针对苹果iPhone(手机上网)手机而开发的Skype软件最早将于下周发布。该消息称，Skype很可能在4月1日召开的无线通信展(CTIAWireless)上发布iPhone版Skype。当前，iPhone用户只能通过第三方服务访问Skype。此前，Skype已经推出了针对WindowsMobile智能手机的Skype应用。因此，推出iPhone版Skype应用早在人们预料之中。对于iPhone用户而言，这无疑是个好消息。但短期内，Skype应用还不可能取代标准的iPhone语音呼叫。在通话质量上，VoIP的表现还不是特别令人满意。此外，根据iPhone用户的通话习惯，使用Skype也不会在很大程度上降低通话费。但在国际长途上，使用Skype确实可节省不少费用。有消息称，苹果第三代iPhone将支持视频捕捉功能。如果属实，当2011年AT&T将网络升级到4G后，Skype还可以将iPhone变成一部便携视频会议设备。(李明)相关报道：Skype将推iPhone版免费通话软件苹果第三代iPhone可能6月8日发布	李明	正向	The Skype app for iPhone is expected to be released as early as next week, according to reliable sources reported by foreign media. Sina Tech News, March 27, 2019 The report says that Skype is likely to launch the iPhone version of Skype at the CTIA Wireless trade show on April 1. Currently, iPhone users can only access Skype through third-party services. Previously, Skype had launched a Skype application for Windows Mobile smart phones. Thus, the release of the Skype application for the iPhone was not unexpected. This is undoubtedly good news for iPhone users. But in the short term, the Skype app is unlikely to replace standard iPhone voice calls. In terms of call quality, VoIP is not yet fully satisfactory. In addition, the calling habits of iPhone users mean that using Skype will not significantly reduce calling costs. But on international long-distance calls, using Skype can save a lot of money. There is news that the third generation iPhone from Apple will support video capture. If true, Skype could have turned the iPhone into a mobile videoconferencing device when AT&T upgraded its network to 4G in 2011. (Li Ming) Related report: Skype will launch a free calling software for iPhone. The third generation of iPhone may be released on June 8.

房地产：环首都经济圈规划带来地产机会海通证券涂力磊事件：近日，河北省邀请包括北京市规划委在内的官员、专家学者，就“环首都经济圈”规划编制方案征集意见。会上，北京市规划委副主任王飞表示，北京“不会独自建设首善之区”，而会通过区域整体发展的方式，来解决面临的问题。河北省委常委、常务副省长赵勇表示，将借鉴东京、首尔等首都经济圈的经验，制订总体规划、专项规划、控制性详规等，预计将在明年1月底前完成。点评：1.“虹吸”效应带来城市问题。作为中国首都的北京，一直以来在招商引资、政策扶持、金融支持等方面都享有明显的优惠。这种待遇上的不平等直接造成北京的发展程度远超出周边、甚至是国内所有城市。这一现象的直接结果就是所谓的“虹吸”效应，即首都周边地区的人才、资金、资源都不同程度向北京集中。大量人口、资源的集中使得北京在快速发展后出现众多城市病，如人口膨胀、交通拥挤、资源紧张、房价高涨、发展空间受限、改善生态环境压力加大等突出问题。在北京可开发面积日益减小的今天，这些城市病显得更加明显。2.从“虹吸”效应到“溢出”效应。“环首都经济圈”就是在这样的背景下所产生。其主要目的在于在政策和规划上给与北京周边地区一定扶持，使得相关区域可以进一步承接北京的“溢出效应”。在北京高速发展之后，将相关过多的产业、人口、资金向周边地区覆盖。3.“环首都经济圈”介绍。“环首都经济圈”建设的总体思路，是在邻近北京将近1000公里的范围内，主要包括环绕北京的张家口、承德、廊坊、保定四个地级市，建设一个发展特区；包括建设高层次人才创业园区、科技成果孵化园区、新兴产业示范园区、现代物流园区，以新兴产业为主导的经济圈。这个发展特区将包括京东、京南、京北三个新城以及7个人口在30万人以上的中等规模城市，将环绕北京的区域建成一个全封闭的城市带。4.投资建议。目前许多国家首都经济圈创造的生产总值占国家的三分之一以上。而京津冀三省市，2009年GDP合计为36600亿，占全国的比重仅为10.9%，距离达到全国1/3还差75180多亿。虽然因为我国国土面积较大，城市聚集不可能达到日本、韩国的程度。但是，相关产业承接、人口迁移针必然给经济圈内城市带来经济发展和地价重估。在经济圈内享有土地储备的房地产公司无疑将直接受益。我们认为“首都经济圈”相对其他区域振兴概念而言具备更大的现实意义，可以直接解决目前首都所面临的众多问题。因此概念后在后期有望持续升温。概念相关受益个股包括：荣盛发展、亿城股份、万通地产、空港股份。5.风险提示。目前不排除国家出台进一步的紧缩政策，将会对地产行业的运行产生相对负面的影响。	涂力磊,王飞,赵勇	正向	"Real Estate: The planning of the Capital Economic Circle brings real estate opportunities. Huatong Securities Tu Lilei incident: Recently, Hebei Province invited officials, experts and scholars from the Beijing Urban Planning Commission and other departments to solicit opinions on the planning scheme of the ""Capital Economic Circle"". At the meeting, Wang Fei, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning, said that Beijing would not build a model district alone, but would solve the problems it faced through the coordinated development of the region as a whole. Zhao Yong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the vice governor in charge of the province, said that they would draw on the experience of the capital economic circles of Tokyo, Seoul and other cities, and formulate a general plan, a special plan, a detailed control plan, and so on. It is expected to be completed by the end of January next year. Comment: 1. The ""siphon"" effect brings urban problems. As the capital of China, Beijing has always enjoyed obvious advantages in attracting investment, policy support, and financial support. This inequality in treatment directly results in Beijing’s level of development far outstripping that of its neighbors, and even all other cities in the country. The direct result of this phenomenon is what is known as the ""siphon"" effect, in which talents, capital, and resources in the surrounding areas of the capital are concentrated in Beijing to a greater or lesser extent. The concentration of a large population and resources has led to a number of urban ills in Beijing after rapid development, such as population explosion, traffic congestion, resource shortage, soaring housing prices, limited development space, and increased pressure to improve the ecological environment. With the decreasing developable land in Beijing today, these urban ills are becoming more apparent. From the ""siphon"" effect to the ""spillover"" effect. The ""环首都经济圈"" was generated in this context. Its main purpose is to provide some support to the areas around Beijing in terms of policies and planning, so that the relevant regions can further承接 Beijing's ""spillover effects"". After the rapid development of Beijing, the related industries, population, and capital will be covered to the surrounding areas. 3. Introduction to the Capital Economic Circle. The overall thinking of the construction of the ""ring capital economic circle"" is to build a development zone in the nearly 1000 kilometers around Beijing, mainly including Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Langfang, and Baoding, four prefecture-level cities surrounding Beijing. It includes the construction of high-level talent entrepreneurship park, science and technology achievement incubation park, new industry demonstration park, logistics park, and economic circle with new industry as the main body. This development zone will include three new towns, Jingdong, Jingnan, and Jingbei, and seven medium-sized cities with a population of more than 300,000, and will build a fully enclosed urban belt around the area of Beijing. 4. Investment advice. Currently, the gross domestic product created by the economic circles of many countries' capital cities accounts for more than one-third of the country. And the GDP of the three provinces and municipalities of Jing-Jin-Ji in 2009 was 3.66 trillion yuan, accounting for only 10.9% of the national total, and was still short of 7.518 trillion yuan to reach one-third of the country. Although, due to the large territory of our country, the concentration of cities cannot reach the level of Japan and South Korea. But, the承接of related industries and the migration of population will inevitably bring about economic development and a revaluation of land prices in the cities within the economic circle. Real estate companies with land reserves within economic circles will undoubtedly benefit directly. We believe that the ""Capital Economic Circle"" has greater practical significance than other regional revitalization concepts and can directly address the many problems currently faced by the capital. Thus, the concept is likely to continue heating up in the later stage. Concept-related beneficiary individual stocks include Rongsheng Development, Yicheng Shares, Wonton Real Estate, and Konggang Shares. 5. Risk warning. There is currently no exclusion of the possibility that the state will introduce further tightening policies, which will have a relatively negative impact on the operation of the real estate industry."

As the rock music that Wang Feng's music is considered to be the most mainstream and the most rock in mainstream music. For Wang Feng, such praise does not mean that he feels successful at present: ""The biggest experience to be able to do so far is that you need to have enough endurance and tolerance to endure a lot of doubts, suspicion, and abuse during the period of non-understanding, and have a mature mentality and firm ideas to bear these. When success comes, you will not feel elated because of success. I think it's like this. Wang Feng's success also inspired many young people to join the ranks of domestic rock. When asked if he planned to develop new talents, Wang Feng said that what he had done in China had already provided them with a lot of space to do rock music. But it's quite rare to have a rock musician who is good enough. I hope all the people who make music work hard, strive, and be down-to-earth. Lake water/Wen"
陆天明专访：我迷上了微博不会催着陆川结婚8月21日至24日，本报举办“群英汇”名家笔会，著名作家陆天明应邀出席。从与韩寒之间的激烈对话，到动车事故后成为话题人物，陆天明都在专访中做出回应。采访中，记者还提到了导演陆川(微博)与女星秦岚(微博)的恋情，身为陆川的父亲，陆天明坦言，他很着急当爷爷。迷上微博有不会的地方就问网友陆天明抵连当日，记者在其入住的酒店对其进行了一次专访。在酒店房间的写字桌上，陆天明的电脑上显示的是微博网页。“你是微博控？”听到记者这样问，陆天明呵呵地笑了起来，“我应该算是吧。不过，我已经在控制了，我没换手机就是让自己别这么迷微博。我有不少朋友，飞机一落地，立刻打开手机看微博，就连吃饭的时候也要看，而我已经很控制了。”刚玩微博的时候，陆天明有许多功能都不会用，“有不会的地方我就问网友，有很多人来教我，现在我会加关注、发私信，还会发长微博，都是网友们教我的。”因为开通了博客，2009年，陆天明与韩寒在博客上展开了激烈辩论，那段时间里，陆天明俨然成了话题人物。在采访中，他主动向记者提及当年的那次吵架经历。“我当年在博客上与韩寒吵架，网上骂声一片。当时网站的人劝我要不把博客关闭了吧，但我没关。如果没有当年的那次吵架，我真不知道网络上还有那样的年轻人，他们有那样的思想、价值观。”时隔几年，陆天明说，当年第一次在网络上看到那些激烈的评论时，他气得浑身都在打颤，“后来我理解了，每个人都有本来的我，不同场合戴着不同面具，在网络上，大家都躲在电脑背后，就可以完全暴露自己了。”如今，陆天明已能很坦然地面对网络上的各种评论，“因为不同的人对事情会有不同的看法。”身陷舆论已能坦然面对言语攻击开了博客之后，因为与韩寒吵架的事情，陆天明在博客上成为话题人物。开通微博后，前段时间，动车发生事故，陆天明因为一条微博，又一次成为话题人物。对于这次成为话题人物，陆天明很愤怒也很无奈，“我的那条微博上传于动车出事之前，我觉得是有些人故意那样转发我的微博，而且，我在动车出事之后再发的微博，那些人好像根本不看，一味混淆视听，用我之前发的微博说事儿。”事后，有朋友劝陆天明删了那条微博，他坚决拒绝，“我问心无愧，绝对不删除。”采访中，陆天明说因为创作的缘故，他曾经采访过研究高铁的工程师，“作为我们国家自主研发的技术，我知道那些工程师们有多么不容易。出事之后，我刚好在上海，本来要坐飞机回北京的，我退了飞机票，专门买了高铁票，这不是作秀，因为我真的认为这项技术是我们民族的骄傲。”与上一次看到网上各类人说出各种伤人的话不同，这一次面对网络上的攻击，陆天明坦然许多，“我明白微博上有各种各样的人，应该理性对待，所以这一次无论看到大家写出什么偏激的话，我都能接受了。”文学创作应该放下架子走近大众陆天明曾在安徽农村当过农民、小学教师，在新疆生产建设兵团当过农工、农场武装连代理指导员、场机关干部，现任中央电视台电视剧制作中心文学部专职编剧，《大雪无痕》、《省委书记》、《命运》都是他的代表作。谈到文学，陆天明说，如今纯文学的环境已经不如当年，“但曾经不少作家对纯文学的追求，也有一些过火。不少追求纯文学的人，不太看重读者的反应，只表现自我，甚至有的人还以此为荣。”对于这样的做法，陆天明说自己也曾经有过，“比如，我写的小说《泥日》，当年二十多位评委看完之后，都说不知道我在说什么。当时写的就是不告诉你主题，就让人看不懂。”但随着社会的发展，陆天明认为搞纯文学是不行的，“我用了十年的时间来转型，之所以能写出那么好看的故事，我是经历了很痛苦的转型期的。文学不应该高高在上，而应该更接地气，必须要让读者喜欢阅读，跟着故事一起哭一起笑，纯文学不能像从前那样看不起大众，而应该放下架子，让老同志和老百姓都满意。”儿子婚事换种方式催促陆川结婚陆天明早年成名，那个时候，他常听人说：“这是陆川，陆天明的儿子。”而如今，随着儿子陆川名气越来越大，很多人都会说：“这是陆天明，陆川的爸爸。”对于这样的转换，陆天明其实很高兴，“哪有父母不希望自己的孩子有出息的，我儿子能有这样大的出息，我真是睡觉的时候都要笑醒。”父亲是编剧，儿子是导演，两个人有太多的可能合作出一部作品，对于这样的说法，陆天明说他们也有此意，“很早之前就有人问我和陆川能不能一起做一部电影出来，我们有这个意向，但至少现在还没有成型。这样一部作品，一定得是我和陆川都满意的，要找到我们两代人之间最好的契合点，要一加一能大于二，不然随便做出一部作品，很容易被人认为有捞一票的嫌疑。”今年结婚的明星格外多，采访中，记者问及陆川与女友秦岚是不是也好事将近。对于儿子的终身大事，陆天明像所有剩男剩女的家长一样着急，但他却笑着说他不会催，“我不催他结婚，但会变相地问他，我什么时候能抱上孙子或孙女，用这个办法催他。”记者方海征事件回放陆川秦岚因拍“南京”相恋2009年9月，有圈内人士爆料，称《南京！南京！》导演陆川与戏中主演秦岚因戏结缘，正在热恋。2008年10月，就有网友爆料看到二人约会拥吻，由此可见这段恋情持续已久。记者联络上当时正在法国准备转机参加圣塞巴斯蒂安国际电影节的陆川，他大方回应并承认恋情。据悉，秦岚不仅以“零片酬”出演《南京！南京！》，还因为档期问题支付了另一个剧组数十万的赔偿金，为拍摄付出了巨大心血，她的出色演出打动了影片导演陆川，“友情”渐渐升华为“爱情”。尽管相恋已久，但二人一直十分低调。据《重庆晚报》报道相关阅读秦岚演“吕后”被批又老又胖这是服从陆川的命令秦岚在男友陆川导演的新片《王的盛宴》里饰演“吕后”，早前亮相时惹来不少杂音，从批评她的皮肤松弛，到胖得太夸张，再到“孕相十足”。前日，秦岚接受了记者采访，大方回应争议，她坦言，这一切都是为了陆川，她“服从命令”地变胖变老。记者：大家都说你变胖了。秦岚：为了演吕后这个角色，导演希望我增肥嘛。我以前的体重差不多是95斤到96斤，现在应该是108斤左右。记者：陆川一直嫌你太瘦？秦岚：以前陆川就觉得我的形象比较纤细，吕后在电影中出现时，年纪已经比较大了，如果太单薄的话，这个人物的气场就不够。他希望我能够胖一点，因为胖能显出成熟感，在这个基础上再去做一些老态的造型，出来的效果会比较好。记者：会不会抱怨导演让自己做这么大的牺牲？秦岚：我难受啊，我以前能穿的衣服，现在死活都穿不上了，拍完这部戏我马上就去强制减肥。记者：陆川导演在表演上给你很大压力吗？秦岚：拍了这么多年戏，“吕后”是我最难完成的角色。有段时间我的压力很大，精神极度紧张，尽管我心里特别想吃东西，但经常吃不下，可为了变胖，还是得吃。记者：很多人看你发胖，都问你是不是怀孕了？秦岚：因为他们不知道我为什么会发胖。他们说太胖了，应该是怀孕了，其实我还挺开心的，因为我一直担心自己不能在这么短的时间里变胖，没想到我做到了。据《新快报》报道	陆天明,陆川,韩寒,秦岚,方海征,吕后	正向	"Lu Tianming Interview: I am obsessed with Weibo and will not urge Lu Chuan to get married.

During the interview, the reporter also mentioned the romance between the director Lu Chuan (Weibo) and the actress Qin Lan (Weibo). As the father of Lu Chuan, Lu Tianming admitted that he was very eager to be a grandfather. Being addicted to Weibo, if there are any problems, ask the netizen Lu Tianming. On the day he arrived in Dalian, the journalist interviewed him for a special interview at the hotel where he checked in. On the writing desk in the hotel room, the computer of Lu Tianming showed the Weibo webpage. Are you a Weibo addict? Hearing the reporter ask like that, Lu Tianming chuckled and said, ""I should be."" But, I have it under control. I didn't change my phone to stop myself from being so obsessed with Weibo. I have many friends who immediately open their phones to check Weibo as soon as the plane lands, even during meals, while I have already controlled myself. When Lu Tianming first started playing Weibo, he did not know how to use many functions. ""When I didn't know how to do something, I asked netizens, and many people taught me. Now I can add followers, send private messages, and post long Weibos, all of which were taught to me by netizens."" Because of the blog, in 2009, Lu Tianming and Han Han had a heated debate on the blog, during which time Lu Tianming was a topic of discussion. In the interview, he brought up the argument he had had with the reporter that year. I had a quarrel with Han Han on my blog, and there was a lot of online abuse. At that time, the people on the website advised me to close the blog, but I didn't. Without that quarrel back then, I really wouldn't have known that there were such young people on the Internet, with such thoughts and values. Years later, Lu Tianming said that when he first saw those intense comments on the Internet, he was so angry that he was trembling all over. ""Later, I understood that everyone has their own true self, and wears different masks in different situations. On the Internet, everyone can hide behind the computer and completely expose themselves."" Now, Lu Tianming can face all kinds of comments on the Internet with a calm mind, because different people have different views on things. After being involved in public opinion, Lu Tianming could face verbal attacks with a calm mind. After opening a blog, he became a topic figure on the Internet because of the argument with Han Han. After opening his microblog, Lu Tianming became a topic again due to a microblog post about the accident of the EMU in the recent period. Lu Tianming was very angry and helpless about becoming a topic. ""My Weibo was uploaded before the high-speed train accident. I think some people deliberately forwarded my Weibo. Moreover, after the high-speed train accident, those people seemed to not read my Weibo, and confused the public opinion, using my previous Weibo to talk about it."" Later, a friend advised Lu Tianming to delete that Weibo post, but he firmly refused, ""I have no regrets, and I will never delete it."" In the interview, Lu Tianming said that because of his creation, he had interviewed the engineers who studied high-speed rail. ""As the technology independently developed by our country, I know how hard those engineers have worked."" After the incident, I happened to be in Shanghai, and I was originally going to take a plane back to Beijing. I refunded the plane ticket and specially bought a high-speed rail ticket. This is not a show, because I really think that this technology is the pride of our nation. Unlike the last time when all kinds of people on the Internet said hurtful things, Lu Tianming was much more at ease this time when facing online attacks. ""I understand that there are all kinds of people on Weibo, so I should treat them rationally. Therefore, no matter what extreme words everyone writes, I can accept them."" Literary creation should put down its airs and get closer to the masses. Lu Tianming once worked as a farmer and a primary school teacher in Anhui countryside, and as a farm worker and deputy guide of the armed company in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. He is now a full-time screenwriter of the Literature Department of the TV Drama Production Center of China Central Television. ""Great Snow Without Traces"", ""Provincial Party Secretary"", and ""Fate"" are his representative works. When it comes to literature, Lu Tianming said that the environment for pure literature is not as good as it was in the past, ""but many writers' pursuit of pure literature was a bit too much in the past."" Many people who pursue pure literature do not attach much importance to the reaction of readers, but only show themselves, and some even take pride in it. Lu Tianming said that he had done this before, for example, when he wrote the novel ""Mud Day"" and more than twenty judges said after reading it that they did not know what he was talking about. At the time, it was written so that people couldn't understand it without telling them the theme. But as society developed, Lu Tianming believed that pure literature was no longer viable. ""I took ten years to transform myself, and the reason I was able to write such good stories was that I went through a very painful period of transformation."" Literature should not be aloof, but should be more down-to-earth, and must make readers like reading, cry and laugh with the story. Pure literature cannot look down on the masses as it did in the past, but should put down its pride and make both the old comrades and the masses satisfied. The son's marriage is a way to urge Lu Chuan to get married. Lu Tianming became famous early in his career, and at that time, he often heard people say, ""This is Lu Chuan, Lu Tianming's son."" Now, as Lu Chuan's fame grows, many people say, ""This is Lu Tianming, Lu Chuan's father."" Lu Tianming was actually very happy about such a transformation. Who doesn't want their children to have a bright future? I am so happy that my son has such a great future that I laugh in my sleep. The father is a screenwriter and the son is a director. The two of them have many possibilities to collaborate on a work. Lu Tianming said that they also had this intention, ""Someone asked me and Lu Chuan whether we could make a movie together a long time ago. We have this intention, but at least now it has not taken shape."" This work must be satisfactory to both of us. We need to find the best point of convergence between the two generations, and one plus one must be greater than two. Otherwise, it is easy for people to think that we are trying to make a quick buck. There are more celebrities getting married this year. In an interview, the reporter asked Lu Chuan and girlfriend Qin Lan whether they were also about to have a good thing. Lu Tianming, like the parents of all bachelors and spinsters, is anxious about his son’s lifelong matters, but he smiles and says he will not urge him to get married. I will not urge him to get married, but I will ask him in a roundabout way when I can hold a grandson or granddaughter, and use this method to urge him. ""Reporter Fang Hanzheng event replay Lu Chuan Qin Lan because shooting 'Nanjing' in love in September 2009, insiders in the industry revealed that ""Nanjing!"" Nanjing! Director Lu Chuan and actress Qin Lan, who starred in the film, have fallen in love. In October 2008, netizens reported that they saw the two people dating and kissing, which shows that this romance has lasted for a long time. Lu Chuan, who was then preparing to transfer in France to attend the San Sebastian International Film Festival, was contacted by the journalist and responded generously and admitted to the relationship. It is reported that Qin Lan not only starred in ""Nanjing!"" for free. Nanjing! She also paid another production team hundreds of thousands of yuan in compensation due to scheduling issues, and she put a lot of effort into filming. Her excellent performance moved the film director Lu Chuan, and ""friendship"" gradually evolved into ""love"". Though they have been in love for a long time, the two of them have always been very low-key. According to the Chongqing Evening News, Qin Lan played ""Lü Hou"" and was criticized for being old and fat, which was in compliance with Lu Chuan's order. Qin Lan played ""Lü Hou"" in Lu Chuan's new film ""The Banquet of the King"", and she was criticized for her loose skin, exaggerated weight gain, and pregnancy-like appearance. The day before yesterday, Qin Lan accepted an interview with a journalist and responded generously to the controversy. She admitted that all of this was for Lu Chuan, and she ""obeyed orders"" to gain weight and age. Reporter: Everyone says you have gained weight. Qin Lan: In order to play the role of Empress Lu, the director hopes that I will gain weight. My previous weight was about 95 to 96 pounds, and now it should be around 108 pounds. Reporter: Lu Chuan always thinks you are too thin? Qin Lan: Previously, Lu Chuan thought that my image was relatively delicate. When Empress Lu appeared in the film, she was already quite old. If she was too thin, the aura of this character would be insufficient. He hopes that I can be a little fatter, because fat can show maturity, and then do some old-fashioned styling on this basis, which will produce a better effect. The reporter asked, ""Do you complain about the director making such a big sacrifice for you?"" Qin Lan: I am so uncomfortable. The clothes I used to wear can no longer fit me. I will go on a forced diet as soon as I finish shooting this drama. The reporter asked: Does Director Lu Chuan put a lot of pressure on your performance? Qin Lan: After so many years of acting, ""Empress Lu"" is the most difficult role for me to complete. For a while, I was under a lot of stress and was extremely nervous. Although I really wanted to eat, I often couldn't, but I still had to eat to gain weight. The reporter asked, ""Have many people asked you if you are pregnant because you have gained weight?""  Qin Lan: Because they don't know why I gained weight. They said I was too fat, I should be pregnant, actually I was quite happy, because I was always worried that I couldn't get fat in such a short time, never thinking that I could do it.

鲍文明日开发布会宣布退役防守悍将从此归隐山林新浪体育讯　北京时间9月3日消息，据美媒体projectspurs消息，在ESPN1250一档节目中爆料布鲁斯-鲍文将于明天召开一个发布会宣布正式退役。上个赛季结束之后马刺将鲍文交易去了雄鹿，换来了理查德-杰弗森。随后鲍文就被雄鹿裁掉。可是他却拒绝了来自凯尔特人的一份合约，一心想要重回圣安东尼奥。可是马刺阵中也再也没有他的位置。拥有了杰弗森和迈克尔-芬利之后，鲍文几乎不会再有表现的机会；而且马刺的薪金压力也让他们不再将鲍文放在球队的计划之中。所以最终鲍文选择退役。当然也不排除如果马刺在季后赛中发生伤病，需要一个顽强的防守者的时候，鲍文重出江湖。发布会将于明天下午2点举行。鲍文在选秀大会上落选，一直在海外打球，直到1996年加盟热火。不过一年之后热火就将他裁掉。此后，鲍文辗转波士顿凯尔特人队、费城76人队和圣安东尼奥马刺队。鲍文是现在联盟中最好的外线防守者之一，也是现在联盟中最肮脏的防守者。他依靠对防守的全神贯注，强硬的贴身干扰，对持球队员实施巨大的压力。鲍文曾经多次被指责在防守中使用有可能伤人的小动作，雷-阿伦等球员和伊塞亚-托马斯等教练都曾批评过鲍文的防守风格。在马刺鲍文迎来了职业生涯的巅峰期，他从2001年到2003年连续三年入选最佳防守二队，2004到2007年则连续入选最佳防守一队。2003、2005和2007年跟随马刺三夺总冠军。最重要的是，在马刺8年，鲍文只缺席了26场比赛，后七年只休息了3场，堪称铁人。(暖暖)	鲍文,布鲁斯-鲍文,理查德-杰弗森,杰弗森,凯尔特人,迈克尔-芬利,雷-阿伦,伊塞亚-托马斯,托马斯,暖暖	正向	Bao Wen will hold a press conference to announce his retirement from the defensive tough player who will return to the mountains and forests. Sina Sports News, on September 3rd, according to the US media Project Spurs, Bruce Bowen will hold a press conference to announce his retirement on the ESPN 1250 program. After the end of last season, the Spurs traded Bowen to the Bucks in exchange for Richard Jefferson. Bowen was then cut by the Bucks. But he turned down a contract offer from the Celtics, and wanted to return to San Antonio. But there was no place for him on the Spurs either. With Jefferson and Michael-Finley on board, Bowen would have almost no chance to play, and the Spurs’ salary cap concerns had also made them reluctant to include Bowen in their plans. So Bowen finally chose to retire. Of course, Bowen could come out of retirement if the Spurs need a tough defender during the playoffs and get injured. The press conference will be held at 2 p.m. tomorrow. Bowen was not selected in the draft and played overseas until he joined the Heat in 1996. But the Heat cut him a year later. After that, Bowen played for the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, and San Antonio Spurs. Bowen is one of the best perimeter defenders in the current league and also one of the dirtiest defenders in the current league. He relies on total concentration on defense, tough body-to-body interference, and immense pressure on the ball handler. Bowen was often criticized for using dirty tactics that could hurt opponents during defense, and players such as Ray Allen and coaches such as Isiah Thomas criticized Bowen's defensive style. In the Spurs, Bowen reached the peak of his career. He was selected to the All-Defensive Second Team for three consecutive years from 2001 to 2003, and then to the All-Defensive First Team for three consecutive years from 2004 to 2007. Won three championships with the Spurs in 2003, 2005 and 2007. Most importantly, Bowen only missed 26 games in eight years with the Spurs, and only took three days off in the last seven years, making him a true iron man. (Warm)
德邦证券：放量突破可看高一线德邦证券节后开门红的行情虽然在市场普遍预料之中，但上周沪深市场强劲走势仍然给了市场不小的惊喜。在部分经济数据反弹(PMI，VAI以及M2增速等)、政策面扶持(产业振兴规划、中央支农一号文件、创业板推出、IPO重启辟谣等)、海外市场触底反弹以及市场资金面宽松等多重因素支撑下，上周沪深两市出现了放量大涨的行情。其中沪指上涨了193.6点，涨幅达到了9.57%；深圳指数上涨了756.7点，涨幅为10.79%。两市成交量出现了显著放大，较节前交易周分别放大53.3%和60%。市场面临前期重要阻力位2100点时，仅仅用了半个交易日便完成了调整，走出放量突破的行情，市场短期强势展露无遗。由于短期内国内宏观经济看不到利空数据，处于短暂的利空数据真空期；而政策面和资金面在较为宽松的环境下还将继续推动市场走高。我们判断市场在本周内将遇到上行通道上轨2250后展开回调，市场热点仍将集中在政策受益类股票以及一、二线蓝筹股的补涨上。短期内仍可继续持有多头仓位，但在2250附近的重要阻力位置应主动减仓，防止短线出现急速回调。需要强调的是目前仍然是熊市中的反弹行情：经济基本面短期难以改善是制约市场中期上涨的主要因素，尽管政策面的扶持对市场预期有较大改善，但短期内难以根本扭转经济的下滑趋势。因此对后市行情的演绎呈谨慎乐观的态度，我们认为短期内2250附近的阻力位难以有效突破，投资者应做好随时获利止盈的准备。继国资委推出10大行业振兴规划后，汽车、钢铁和纺织、装备制造行业调整振兴规划已相继出炉，而电子信息产业的振兴规划也已提交国家发改委讨论并初步得到认可，即将成为第三批获得通过的行业振兴规划。中央在新年推出的一号文件再次将农业也纳入到积极扶持行业当中，除了家电、手机下乡以外，汽车和农机下乡也在推行之中，投资者对启动农村市场给予了较高的期盼。此外，央行也在逐步落实适度宽松的货币政策以加大金融对经济的支持力度，不仅未来存在持续降息的可能，而且货币供应增速M2出现了明显的反弹：12月增速由11月的14.8%提高了3个百分点至17.8%。作为市场领先指标M2的反弹和市场资金面的充裕都为市场走好提供了良好的外部条件。尽管海外市场基本面数据持续恶化，但市场在前期底部获得良好支撑，短期走稳对A股形成较好的外部氛围。所以综合经济基本面和政策以及外围市场因素的影响，我们认为市场短期仍将继续冲高，本周有望挑战2250点关口。鉴于冲高回落的概率在增大，建议投资者保持必要的谨慎，在高位应适当降低仓位，规避回调的风险。从纯技术面角度看，市场在面临重要技术压力位时走出了放量突破的走势，表明未来行情仍将向纵深发展。从均线形态来看，各条均线指标均呈多头排列，且沪深股指双双站稳120天的半年线，市场的中线技术指标趋于转强。从波浪形态来看，目前市场运行的上行通道下轨已经攀升至2020点一线，这将成为市场短期冲高回落后的重要支撑点位。而上行通道上轨已到达2250点一线，由于此区域为前期巨量套牢筹码区域，市场在此点位将遇到较大的抛压，短线冲高回落的概率加大。中短期的RSI和KDJ已经再次攀升到高位，且并未随股指同时创出新高，反应市场做多动能出现一定衰减，回调的技术压力在加大。综合技术面分析，我们认为本周有望冲击2250点关口，但考虑到经济基本面的因素我们依然坚持逢高减仓止盈的操作策略，短线防范冲过回调的风险。		正向	DBS: Breakthrough with increased volume to see a little higher DBSAlthough the market rally after the holiday was expected by the market, the strong performance of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets last week still gave the market a big surprise. With the support of multiple factors such as a rebound in some economic data (PMI, VAI, and M2 growth rate, etc.), policy support (industrial revitalization plan, central agricultural support No. 1 document, introduction of the Growth Enterprise Market, and rumors of resumption of IPO, etc.), bottom rebound of overseas markets, and easing of market liquidity, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets experienced a volume surge and a strong rise last week. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 193.6 points, up 9.57%, while Shenzhen Index rose by 756.7 points, up 10.79%. Trading volumes in both cities saw a significant increase, up 53.3% and 60% respectively compared to the trading week before the holiday. The market, which faced a significant resistance level of 2,100 points at the beginning, completed the adjustment in just half a trading day, showing a breakout with increased volume, revealing the market's short-term strength. With no negative macroeconomic data in the short term, the market is in a short-term vacuum of negative data, and the policy and capital faces will continue to push the market higher in a relatively宽松的环境. We judge that the market will experience a pullback after encountering the upper track of the upward channel 2250 in this week, and the market focus will still be on the catch-up of policy-benefited stocks and blue-chip stocks in the first and second lines. Hold long positions for the short term, but reduce positions actively near the important resistance level of 2250 to prevent a sharp short-term retracement. It is worth emphasizing that the current market is still a rebound in a bear market: it is difficult for the fundamentals of the economy to improve in the short term, which is the main factor constraining the market's long-term rise. Although policy support has significantly improved market expectations, it is difficult to fundamentally reverse the downward trend of the economy in the short term. Therefore, we take a cautiously optimistic view of the future market performance. We believe that it is difficult for the resistance level around 2250 to be effectively broken in the short term, and investors should be prepared to take profits at any time. After the SASAC launched the revitalization plan for 10 industries, the adjustment and revitalization plans for the automobile, steel and textile and equipment manufacturing industries have been successively unveiled, and the revitalization plan for the electronics and information industry has also been submitted to the National Development and Reform Commission for discussion and has been initially recognized, and is about to become the third batch of industries to be approved. The central government's No.1 document issued at the beginning of the new year once again included agriculture as a positively supported industry, in addition to the promotion of rural markets for home appliances and mobile phones, the promotion of rural markets for cars and agricultural machinery is also underway, and investors have high expectations for the launch of the rural market. In addition, the central bank is gradually implementing a prudent and accommodative monetary policy to increase financial support for the economy. Not only is there a possibility of continued interest rate cuts in the future, but the growth rate of M2, a measure of money supply, has also rebounded significantly: the growth rate in December increased by 3 percentage points to 17.8% from 14.8% in November. The rebound of M2 as a leading indicator of the market and the abundance of market liquidity have provided good external conditions for the market to perform well. Despite the continued deterioration of the fundamentals of the overseas market, the market has received good support at the bottom in the early period, and the short-term stabilization has formed a good external atmosphere for A-shares. So, taking into account the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals, policies, and peripheral market factors, we believe that the market will continue to rise in the short term and may challenge the 2250 point level this week. Given the increased probability of a sharp rise followed by a fall, it is recommended that investors maintain necessary caution and appropriately reduce their positions at the top to avoid the risk of a correction. From a purely technical perspective, the market has shown a breakout with increased volume when facing important technical resistance levels, indicating that the future market trend will continue to develop in depth. From the perspective of the moving average pattern, all the moving average indicators are in a bullish arrangement, and both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indices have firmly stood above the 120-day semi-annual line, and the medium-term technical indicators of the market tend to strengthen. From the wave pattern, the lower track of the current upward channel has climbed to around 2020 points, which will become an important support level for the market after a short-term rebound and decline. And the upper track of the upward channel has reached the 2250 point line. Due to this area being the region of huge volume of trapped shares in the early stage, the market will encounter a large selling pressure at this point, and the probability of short-term rebound and then falling back is increasing. RSI and KDJ in the short and medium term have climbed to a high again, but have not yet reached new highs with the index, indicating a certain decline in the market's buying power, and the technical pressure for a pullback is increasing. Based on the comprehensive technical analysis, we believe that there is a chance to break through the 2250 point level this week, but considering the factors of the economic fundamentals, we still adhere to the operation strategy of reducing positions and taking profits at high levels, and guard against the risk of a rebound after a sharp rise in the short term.

The CSI friends were greatly encouraged by the gush of the outside market. They further filled the gap of October 8 in the morning, opening at 8,619 points, and although the short-term profit-taking and the poor performance of the A-share market in the mainland affected the rise in the middle of the day, the short-term effective digestion was more conducive to the CSI friends to start a new round of rise.

国米收获本该加盟曼城之人意大利杯将实现蓝黑首演？记者彭雷报道本周一18点50，距冬季转会市场结束只剩10分钟，国际米兰技术经理布兰卡终于把帕尔马球员马里加的合同注册到了职业联盟，23岁的肯尼亚中场成为国际米兰这个冬天的最后收购。这是笔意外的收获。事实上，马里加周一的合同本该注册到曼城那里，而国际米兰本想注册的是拉齐奥的莱德斯马或巴勒莫的辛普利西奥的合同，但一个白天发生了很多事。几天来，拉齐奥一直在与国际米兰就莱德斯马的出售问题讨价还价。周一早上的消息是，洛蒂托坚持要1000万欧元或800万欧元加一些年轻球员的租借、所有权等，但国际米兰只希望用800万现金搞定。其实差距不大，但国际米兰并没有等到洛蒂托的电话，因此开始将目标锁定在巴勒莫的巴西中场辛普利西奥身上，布兰卡也开始与赞帕里尼交涉，方式为租借。但巴勒莫希望租借国际米兰的两名年轻球员，进入一队的克尔欣以及青年队的佛萨蒂。周一中午左右，辛普里利奥已经飞到米兰，似乎签约就在眼前。国际米兰此时在询问两名年轻人的意见，但他们都不想离开。于是辛普利西奥加盟国际米兰的道路关闭了，而国际米兰在也洛蒂托依然没有回音的情况下，将目标锁定在马里加身上。几乎确定去曼城投靠曼奇尼的马里加周一上午得到了“无法办下劳工证”的消息，肯尼亚第90名的FIFA排名以及英超的一些官僚程序使马里加去曼城未果。事实上，两年前，朴茨茅斯也因为相关规定没有收购到肯尼亚人，结果被帕尔马150万欧元引入。于是，帕尔马与国际米兰走到了一起，达成了转会协议：250万欧元现金外加价值250万欧元的比亚比亚尼(去年夏天就被租借到帕尔马的前锋)的一半所有权，一起交换马里加的一半所有权。辛普利西奥略带遗憾地留在巴勒莫继续效力，而国际米兰的第一选择莱德斯马则一肚子气，其经纪人迪波利托在转会失败后大吐苦水，“现在彻底完了，一切都晚了。洛蒂托是下午16点才再去联系国际米兰的，可惜人家已经有了新目标。我之前就一直提醒洛蒂托，快没时间了，他出于所谓的自尊、骄傲，就是不给莫拉蒂主席打电话。其实从周六下午国际米兰提出最后的报价后，洛蒂托就基本同意了，他就是想等到最后时刻。结果现在他发现自己犯了错，损失了1000万欧元。现在他正试图将球员卖给曼城或热那亚，但克里斯蒂安(莱德斯马)就是想去国际米兰，所以都拒绝了。继续为拉齐奥踢球？我们再看吧，现在克里斯蒂安的心情差极了，他非常失望。”国际米兰并没有过于失望，老板莫拉蒂表示，“马里加是个惊喜？是吧，他是个年轻人，是个有意思的球员，是未来的希望，我很满意。没有买到莱德斯马？这个世界如果能节省点钱也不是坏事，我只是为球员感到遗憾，但这不是世界末日。”但也有不好的声音，在位于莱科省的莫拉蒂的一处别墅外的栅栏上，有人用油漆写上了“黑人够了！”的种族标语，除了巴洛特利，更是指刚刚收购的这位非洲中场。马里加已被穆里尼奥招入对佛罗伦萨的意大利杯大名单，穆里尼奥表示，“马里加我看到了，他刚刚伤愈，但训练很不错，所以我招他入名单。我是否满意这个收购？是的，我需要一名中场，而且马里加并不是已经成型的球员，他还年轻还在成长，我喜欢这样的球员。”	彭雷,国际米兰,布兰卡,帕尔马,马里加,拉齐奥,莱德斯马,辛普利西奥,洛蒂托,赞帕里尼,克尔欣,佛萨蒂,辛普里利奥,朴茨茅斯,肯尼亚人,比亚比亚尼,迪波利托,莫拉蒂,克里斯蒂安(莱德斯马),克里斯蒂安,巴洛特利,穆里尼奥	正向	"Inter has picked up the man who should have joined City, will the Italian Cup be the debut for the Nerazzurri? Reporter Peng Lei reported that at 6:50 p.m. on Monday, with only 10 minutes left before the winter transfer window closed, Inter Milan's technical manager Branca finally registered Parma player Mariaga's contract with the Professional League. The 23-year-old Kenyan midfielder became Inter Milan's last acquisition of the winter. This is a lucky find. In fact, Mariga's contract on Monday was supposed to be registered with Manchester City, while Inter Milan intended to register Ledesma's or Simplicio's contract from Lazio or Palermo, but a lot happened in a day. For several days, Lazio has been negotiating with Inter over the sale of Ledesma. On Monday morning, Lotti insisted on 10 million euros or 8 million euros plus some young players on loan, ownership, etc., but Inter Milan only wanted to settle for 8 million euros in cash. Actually, the gap was not that big, but Inter did not wait for Lotti's call, so they began to focus on Brazilian midfielder Simplicio of Palermo, and Branca also began to negotiate with Zamparini, in the form of a loan. But Palermo wants to borrow two young players from Inter, Kerchin, who is in the first team, and Fossati, who is in the youth team. Simpriolio had already flown to Milan around noon on Monday, and it seemed that the signing was imminent. Inter Milan is now asking the opinion of two young men, but neither of them wants to leave. So Simplicio's path to Inter was closed, and Inter set their sights on Mariya in the absence of any response from Olittto. Mariga, who was almost certain to join Man City under Mancini, received the news on Monday morning that he could not get a work permit. Mariga’s 90th place in the FIFA ranking and some bureaucratic procedures in the Premier League made it impossible for Mariga to join Man City. In fact, two years ago, Portsmouth was also introduced to a Kenyan by Palermo for 1.5 million euros because it did not acquire a Kenyan in accordance with the relevant regulations. So, Parma and Inter Milan came to an agreement: 2.5 million euros in cash plus half the ownership of Biabiany (who was on loan to Parma last summer) in exchange for half the ownership of Mariaga. Simplicio, with a hint of regret, stayed in Palermo to continue his career, while Ledesma, Inter's first choice, was furious, and his agent Dipolito complained bitterly after the transfer failed, ""It's all over now, it's too late."" Lottin contacted Inter Milan only at 16:00, but unfortunately, they already had a new target. I had been reminding Lotti for a long time that there was no time left, but he refused to call President Moratti out of his so-called pride and self-respect. Actually, from the moment Inter Milan made their final offer on Saturday afternoon, Lotti was basically in agreement, he just wanted to wait until the last moment. Now he finds himself in the wrong, having lost 10 million euros. Now he is trying to sell the player to Manchester City or Genoa, but Christian (Ledesma) wants to go to Inter Milan, so he refused. Continue to play for Lazio? Let's see, now Christian is in a very bad mood, he is very disappointed. Inter was not overly disappointed, said owner Massimo Moratti, ""Mariaga was a surprise?"" Sure, he's a young player, an interesting player, the hope of the future, and I'm very satisfied. Did you not get Ledesma? It is not a bad thing if the world can save some money. I just feel sorry for the players, but it is not the end of the world. But there were also negative voices, with someone painting “Black is enough!” on the fence outside a villa belonging to Moraţiu in Lea County. The racial slogan, in addition to Balotelli, also refers to the African midfielder just acquired. Mariga has been included in the Coppa Italia squad for the match against Fiorentina, and Mourinho said, ""I saw Mariga, he just recovered from an injury, but his training was very good, so I included him in the squad."" Am I satisfied with this acquisition? Yes, I need a midfielder, and Marija is not a finished player, he is still young and growing, and I like such players. """

A ordinary deck of cards, after being randomly shuffled and reshuffled, can be accurately picked out. According to the report (Reporter Wu Shan Li Yi, reporter Wang Xiaobo) Spiao Mingxuan, a fourth-year student at Hubei University, not only earned the nickname ""Little Liu Qian"" among his classmates for his magic performance, but also earned more than 3,000 yuan per month. Shao Mingxuan fell in love with magic seven years ago, in 2003, when a magic show called ""Magic Star"" was broadcast on a satellite TV station, hosted by Liu Qian. I became obsessed with this mysterious game. Not only did he repeatedly practice the small magic tricks taught in the program, but he also began to summarize the same techniques between different magic tricks. After the junior high school entrance examination, he often locked himself in the room and pondered over this mysterious game for several hours continuously. The son's persistent magic dream touched his parents, who found a professional magician to teach him professional magic skills. So, since the beginning of college, every weekend became Shao Mingxuan's ""magic charging period"". With the help of his master, he learned the ""menzi"" (the secrets of magic), made magic props, and played cards, changed roses, changed pigeons, and so on. Whenever there was a gathering among classmates or an activity in the department, ""Shao Mingxuan's magic performance"" became an indispensable part of the event. In 2008, Shao Mingxuan began to perform at fairs with his master during his spare time. I took the money home and gave it to my parents so they would know that I could continue on the path of magic. Shao Mingxuan said. Now, he, still a senior, has become a professional magician under his master’s tutelage, earning 2000-3000 yuan per month to support his own life."

Surge6790 adopts a controversial asymmetric design, with a small arc-shaped protruding part at the lower left corner of the screen to accommodate three commonly used buttons, namely the AT&T shortcut key, menu key, and email button. The Nokia Surge is designed in such a way that the keyboard and screen are not aligned when the phone is closed, and with its heavy body, I personally don't think the appearance is very attractive.

瑞士再保险：香港与内地对保险业态度大相径庭舒时瑞士再保险公司昨天(6月15日)披露了《瑞士再保险2009年亚太区风险取向调查》，结果显示，香港与内地的消费者对保险的取向态度各异。其中香港人更偏爱冒险，而内地消费者则更为保守。瑞士再保险的这份报告针对的是亚太区年龄介乎20至40岁的成年人。其风险取向的结果显示，即使在全球性经济低迷的情况下，大部分香港中小企仍愿意积极借贷以争取业务增长。而且，香港消费者是亚太区内最不愿使用专业财务策划服务的一群；不过，面对甲型H1N1流感的威胁，很多香港受访者表示会检讨他们的保单。为了便于比较不同市场的数据及追踪长远变化，调查结果综合为两个指数，即瑞士再保险亚太区消费者风险取向指数(CAFRI)和中小企风险取向指数(BAFRI)。两个指数越高，均代表越偏好风险。香港人不喜欢用财务策划从消费者风险态度来看，香港消费者的风险取向在亚太区排名第二。调查发现，20至40岁的香港人CAFRI值高达47.8，在受访的八个亚太区市场中风险取向排名第二高，仅次于澳大利亚人。瑞士再保险经济研究及咨询部亚太区主管黄硕辉认为，香港人排名较高的原因在于他们对就业和健康的风险取向较高，在亚太区中排名第二。至于财务和生活方式，香港人较抗拒冒险，在亚太区排在中间位置。此外，调查结果确认，20至30岁的香港男士较愿意冒险。从报告来看，内地的受访者则比较保守，CAFRI值为43.4，排名第六。这部分显示，内地在就业和健康方面仍然处于劣势，并导致消费者在这方面行动较为保守。从财务规划来看，尽管76%的香港受访者非常关注如何保障未来的财务状况，只有54%的受访者表示有具体落实的计划。“香港消费者愿意使用专业财务策划服务的程度在亚太区是最低的，只有17%的受访者认为有必要使用这些服务。”黄硕辉说，“(保险)业界需要付出更多努力，以提高公众对尽早策划财务重要性的意识，并使他们明白合资格的专业理财顾问能助其作出更完善的财务规划。专业理财顾问亦需维持并提升专业水平，以提高公众对他们的信心。金融产品的销售应以顾客的需求为本。”事实上，从雷曼迷你债券和近期曝光的摩根士丹利精明债券事件都表明，香港人对自己的投资决策过于自信。相比之下，有超过20%的内地消费者认可专业财务策划的作用。内地企业家更愿承担风险或许最值得关注的是，这次调查显示，缺乏融资手段的内地企业更愿意承担融资风险。在八个市场的企业调查中，香港中小企对商业风险取向相对较低，BAFRI值只有32.1，在亚太区八个市场中排名第六，仅高于马来西亚和印度。而内地受访者的BAFRI值为35.4，显示出他们更愿意承担商业风险，在亚太区中小企风险取向中名列第二。黄硕辉表示，逾半数以上的内地中小企受访者视目前的金融危机为发展业务的机遇，乐观程度高于香港地区和印度的受访者。相比之下，68%的香港受访者希望透过内部增长而非收购来实现业务扩张，而70%的受访者不愿拓展新产品或业务。不过，异常多的香港(71%)和内地(74%)的中小企受访者表示，如果能有助业务迅速增长，他们非常愿意增加借贷。黄硕辉认为，即使在目前严峻的金融危机压力下，面对业务发展变量增加，作为香港经济增长动力的中小企仍然没有完全放弃业务发展的机会或意愿，这在某程度上反映了政府政策上的支持，能够获取信贷将鼓励中小企提高其财务杠杆水平。黄硕辉没有解释为什么内地企业家的风险承受程度如此之高，但有一点可以肯定，这些企业家并没有像香港中小企业那些获得足够的信贷支持，他们的愿望或许更多反映出内地企业家的融资困难。	舒时,黄硕辉	正向	"Swiss Re: Hong Kong and Mainland China have different attitudes towards the insurance industry Shushih Swiss Re disclosed the ""Swiss Re 2009 Asia Pacific Risk Orientation Survey"" yesterday (June 15), the results of which show that Hong Kong and Mainland China have different attitudes towards insurance. Hong Kong people are more inclined to take risks, while mainland consumers are more conservative. This report by Swiss Re is for adults aged between 20 and 40 in the Asia-Pacific region. The results of its risk orientation show that most Hong Kong SMEs are still willing to actively borrow to seek business growth even in a global economic downturn. And Hong Kong consumers are the least willing to use professional financial planning services in the Asia-Pacific region; however, many Hong Kong respondents said they would review their policies in light of the threat of the H1N1 flu. To facilitate the comparison of data across different markets and track long-term changes, the survey results are consolidated into two indices, the Swiss Re Asia Pacific Consumer Attitudes to Risk Index (CAFRI) and the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Attitudes to Risk Index (BAFRI). The higher the two indices are, the more risk averse they are. Hong Kong people do not like to use financial planning from the perspective of consumer risk attitude, and Hong Kong consumers' risk orientation ranks second in the Asia-Pacific region. The survey found that Hong Kong people aged 20 to 40 had the highest CAFRI value of 47.8 among the eight APL markets surveyed, second only to Australians. The head of Swiss Re's Economic Research and Consulting team in Asia-Pacific, Wong Shuk Fai, believes that the high ranking of Hong Kong people is due to their higher risk appetite for employment and health, ranking second in the Asia-Pacific region. When it comes to finance and lifestyle, Hong Kong people are more resistant to risk and are in the middle of the pack in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the survey results confirmed that Hong Kong men aged 20 to 30 were more willing to take risks. According to the report, the respondents from the mainland were more conservative, with a CAFRI value of 43.4 and ranked sixth. This part shows that the mainland is still at a disadvantage in employment and health, leading to more conservative consumer behavior in these areas. From a financial planning perspective, although 76% of Hong Kong respondents are very concerned about how to secure their future financial situation, only 54% of them have specific plans in place. Hong Kong consumers are the least willing to use professional financial planning services in the Asia-Pacific region, with only 17% of respondents believing it is necessary to use such services. Wong said that the insurance industry needs to make more efforts to raise public awareness of the importance of early financial planning and to help them understand that qualified financial planners can help them make better financial plans. Professional financial advisors also need to maintain and improve their professional standards to enhance public confidence in them. Financial products should be sold based on customers' needs. In fact, the Lehman mini-bonds and the recent exposure of the Morgan Stanley Clever Bonds incident both indicate that Hong Kong people are too confident in their investment decisions. In contrast, more than 20% of consumers on the mainland recognize the role of professional financial planning. It is perhaps most noteworthy that the mainland enterprises are more willing to take risks, and the survey also shows that the mainland enterprises without access to financing are more willing to take financing risks. In the business surveys of eight markets, Hong Kong SMEs have a relatively low orientation to business risks, with a BAFRI value of only 32.1, ranking sixth among the eight markets in the Asia-Pacific region, only higher than Malaysia and India. And the BAFRI value of the respondents from the mainland was 35.4, indicating that they were more willing to take business risks, ranking second in the risk orientation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Shuhui said that more than half of the respondents from the mainland SMEs regarded the current financial crisis as an opportunity for business development, and were more optimistic than those from Hong Kong and India. In contrast, 68% of Hong Kong respondents prefer organic growth over acquisitions to achieve business expansion, while 70% of them are unwilling to expand into new products or businesses. However, a large number of SME respondents in Hong Kong (71%) and Mainland China (74%) said that they would be willing to borrow more if it would help their business to grow quickly. Wong Shuk Fai believes that, even under the current severe financial crisis, in the face of the increase in business development variables, small and medium-sized enterprises, as the driving force of Hong Kong's economic growth, have not completely given up the opportunity or willingness to develop their business, which to some extent reflects the support of government policies, and the ability to obtain credit will encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to increase their financial leverage levels. Although Huang Shuhui did not explain why mainland Chinese entrepreneurs are so risk-tolerant, it is certain that these entrepreneurs have not received sufficient credit support, as have Hong Kong’s small and medium-sized enterprises. Their aspirations may reflect the financing difficulties of mainland Chinese entrepreneurs."

Mobile phones, as a daily communication tool, have gradually integrated into people's lives, and people hope to own a phone that suits themselves. When it comes to buying a mobile phone, some people are after the practical, while others are after the luxury. For example, the current HTC sensation, Samsung GALAXY SII, and other high-end mobile phones are all above 4,000-5,000 yuan, and such models are more suitable for people who have sufficient funds and pursue high-end enjoyment. However, for those who want to experience high-end but have a tight budget, waiting for these models to be discounted is indeed a long process. Fortunately, there are still some models that have been pushed down from the flagship throne in the market, although they have become mid-to-high-end phones, their performance is no less than that, and the price is also relatively reasonable. Like the LGP990, which has a dual-core processor, but is priced similarly to the HTC Desire S (参数报价图片论坛软件) with a single-core processor. So today, I will bring you a few phones with a good price-performance ratio, hoping to provide some help for friends who are buying a phone recently. HTCDesireHD(parameters quotations pictures forum software) Android flagship phones were launched in the second half of 2010, among which HTC Desire HD, with its superior performance, easily occupied an important position in the hearts of consumers.

The number of candidates in Hainan Province will be 25,000. On the 13th, the provincial education department learned that some of the examination sites in Haikou would change. Examinees can collect their admission cards at the registration point three days before the exam. Examinees should arrive early to take the security check. This year's national adult college entrance examination has three levels, that is, high school start to vocational education, high school start to undergraduate and vocational education start to undergraduate. Among them, the subjects of the upgrading from vocational school to university are divided into 8 categories, namely Chinese and traditional Chinese medicine, art, science and engineering, economics and management, law, education, and medicine. The unified examination subjects for upgrading from vocational school to university are politics, English, and professional basic courses. The subjects for the college entrance examination for high school graduates applying for undergraduate programs are four subjects, namely Chinese, mathematics (literary or scientific), foreign language, and history and geography or physics and chemistry; the subjects for the college entrance examination for high school graduates applying for junior college programs are four subjects, namely Chinese, mathematics (literary or scientific), foreign language, and civic morality and legal foundation. The Provincial Department of Education has required all the examination centers in each county and city to strictly enforce the examination discipline. Examinations and examination rooms are under closed management. During the examination period, no irrelevant personnel are allowed to enter the examination site and the examination room. Examiners must strictly check and compare the identity card, admission ticket, and the photo of the examinee with the photo on the seat list when the examinees enter the examination room, to prevent the occurrence of proxy examination. To prevent and block cheating behaviors such as ""carrying"" and ""using wireless communication devices"" during the examination period, all cities and counties will take security checks for candidates entering the examination hall this year, and the invigilators will use ""hand-held metal detectors"" to conduct a full-body check on the candidates. The Provincial Department of Education requires that each city and county must train and drill candidates for security checks at the entrance. During the examination period, each examination site must set up inspection posts at the entrance of the teaching building and at the entrance of the examination room, and strictly follow the operating procedures to conduct body searches on candidates to prevent candidates from bringing prohibited items into the examination room. Careful work should be done to rotate the invigilators for the examination sessions. Rotating assignments are randomly arranged by provincial inspection officers and announced 60 minutes before the exam starts. Proctors shall not refuse to carry out the assignments for any reason. The ""School Safety Project"" has brought about new changes in the location of individual examination sites. There are a total of 8 examination sites and 380 examination rooms in Haikou examination area. The examination center of Haikou City reminds candidates that due to some schools implementing the school safety project, the location of some examination sites has changed compared to previous years. It is advised that candidates visit the examination sites in advance to confirm and familiarize themselves with the location. There are 8 examination sites: 1. Haikou Qiaozhong High School (No. 59 Haixiu Avenue), where the management and economics and law classes take the exam for the college entrance examination; 2. Haikou Experimental High School (No. 1 Beilong North Road, original site of Haikou Travel Vocational School), where the humanities and literature classes for the high school entrance examination take the exam; 3. Haikou Experimental High School Junior High School (Haidian West Road 5), where the science and engineering classes for the high school entrance examination take the exam; 4. Haikou No. 4 High School (Meyuan Road, next to Haikou Public Security Bureau of Meilan), where the Chinese, traditional Chinese medicine, education, agriculture and medicine classes for the college entrance examination take the exam; 5. Haikou No. 2 High School (No. 18 Haiyin East Road, Haiyin East Road), where the humanities, science and engineering, and arts classes for the high school entrance examination take the exam; 6. Haikou No. 9 High School (No. 26 Haixiu East Road), where the science and engineering and sports classes for the high school entrance examination take the exam; 7. Haikou No. 10 High School (No. 12 Peace South Road), where the arts and science and engineering classes for the college entrance examination take the exam; 8. Fucheng High School (No. 10 Zhongshan South Road, Fucheng), where the humanities and arts and engineering classes for the high school entrance examination take the exam. This year, a total of 11,162 people in Haikou took the exam, including 4,456 people for upgrading from vocational school to university, 1,516 people for upgrading from high school to university, and 5,145 people for upgrading from high school to vocational school."
高考评论：考生大幅“跳水”是个好现象今日关键词考生锐减这种现象是好事，它使“千军万马争过独木桥”现象得到缓解的同时，向全国高校发布了一个明确信息：今后，依靠垄断生源这一优势过优哉游哉的好日子，越来越不可靠了。□本报评论员岳建国今年，河南高考报名总人数85.5万人，比去年95.2万人锐减近10万人，是有史以来“跳水”幅度最大的一次。对此，省招办新闻发言人陈大琪表示，这是因为今年新课改后高考第一年，复读生比往年少了，其次是职业教育分流和人口出生的自然增减，这意味着河南考生上大学将更容易。另据业内人士分析，部分高校将因生源逐渐枯竭面临严峻生存挑战。高考报名人数出现有史以来最大幅度的“跳水”，其原因并不止上述几个，只要回顾一下我们周围的高中生的去向，就会发现还应加上“高中生直接就业和出国留学者增多”这两个因素，虽然我们没有权威的统计资料作支持。总的来说，这种现象是好事，除了考生上大学更容易外，它还使曾令我们震惊、心焦和无奈的“千军万马争过独木桥”的现象得到明显缓解，同时向全国各高校发布了一个明确的信息：今后高校必须越来越依赖教学质量、就业率和成才率而生存，依靠垄断生源这一优势耍大牌、优哉游哉的好日子，越来越不可靠了。1999年以来的高招形势是，高校盲目扩招，人口出生却自然增减，导致录取比例大幅提高，许多省份的录取率高达80%。与这个“招生大跃进”相对应的是，大批从农村进入高校的大学生“毕业即失业”，他们既不想辜负家乡父老“跳出农门”的期望，又因学无所长和没有“好”父母而无法找到满意的工作，于是便成了“蜗居”在大中城市城乡接合部的庞大“蚁族”。这种现象产生了很大的效应——导致越来越多的高中生决定另辟蹊径。比如家庭稍微好一些的高中生干脆出国留学，接受更好的教育；有的高中生尤其是农村的，干脆跟随亲朋好友到城市打工，自食其力；有的走进职业学校，将来做一个体面的技术工人。于是，全国范围的“高考报名人数逐年锐减甚至‘跳水’”的现象出现了。但这并不是坏事，是开放的环境和市场经济为考生们提供了更多的选择。想想看，普通家庭节衣缩食攒钱把孩子送到外国留学，让祖国的接班人眼界更开阔、能力更强，这不是再好不过的事情吗？过去我们一直说发达国家都很重视职业教育，美国的大学录取率才达到70%左右，我们不也是朝着这条路走吗？目前，全国各地的民营企业几乎都面临着招工难现象，高中生就业不是可以解燃眉之急吗？但是，这一现象肯定会让许多高校感到不安甚至产生压力。许多年来，他们有的大建新校区，有的大扩老校区，以便增加专业，增加班级。可他们没有想到的是，自己的招生规模刚刚扩大，突然生源就减少了，看着空荡荡的偌大校区，心里能不着急吗？但从如何提高高校教学质量这方面看，这是好事，这能让他们感觉到，无论是出国的还是到民企就业的，都是嫌他们教学质量差，都是对他们的失望和抛弃，都在逼他们猛醒、改革，向一流高校看齐，促使高校之间出现有效的竞争，最终导致中国高校教学质量的整体提高。	岳建国,陈大琪	正向	"College Entrance Examination Comment: A Large Number of Candidates ""Diving"" Is a Good Phenomenon Today's Keyword: A Sharp Reduction in Candidates This Phenomenon Is a Good Thing, It Relieves the Phenomenon of ""Ten Thousand Soldiers Competing for a Single Bridge"" and Sends a Clear Message to All National Universities: In the Future, the Good Days of Enjoying the Advantage of Monopoly of Students Are Getting Less and Less Reliable. □The reporter of the newspaper, Yue Jianguo, this year, the total number of people registered for the college entrance examination in Henan Province is 855,000, which is nearly 100,000 less than last year's 952,000, which is the largest ""dive"" in history. Regarding this, Chen Dazhi, a spokesperson for the provincial admissions office, said that this was because this year was the first year of the new curriculum reform, and the number of college students was less than in previous years. Secondly, it was due to the natural increase and decrease in population and the分流of vocational education, which means that it will be easier for Henan students to go to college. According to insiders, some universities will face severe survival challenges due to the gradual depletion of their student sources. The number of candidates for the college entrance examination has experienced the largest drop in history, and the reasons are not limited to the above. If we look back at the destinations of high school students around us, we will find that we should add ""an increasing number of high school students are directly employed and studying abroad"" to the above factors, although we do not have authoritative statistical data to support it. Overall, this phenomenon is a good thing, not only making it easier for candidates to go to university, but also significantly alleviating the phenomenon that once shocked, worried, and frustrated us, ""ten thousand soldiers competing for a single bridge"", and at the same time sending a clear message to universities across the country: in the future, universities must rely more and more on teaching quality, employment rate and talent cultivation rate to survive, and the good days of relying on the monopoly of source and playing it easy are becoming less and less reliable. Since the high enrollment trend in 1999, colleges and universities have blindly expanded enrollment, while the population birth has naturally increased and decreased, leading to a significant increase in the admission ratio, with admission rates as high as 80% in many provinces. Corresponding to this ""massive enrollment drive"" was a large number of college graduates from rural areas who were unemployed after graduation, who did not want to let down the expectations of their hometown elders for them to ""escape the countryside"", and who could not find satisfactory jobs due to their lack of skills and good parents, thus becoming a huge ""ant tribe"" living in the urban-rural fringe areas of large and medium-sized cities. This phenomenon has had a great effect – leading to an increasing number of high school students choosing an alternative path. For example, high school students from better-off families go abroad for further education; some high school students, especially those from rural areas, go to the city to work with their relatives and friends, relying on their own efforts; some enter vocational schools and will become decent technical workers in the future. Thus, the phenomenon of a sharp decline in the number of people registering for the national college entrance examination, even a “plunge,” appeared. But this is not a bad thing, as an open environment and market economy have provided candidates with more choices. Think about it, ordinary families save up their money to send their children to study abroad, so that the successors of the motherland can have a broader perspective and stronger abilities. Isn't this the best thing? In the past, we always said that developed countries attach great importance to vocational education, and the college admission rate in the United States is only about 70%. Are we not also going down this road? Currently, almost all private enterprises across the country are facing the problem of difficulty in recruitment. Is it a solution to the immediate problem for high school graduates to find jobs? But this phenomenon is bound to unsettle, if not put pressure on, many universities. For many years, some of them have built new campuses and expanded old ones to increase majors and classes. But they did not expect that, just as their enrollment scale had expanded, the number of students suddenly decreased. Looking at the vast and empty campus, could they not be anxious? But from the perspective of improving the quality of higher education, it is a good thing, as it makes them feel that whether they go abroad or work in private enterprises, they are all dissatisfied with the quality of their teaching, and are abandoning them, forcing them to wake up and reform, to catch up with first-class universities, to promote effective competition among universities, and ultimately lead to a general improvement in the quality of teaching in Chinese universities."
QDII队伍壮大上半年有望达到40只证券时报记者余子君今年合格境内机构投资者(QDII)发行提速，截至昨日，已经成立了10只QDII，算上正在发行和即将发行的QDII，上半年QDII有望冲击40只大关。天相投顾数据显示，截至昨日，今年已经成立的QDII达到37只，华安大中华升级基金也于4月18日开始募集，按一个月的募集期限计算，该基金将于近期结束募集。除此之外，日前获批的广发标普全球农业指数基金也将于近期发行。而富国基金于去年11月15日上报了全球顶级消费品股票型基金，按照6个月的审批流程计算，如果该基金获批后立即投入发行，上半年，QDII基金只数将达到40只。事实上，从证监会公布的基金募集申请核准进度公示表来看，除了广发标普全球农业指数基金和富国全球顶级消费品股票型基金之外，还有7只QDII已经递交了申请材料，正在等待获批。2009年底QDII审批重启之后，基金公司发行热情高涨，今年发行更加火爆。截至昨日，今年以来已经成立了10只QDII产品，还有1只正在发行，1只即将发行，8只QDII已经递交募集申请，等待获批。而去年全年共计成立了18只QDII，其中上半年成立7只，下半年成立11只。从基金公司角度来看，目前已经拥有QDII产品的基金公司达到27家，占比近半。其中，博时、南方、易方达和嘉实等大型基金公司已经拥有2只QDII产品。如果算上即将发行和已经递交了募集申请材料的基金公司，那么嘉实和南方2家基金公司即将迎来旗下第3只QDII产品，诺安、广发、汇添富、富国、国泰4家基金公司也将拥有2只QDII产品，而景顺长城和国海富兰克林基金公司也将迎来旗下首只QDII产品。从产品特点来看，与首批出海的QDII相比，近两年，基金公司更注重产品创新。如专注黄金投资的诺安黄金以及易方达黄金基金、专注全球债券市场的富国全球债券基金、专注指数化投资的国泰纳斯达克100指数基金、嘉实恒生H股、大成标普500、长信标普100、广发标普全球农业指数基金等。除此之外，诺安基金今年还上报了国内首只油气能源基金。基金业内人士指出，2008年下半年QDII审批一度被暂停，2009年底审批放开后，基金公司为了完善产品线，发行QDII产品热情大增，目前大型基金公司基本拥有2只QDII产品，少数仅拥有1只QDII产品的大型基金公司也在加紧筹备第2只产品。上海一家基金公司人士表示，虽然QDII发行如火如荼，但是，由于QDII业务运作成本比较高，目前不少基金公司都是亏本运作，对于中小型基金公司来说，如果不是为了完善产品线，发行动力并不足。已经拥有2只QDII产品基金公司一览基金公司名称一季度末含联接基金资产管理规模(亿元)公司成立时间博时基金1135.771998－7－13工银瑞信554.632005－6－21海富通基金416.762003－4－18华宝兴业基金423.402003－3－7嘉实基金1506.301999－3－25南方基金1171.361998－3－6上投摩根基金556.262004－5－12易方达基金1589.132001－4－17银华基金786.442001－5－28招商基金390.402002－12－27数据来源：天相投顾余子君／制表	余子君	正向	The QDII team has grown and is expected to reach 40 by the end of the first half of the year. The Securities Times reporter Yu Zijun. This year, the issuance of Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDII) has accelerated. As of yesterday, 10 QDII have already been established. Including QDII that are currently being issued and will be issued, QDII is expected to reach 40 by the end of the first half of the year. According to Tianxiang Investment Advisor, as of yesterday, there are 37 QDII funds established this year, and the Huataan Greater China Upgrade Fund also started fundraising on April 18. Calculating with a one-month fundraising period, the fund will end fundraising in the near future. In addition, the recently approved GSF Standard & Poor's Global Agriculture Index Fund will also be issued in the near future. And Fuguo Fund submitted a global top consumer stock fund on November 15 last year. Calculating the 6-month approval process, if the fund is issued immediately after approval, the number of QDII funds in the first half of the year will reach 40. In fact, according to the progress disclosure table of the CSRC's approved fund fundraising applications, apart from the GFF S&P Global Agriculture Index Fund and the Fidelity Global Top Consumer Goods Fund, there are still 7 QDII that have submitted application materials and are waiting for approval. After the resumption of QDII approval at the end of 2009, fund companies were enthusiastic about issuing, and the issuance this year is even more enthusiastic. As of yesterday, 10 QDII products have been established this year, one is being issued, one is about to be issued, and 8 QDII have submitted fundraising applications and are waiting for approval. And a total of 18 QDII were established last year, with 7 established in the first half and 11 in the second half. From the perspective of the fund company, there are currently 27 fund companies that have QDII products, accounting for nearly half. Among them, large fund companies such as BT, Nanshan, Yi Fangda and Jashi already have 2 QDII products. If you count the fund companies that are about to issue and have already submitted QDII fundraising applications, then Jash and Nandong will welcome their third QDII products, and Nono, Guofa, Huatiefu, Fuguo, and Guotai will also have two QDII products. Jingzhen Changcheng and Guhafulanqin fund companies will also welcome their first QDII products. In terms of product features, compared with the first batch of QDII that went overseas, in the past two years, fund companies have paid more attention to product innovation. Such as Nu'an Gold and Yi Fangda Gold Fund, which focus on gold investment, Fidelity Global Bond Fund, which focuses on the global bond market, GTAM Nasdaq 100 Index Fund, which focuses on index investment, Jashen Hang Seng H-share, Dacheng S&P 500, Changxin S&P 100, and Guangfa S&P Global Agriculture Index Fund, etc. In addition, Nuon An Fund also reported the first domestic oil and gas energy fund in China this year. Industry insiders pointed out that QDII approval was once suspended in the second half of 2008, and after the approval was released at the end of 2009, fund companies issued QDII products with great enthusiasm to improve their product lines. Currently, large fund companies basically have 2 QDII products, and some large fund companies that only have 1 QDII product are also accelerating the preparation of the second product. An insider of a fund company in Shanghai said that although QDII issuance was booming, due to the high operation cost of QDII business, many fund companies were operating at a loss at present. For small and medium-sized fund companies, if not to improve the product line, the motivation to launch was not strong.

新大洲：被严重忽视的新能源电池概念方正证券赵玉涛继新能源电池板块中一线品种杉杉股份、西藏矿业、科力远等连续飙升、富贵逼人之后，今日该板块中的二三线品种中金瑞科技、佛塑股份等品种强势涨停，再度将市场人气充分激活！受其刺激，中信国安、中国宝安、福田汽车等相关新能源电池产业链受益品种亦以长阳报收。回顾近期盘面，新能源电池板块中诸如西藏矿业、杉杉股份、中信国安、中国宝安等品种无不演绎新能源电池的造福神话。可以说，一时间新能源电池风起云涌、黑马奔腾！独无有偶，此前针对奥巴马胜选的期望，让美国能源巨头FirstSolarInc.(FSLR)股价大涨。显然，一股新能源电池热正在全球股市掀起，其背后推动力正是美国新总统奥巴马推出未来十年1500亿美元新能源计划。因此，可以说新能源电池的市场前景超出想象，相关上市公司无疑将面临重大的投资机遇。此外，新能源电池板块经过一轮狂飙，整体估值得以全线大幅提升，给新能源电池相关品种带来极大的投资机会，尤其是一些未被市场所发掘的二三线品种，像今天强势涨停的金瑞科技和佛塑股份，就是最典型的例证！因此，我们认为，一直未有表现的同类品种新大洲(000571)值得投资者重点关注！资料显示，新大洲(000571)参股的大连新源动力是中国燃料电池领域规模最大的企业，在国内率先实现了燃料电池实验室科研成果向现实生产力的转化，由新源动力等单位提供动力系统的帕萨特领驭氢燃料电池轿车已经作为公务用车在奥运中心区进行了示范运营；同时，新大洲(000571)旗下的上海新大洲电动车有限公司专业进行电动自行车的研发、制造和销售。那么，在新能源电池板块中一线品种全线大幅飙升、二三线品种黑马奔腾的大背景下，新能源动力领域题材非常正宗和丰富的新大洲(000571)无疑被市场严重忽视，相信该股必将复制前述同类品种所连续涨停的神话！奥巴马发力新能源突破口在燃料电池事实上，自参选之日起，奥巴马就显示出对新能源产业的极大关注。产业政策中对新能源做出了极大倾斜，未来十年将投入1500亿美元资助替代能源的研究，并为相关公司提供税务优惠；发展清洁能源，大幅减少对中东和委内瑞拉石油的依赖；计划到2012年，美国发电量的10%将来自可再生能源等。其中，奥巴马对新能源汽车的青睐尤为引人注目，目前盛传将采用混合动力凯迪拉克作为白宫座驾。奥巴马在竞选时承诺，计划以7000美元的抵税额度鼓励消费者购买节能型汽车；动用40亿美元的联邦政府资金支持汽车公司推进新能源车的销售，到2015年使美国的混合动力汽车销量达到100万辆。显然，奥巴马未来能源计划中的核心焦点，就集中在新能源动力汽车。资料显示，燃料电池是举世公认的高效、便捷及有益于环境的绿色能源装置。它利用氢和氧生成水的过程来产生电力的一种装置。所依据的原理，是中学课程中“水的电解”反应的逆反应。因为是将燃料通过化学反应释放出能量变为电能输出，所以被称为“燃料电池”。目前广泛研发的燃料电池有质子交换膜燃料电池(PEMFC)、直接甲醇燃料电池(DMFC)、碱性燃料电池(AFC)等。其中，质子交换膜燃料电池(PEMFC)因其不经过燃烧直接以电化学反应连续地把燃料和氧化剂中的化学能直接转换成电能，具有能量转换效率高(一般都在40%～50%，而内燃机仅为18%～24%)、无污染、启动快、电池寿命长、比功率、比能量高等优点，成为应用最广的一类燃料电池。该技术已被美国、加拿大等发达国家认定为21世纪首选的清洁能源系统。	赵玉涛,奥巴马	正向	"New Dazhou: A Neglected New Energy Battery Concept. Zhaoyutao, a securities researcher from Zhongzeng Securities, after the first-tier varieties of new energy batteries, such as杉杉股份, Tibet Mining, and Keliyuan, have been continuously soaring and becoming rich, today, the second and third-tier varieties in the new energy battery sector, such as Zhongjinrui Technology and Foshu Share, have been strongly closed, and have once again fully activated the market enthusiasm! Stimulated by this, related varieties of the new energy battery industry chain, such as China CITIC Security, China Baoan, and Fufeng Automobile, also closed with long阳. Looking back at the recent trading, varieties such as Tibet Mining,杉杉股份, CITIC National Security, and China Baowu in the new energy battery sector have all played out the miracle of new energy battery benefits. One can say that for a while, new energy batteries were in full swing, with black horses galloping! There is no pair, the expectation of Obama's victory before this, has made the stock price of the US energy giant First Solar Inc. (FSLR) rise sharply. Clearly, a new wave of enthusiasm for new energy batteries is sweeping the global stock market, and the driving force behind it is the US new president Obama's 150 billion US dollar new energy plan for the next ten years. Thus, it can be said that the market prospects of new energy batteries are beyond imagination, and related listed companies are bound to face significant investment opportunities. In addition, the new energy battery sector has experienced a round of frenzied growth, and the overall valuation has been significantly increased, bringing great investment opportunities to new energy battery-related varieties, especially some second and third-tier varieties that have not been discovered by the market, such as Jinrui Technology and Foshan Plastic Corporation, which have been strongly closed today, are typical examples! Therefore, we believe that the new Dazhou (000571) of the same variety, which has not performed well, is worthy of investors' close attention! Records show that Dalian Xinyuan Power, in which Xinda (000571) has a stake, is the largest enterprise in the field of fuel cells in China. It was the first to convert the laboratory research results of fuel cells into real productive forces in China. The Passat Lingyu hydrogen fuel cell sedan provided by Xinyuan Power and other units has been put into demonstration operation as a public service vehicle in the Olympic Center area. At the same time, Shanghai Xinda Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Xinda (000571), specializes in the research, manufacturing and sales of electric bicycles. Given that the first-tier varieties in the new energy battery sector have surged significantly, and the second and third-tier varieties have shown strong performance, the new and authentic theme of new energy power in Xin Da Zou (000571) has been seriously overlooked by the market. It is believed that this stock will replicate the神话of consecutive涨停of similar varieties! Obama's efforts in new energy will break through in fuel cells.In fact, since he began his campaign, Obama has shown great concern for the new energy industry. There is a great tilt in industrial policy towards new energy, and 150 billion US dollars will be invested in the next ten years to support the research of alternative energy, and tax incentives will be provided for related companies; develop clean energy, and reduce dependence on oil from the Middle East and Venezuela; it is planned that 10% of the power generation in the United States in 2012 will come from renewable energy. Among them, Obama's preference for new energy vehicles is particularly eye-catching, and it is currently rumored that a hybrid Cadillac will be used as the official car of the White House. Obama promised during his campaign to encourage consumers to buy energy-efficient cars with a tax credit of $7,000, to use $4 billion in federal funds to support the auto industry in promoting the sale of new energy vehicles, and to reach 1 million hybrid cars in the United States by 2015. Clearly, the core focus of Obama's future energy plan is on new energy-powered cars. Records show that fuel cells are recognized worldwide as efficient, convenient, and environmentally friendly green energy devices. It is a device that generates electricity by using hydrogen and oxygen to produce water. The principle is the reverse reaction of the electrolysis of water in the middle school curriculum. Because the fuel is converted into electrical energy through a chemical reaction and then output, it is called a ""fuel cell"". Currently, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), alkaline fuel cells (AFC), and other fuel cells are widely researched and developed. Among them, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have the advantages of high energy conversion efficiency (generally 40%~50%, while the internal combustion engine is only 18%~24%), no pollution, fast start-up, long battery life, high specific power, specific energy, etc., because they directly convert the chemical energy in fuel and oxidant into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions without going through combustion, and have become the most widely used type of fuel cell. This technology has been recognized by developed countries such as the United States and Canada as the preferred clean energy system of the 21st century."
经验交流：司法考试是一个斗智斗勇的过程我是第一年参加司法考试，今年考了434分。我觉得司法考试是一个斗智斗勇的过程，现在我把我的一些体会分三个阶段与大家一起分享！我是从三月中旬开始准备的，因为是第一次考，心理没有底，所以准备比较早。那时也是摸着石头过河，脑海里对考试的内容都没有一个系统的体系，有点觉得胡子眉毛一把抓，也许是以前的功底还不错，有时觉得有些意想不到的效果，就这么样混混沌沌的一个半月过去了。这时朋友建议我去报个班，可能对我有帮助，我报了一个周末和晚上上课的班，可以自由安排时间，哪天学累了可以自主决定休息，就这么样我跟着老师的进度学习。在老师的引导下，学习效率大大提高，有些不懂的地方也迎刃而解，学得如鱼得水！今年的卷三得了122分。第二阶段是7月到8月了，这段时间离考试不到三个月了，马上就要开奥运会了，前一段时间去找自习室，折腾了几个星期，挪来挪去，学习计划一度被打乱，最远的还去过海淀图书馆，可离住的地方实在太远，花在坐车的时间来回也得4个小时，太不划算了，大热天，心里更加烦躁，想来想去，只有回家看书了，在老家呆在自己的房间里，虽然安静，可没有人与我交流，我只有每天发短信或者上网与司考同路人交流，这么样就可以知道他们的进度，看看自己有没有落后，哪个知识点掌握的不好，每天只规定自己看六个小时，但必须要有效率，剩下的时间奖励自己看奥运比赛，基本比较重要的比赛我都没有落过。第三阶段就到就9月了，回到北京我就开始把从03到07真题认认真真地做了一遍，把做错的地方找找相关的知识再看看。剩下的时间把论述稍微看了一下，我是觉得第四卷没有必要下工夫，因为如果把前三卷的基本功打好了，第四卷基本上没有太大的问题，只要做到卷面干净，字迹清楚就可以了！俗话说：台下十年工，台上一分钟。临场发挥也很重要，这个时候比的是心理素质了。我还是比较紧张的，卷二刚刚发下来，就听见老师说有人卷一没有用A4铅笔填准考证号，我猛然发现自己就没有填，心理老想着会不会卷一作废，所以考卷二时心里有杂念，怪自己的粗心大意，结果卷二考得有点失常，刑诉错得有点离谱，考完后结果是虚惊一场，监考老师说就是没有填准考证号他们也帮填了，晚上一直懊悔卷二考砸了，但想也没有用了，只有在下面的考试中挽回局面，提起精神把第二天的要考的好好看看一下，结果第二天很快就调整过来了，写得很顺手！今年在司法考试上算是圆满结局了，但往后的法律路还很漫长，得不断学习！不断进取！路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索！更多信息请访问：新浪司法频道司法考试论坛司法考试博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。		正向	Experience exchange: The judicial examination is a process of wit and courage. I participated in the judicial examination for the first time this year and scored 434 points. I think the judicial examination is a process of fighting with intelligence and courage. Now I will share my experience in three stages with you all! I started preparing from mid-March, because it was my first time taking the exam, and I didn't have much confidence, so I started preparing early. Then we were also feeling our way across the river, with no systematic framework in mind for the content of the exam. Sometimes it felt like we were grabbing at straws. Perhaps our foundation was still quite good, and sometimes we got some unexpected results. In this way, the hazy two and a half months passed. Then a friend suggested that I sign up for a class, which might be helpful to me. I signed up for a class that meets on weekends and evenings, which can be arranged freely. I can decide to rest on my own when I am tired. In this way, I learn at the pace of the teacher. With the guidance of the teacher, the learning efficiency has greatly improved, and some places that were not understood were solved effortlessly, learning like a fish in water! This year's卷三 scored 122 points. The second stage was from July to August, which was less than three months away from the exam, and the Olympics was about to start. In the previous period, I went to look for a study room, and it took several weeks to move around, and my study plan was once disrupted. I had even gone to the Haidian Library, but it was too far from my place, and it took 4 hours to go back and forth by bus, which was not worth it. In the hot weather, I was even more irritable. After thinking and thinking, I could only read at home. Although it was quiet in my room at home, there was no one to communicate with me. I could only send text messages or surf the Internet to communicate with the bar exam companions every day. In this way, I could know their progress, see if I was lagging behind, and see which knowledge points I did not master well. Every day, I only stipulated that I should read for six hours, but I must be efficient. The rest of the time was rewarded to watch the Olympic games. I basically did not miss any important games. In the third stage, it was September. After I returned to Beijing, I did the real questions from 2003 to 2007 carefully, and found the relevant knowledge and looked at the places where I made mistakes. I just briefly looked at the rest of the time, I think the fourth volume is not necessary to put in too much effort, because if the basic skills of the first three volumes are well done, the fourth volume basically has no big problem, as long as it can be clean and clear handwriting! As the saying goes, ten years of work off the stage for one minute on the stage. Impromptu performance is also important, and at this time, it's about psychological quality. I was still a bit nervous. The second volume just came out, and I heard the teacher say that someone did not use an A4 pencil to fill in the admission number in the first volume. I suddenly realized that I did not fill it in. I kept thinking whether the first volume would be invalid, so I had杂念 in my mind when I took the second volume, blaming my carelessness. As a result, I performed abnormally in the second volume, and the criminal procedure was a bit off. After the exam, it turned out to be a false alarm. The invigilator said that they also filled it in for those who did not fill in the admission number. I was very regretful that I had failed the second volume, but I thought it was useless, and I could only try to turn the situation around in the next exam. I picked up my spirits and looked at the subjects I would take the next day. As a result, I adjusted quickly the next day and wrote very smoothly! This year's judicial examination can be considered a satisfactory conclusion, but the road of law in the future is still long, and continuous learning is needed! Keep moving forward! The journey is long and arduous, but I will continue to seek and explore! For more information, please visit the legal channel of Sina.com, legal examination forum, legal examination blog circle.

电信系广电系内部融合加速电信系广电系内部融合加速统一监管或成三网融合制度基础■本报记者沈加军2月6日，中国电信的“家庭信息第四屏——魔屏mTouch”在上海国美徐汇店上柜露面，“魔屏mTouch”采用八英寸显示屏，集合了手机、电视以及电脑三屏优势，。也是在上周，据中国有线电视网络有限公司透露，有线电视网省内整合已彻底完成的省份达到13个，同时有10个省份正在推进此项工作。单独看两方面各自的融合速度，不可谓不大，但是，整个中国的三网融合进程缺只能用缓慢来标注。难题仍然是原来的难题，行业老专家舒华英一语道破，实现三网融合首先要探讨统一监管问题。统一监管机构是三网融合的制度基础从过来的三网融合经验可看出，设立融合管制机构，对网络实行统一监管都是三网融合实现突破的基础，典型国家包括英国、美国、加拿大、日本等。2003年英国依据《2003年通信法》设立了融合性的监管机构OFCOM?英国通信管理局，彻底打破了原来信息领域中存在的各种壁垒，使技术和业务得到进一步融合。而美国监管机构FCC?联邦通信委员会本来就是一个融合性监管机构，其监管范围包括公共电信、专用电信、广播电视等。日本在总务省下面设立了信息通信政策局和综合通信基础局，同时监管电信和广播业。但在国内，由于面临利益和政策上的障碍，迟迟无法取得突破。舒华英教授表示，由于广电与电信分属于两个不同的部门管理，因此三网融合中的部门利益协调依然是一个大难题，广电和电信之间壁垒森严的难题未解决的直接后果就是已经争论了十几年的三网融合问题将被无限期搁浅。因此，要真正实现三网融合，信息服务业、通信、广播以及借助网络的新兴媒体等需要更高层面的监管机构来行使监管职权。应该建立国家信息监管委员会，利用这一监管平台进行单纯监管，实现政企分离。相互准入实现市场化运营是前提在三网融合的实践上来看，目前多数国家直接允许相互进入。英国立法明确规定准许传统广电和电信双向进入，同时对电信业采取竞争开放的监管办法，对广电业的准入相对严格一些。德国和印度两国的电信企业在提供融合性服务上已经不存在法律障碍。三网融合的发展要充分发挥市场机制的作用，市场机制是推进三网融合的前提。从国内实际来看，三网融合确实改变了广电与电信相互隔离的外部关系，但双方各自独立的内在特性依然存在。但是三网融合发展趋势不可逆转，尤其在当前金融危机的背景下，三网融合需求显得更为迫切。虽然广电一直在推进改革，但是不时也传出广电“既做运动员，又做裁判员”等不符合市场经济规律的事件，黄石广电叫停IPTV、莆田广电强推数字电视等可见一斑。广电方面应加快市场化改革的步伐，广电本身实现“制播分离”，即内容和传输分离是比较可行的办法，三网融合也就水到渠成了。三网融合超越一切利益之争目前全球经济的复苏主要得益于各国经济刺激方案的短期作用。国家的一系列内政措施，都与拉动内需、创造新经济增长点有关。发放3G牌照、加速三网融合，都是按这方向走棋，是超越集团利益之上的决策。站在这个立场上，就不难理解国家所订下的紧迫的融合时间表。三网融合对广播电视网来说极其艰难，广播电视网目前是全国四级(省地市县)各自独立为政格局，网络统一首先必须体制改革，从行政事业部门分离出来，建立企业管理模式。亦即脱离广电局成立独立的网络集团，组成“第四网络运营商”，参与网络产业竞争。对电信业来说，当前内容瓶颈仍然是制约通信业进一步发展的关键，尤其是没有“播放”和“播控”的权力。而在制作内容上，电信业其实也是门外汉。对于电信业而言，最贴切的一句话就是“强化全IP化网络改造，完善全业务运营能力，整合个人、家庭、企业和垂直领域的业务提供能力。”但是这些都不足以阻挡中国三网融合的必然趋势，现在看来，市场化机制的形成并非一日之功，国家意志层面的统一监管需要首先成行。	沈加军,舒华英	正向	"Telecommunications and broadcasting systems internal integration acceleration Telecommunications and broadcasting systems internal integration acceleration, unified supervision or become the basis of three networks integration system ■Reporter Shen Jiajun On February 6, China Telecom's ""Family Information Fourth Screen - Magic Screen mTouch"" was unveiled at the Xuhui store of Gome in Shanghai, ""Magic Screen mTouch"" uses an 8-inch display, integrating the advantages of mobile phones, TV and computers. Last week, according to China Central Television, 13 provinces have completed the provincial integration of cable TV networks, while 10 provinces are advancing with the work. When viewed separately, the speed of the integration of the two aspects is not small, but the entire process of three-network integration in China can only be described as slow. The difficult problem is still the original difficult problem. The old expert in the industry, Shuhua Ying, revealed it in one sentence: to achieve the integration of three networks, the first thing to discuss is the issue of unified supervision. Unified regulatory bodies are the institutional foundation of the convergence of three networks. From the experience of the convergence of three networks in the past, setting up a converged regulatory body and implementing unified regulation of networks are the foundations for the breakthrough of the convergence of three networks, and typical countries include the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan, etc. In 2003, the United Kingdom established a converged regulatory body, OFCOM, based on the 2003 Communications Act, which completely broke down the various barriers that existed in the information sector, allowing technology and business to be further integrated. And the FCC, Federal Communications Commission, which is a convergence regulator in the United States, originally regulated public telecommunications, dedicated telecommunications, broadcasting, and television. Japan established the Information and Communications Policy Bureau and the Integrated Communications Bureau under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and also regulates the telecommunications and broadcasting industries. But in China, progress has been slow due to obstacles related to interests and policies. Prof. Shuhua Ying said that the coordination of departmental interests in the integration of the three networks is still a big problem, because the radio and television and telecommunications are managed by two different departments. The direct consequence of the unresolved problem of the strict barriers between radio and television and telecommunications is that the problem of the integration of the three networks, which has been debated for more than ten years, will be indefinitely shelved. Therefore, to truly achieve the convergence of the three networks, the information industry, telecommunications, broadcasting, and new media that rely on the network need a higher-level regulatory body to exercise regulatory powers. A national information supervision committee should be established to use this regulatory platform for simple supervision, achieving the separation of government and business. Mutual access to achieve market-oriented operation is a prerequisite. In the practice of the convergence of the three networks, most countries directly allow mutual access. The UK legislation explicitly stipulates that traditional broadcasting and telecommunications can enter each other, and adopts a competitive regulatory approach for the telecommunications industry, while the access to the broadcasting industry is relatively stricter. There are no legal barriers for telecommunications companies in Germany and India to provide integrated services. The development of the convergence of the three networks should fully play the role of market mechanisms, which are the prerequisite for promoting the convergence of the three networks. In terms of domestic reality, the integration of the three networks has indeed changed the external relationship between the broadcasting and television and telecommunications, but the intrinsic characteristics of both sides remain independent. But the trend of the convergence of the three networks is irreversible, and the demand for the convergence of the three networks is more urgent in the context of the current financial crisis. Although the Radio and Television Administration has been promoting reforms, it has also been reported that the Radio and Television Administration is both an athlete and a referee, which is not in line with the laws of the market economy. The suspension of IPTV by Huangshi Radio and Television Administration and the forced promotion of digital television by Putian Radio and Television Administration can be seen from this. The radio and television authorities should accelerate the pace of market-oriented reform. It is feasible to achieve ""separation of production and broadcasting"" in radio and television, that is, separating content from transmission. With this, the integration of the three networks will be a natural outcome. Tripartite network integration transcends all interests. Currently, the recovery of the global economy mainly benefits from the short-term effects of various countries' economic stimulus programs. A series of domestic policies of the country are related to stimulating domestic demand and creating new growth points. Issuing 3G licenses and accelerating the integration of the three networks are all moves in this direction, which are decisions above the group's interests. Standing from this perspective, it is not difficult to understand the tight integration timetable set by the country. The integration of the three networks is extremely difficult for the broadcasting and television network, which is currently a four-level (provincial, municipal, county, and district) independent administration system across the country. The unification of the network must first reform the system, separate from the administrative and public institutions, and establish a corporate management model. That is, to separate from the Radio and Television Administration and establish an independent network group to form the ""fourth network operator"" to participate in the competition of the network industry. For the telecommunications industry, the current content bottleneck is still a key constraint on further development of the telecommunications industry, especially without the power of ""play"" and ""broadcast"". And in terms of content creation, the telecom industry is also a novice. For the telecommunications industry, the most appropriate phrase is to strengthen the transformation of the entire IP network, improve the operational capabilities of all businesses, and integrate the business provision capabilities of personal, family, enterprise, and vertical fields. But these are not enough to stop the inevitable trend of China's three networks integration. It now seems that the formation of a market mechanism is not a one-day job, and unified regulation at the level of national will needs to be implemented first."
谷歌就无人驾驶汽车项目在内华达州展开游说新浪科技讯北京时间5月12日上午消息，谷歌正在悄悄展开游说活动，推动内华达成为全美首个允许无人驾驶汽车上路的州。立法游说通过这些立法提案，谷歌希望内华达州能够允许驾驶者通过发送短信的方式控制汽车，而不必因此遭到处罚。此前不到一年，谷歌刚刚承认，正在开发一种能够在没有人工干预的情况下安全行驶的汽车。谷歌去年回应记者采访时表示，已经在加州的公路上对无人驾驶的混合动力汽车进行了测试，测试总里程达到14万英里(约合22.5万公里)。其中有超过1000英里的路程全部由机器人自动驾驶。还有一名谷歌工程师在上下班的50英里路程上测试过部分汽车的无人驾驶功能。谷歌当时并未透露该项目的商用计划。但该公司周二证实，正在对内华达州进行立法游说。不过，谷歌高管拒绝透露为何选择内华达州作为目的地。谷歌发言人杰伊·南卡罗(JayNancarrow)表示，该项目仍然处于测试阶段。谷歌还聘请了游说专家大卫·古德沃特(DavidGoldwater)帮助其推动两项议案，并有望在6月末的内华达州议会立法会议上投票表决。其中一项是允许进行无人驾驶汽车的测试，另外一项则是允许驾驶员发送短信控制电动车。古德沃特4月7日表示，无人驾驶技术比人工驾驶更为安全，而且油耗更低，甚至能够促进经济发展。尽管汽车行业正在加快普及人工智能技术，但完全依靠自动化系统驾驶汽车仍然引发了对安全性和事故责任的质疑。政策制定者和监管者警告称，当前的技术发展非常迅速，有可能会超出现有的法律规定范围。他们认为，如果无人驾驶汽车成为现实，就必须要尽快进行立法。投入商用政策分析师认为，内华达州是首个考虑推广商用无人驾驶汽车的州。这种汽车可以自动泊车、自动驾驶，甚至可以充当自动出租车，为拉斯维加斯的赌场服务。“从某种意义上讲，这是一个很好的范本和模式。它承认需要为测试这种汽车创造一个流程，并在内华达开辟一个区域以供测试。”斯坦福法学院教授瑞恩·卡罗(RyanCalo)说。谷歌的6辆无人驾驶汽车都采用丰田普锐斯和奥迪TT两种车型，由于车顶配备雷达探测器，因此很容易识别。这类汽车还配有多种雷达和摄像头传感器，以及大量的电脑设备。在测试项目中，每辆车都由一名驾驶员负责，另外还有一名谷歌员工负责在客座上监测设备。由于有驾驶员参与，使得谷歌成功规避了法律风险。该项目由人工智能专家塞巴斯蒂安·特伦(SebastianThrun)负责，他在2005年担任斯坦福大学教授时，就曾经领导一组学生和工程师在美国国防部高级研究计划署(DARPA)举行的无人驾驶汽车大赛中获胜。自那以后，特伦便将更多精力放在谷歌的项目上，甚至放弃了在斯坦福大学的终身教授身份，并且聘请了众多专家帮助他完成这个项目。特伦曾多次在公共场合表示，无人驾驶汽车将提升能源效率，同时减少交通事故。他还曾呼吁建立复杂的拼车系统，从而将美国的汽车保有量减少一半。谷歌雄心勃勃的无人驾驶汽车计划表明，硅谷地区正在兴起一个全新的汽车产业。梅赛德斯、大众和其他汽车厂商都已经在该地区建立了实验室。IBM也推出了电池研发项目。在美国电动车制造商Tesla的推动下，原先由通用汽车和丰田合资成立的Nummi汽车工厂也重新开张。(书聿)	杰伊·南卡罗,大卫·古德沃特,古德沃特,瑞恩·卡罗,塞巴斯蒂安·特伦,特伦,书聿	正向	Google is lobbying in Nevada for its self-driving car project. Sina Tech News, Beijing time, May 12, 2018: Google is quietly lobbying to make Nevada the first state in the US to allow self-driving cars on the road. Legislative lobbying through these legislative proposals, Google hopes that Nevada will allow drivers to control the car by sending text messages without being punished. Less than a year earlier, Google had admitted that it was developing a car that could drive safely without any human intervention. Google responded to a journalist's interview last year that it had tested a hybrid self-driving car on the roads in California, with a total mileage of 140,000 miles (about 225,000 kilometers). More than 1000 miles of the journey were driven entirely by the robot. Another Google engineer tested the autonomous driving feature on a 50-mile commute to and from work. Google did not disclose its plans for commercializing the project at the time. But the company confirmed on Tuesday that it was lobbying the state of Nevada for legislation. However, Google executives refused to reveal why they chose Nevada as the destination. Jay Nancarrow, a Google spokesperson, said that the project is still in the testing phase. Google also hired lobbyist David Goldwater to help push two bills, which are expected to be voted on at the Nevada Legislature’s legislative session in mid-June. One of them is to allow the testing of autonomous vehicles, and the other is to allow drivers to send text messages to control electric vehicles. Goodwater said on April 7 that autonomous driving is safer than manual driving, and consumes less fuel, and can even promote economic development. Although the automotive industry is accelerating the popularization of artificial intelligence technology, fully relying on automated systems to drive cars still raises questions about safety and accident liability. Regulators and policymakers warn that current technological developments are advancing very rapidly and may exceed the scope of existing legal regulations. They think that if driverless cars become a reality, legislation will have to be enacted as soon as possible. Commercial policy analysts believe that Nevada is the first state to consider promoting commercial autonomous vehicles. This car can park itself, drive itself, and even serve as an autonomous taxi for the casinos in Las Vegas. In a sense, it is a good model and example. It acknowledges the need to create a process for testing such a car and to carve out an area in Nevada for testing. Professor Ryan Calo of Stanford Law School said. Google’s six driverless cars are both Toyota Prius and Audi TT models, which are easy to identify because of the radar detectors on the roof. These cars are also equipped with a variety of radar and camera sensors, as well as a large number of computer devices. In the test project, each car is responsible for one driver, and there is also a Google employee responsible for monitoring the equipment on the passenger seat. Because of the driver's participation, Google was able to sidestep the legal risks. The project is overseen by Sebastian Thrun, an artificial intelligence expert, who led a team of students and engineers to victory in the DARPA Grand Challenge, an autonomous vehicle competition held in the United States, when he was a professor at Stanford University in 2005. Since then, Tren has devoted more of his energy to Google’s projects, even giving up his tenured professorship at Stanford University and hiring many experts to help him complete this project. Tren has repeatedly stated in public that driverless cars will improve energy efficiency and reduce traffic accidents. He has also called for the establishment of complex carpooling systems to cut the number of cars on American roads in half. Google's ambitious autonomous car program shows that a new automotive industry is emerging in the Silicon Valley region. Mercedes, Volkswagen and other car manufacturers have already established laboratories in the region. IBM also launched a battery research and development project. With the push from the American electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, the Nummi car factory, which was originally jointly established by General Motors and Toyota, has also reopened. (Shu Yu)
中国境内银行换汇最划算轻易别找导游换外币春节将至，很多市民踊跃报名团体境外游。如何兑换外币、兑换多少外币，成为多数境外游“菜鸟”的疑问。记者了解到，此中猫腻多多，游客要想省钱，最好提前在中国内地兑换好，交易费用至少可省一成。文/记者井楠记者了解到，报团出国游，兑换外汇一般有三种途径，一是在中国境内找银行兑换，二是在飞机场银行兑换，三是出国以后找当地导游兑换。站在游客的角度来说，三个方法中，在中国境内兑换最划算，飞机场兑换则最不划算。比如广州市民青睐的泰国游。人民币与泰铢目前的汇率中间价是4.84，那么，在中国内地的银行办理，包括千分之三到千分之六的交易费用，市民的买入价格一般在4.81到4.83之间，100元人民币，可以换到至少481元的泰铢。而各国的飞机场银行运作成本高昂，外汇买入与卖出价格一般相差15%到30%，也就是说，如果市民到飞机场兑换100元人民币，一般只能换到410~420元人民币。至于当地导游，不赚外国人的钱是绝对不可能的。一般来说，100元人民币也只能换到大约450元的泰铢。据记者了解，各地的华人导游虽然有区别，但赚10%的外汇差价，是全球业内不成文的潜规则；该差价也要与中国内地的领队分享。最好提前1天预约银行网点除非时间确实紧急，建议游客最好先在内地的银行兑换好外汇。从广州目前的情况来看，去中国银行兑换外币仍是最为便捷、费用较合理的途径，交易费用按日调整，一般为千分之三到千分之五。工商银行、招商银行、外资银行也开办类似业务，有的费用略高，有的营业网点有限，需要等待较长时间。每家银行网点预留的外汇有限，顾客最好提前1天预约，打银行服务热线的人工服务，就近挑选营业网点，留下联系电话后，等待银行的通知。一旦接到通知，就携带人民币与身份证，去柜台办理。当然，多数的银行网点都有比较充足的港币、美元与欧元，有的时候不用预约，也可当场办理。参照报团费1比1准备额外外汇出国旅游该准备多少额外的外汇？民生银行理财专家简岑认为，对于多数中国内地游客来说，参照报团费用，1比1准备出国的额外花费比较合适。比如在广州报名日本的本州6日游，每人报团的费用一般在7899元人民币。每个人交完团费之后，最好还要准备折合约8000元人民币的日元。这是因为，除开报团费，出国的花费一般分为三部分。首先是自费项目。一般旅行团指定自费项目的最大预算相当于旅游团费的1/3到1/2比例，游客交了8000元去旅游，如果想所有项目都玩，就需至少再准备2400元。再者，矿泉水、小食品等即时消费也是出国花费的主要组成部分，一般按照每人每天100元的标准。去欧洲玩10天，就至少需要再追加1000元，去日本玩6天，就还需要600元。最后，游客出国都要购物，去的国家不同，区别较大，但一般准备相当于团费1/3到1/2的费用，总是能应付过来的。三个项目加总起来，总花费基本相当于团费总额，构成了1比1的比例。	井楠,简岑	正向	It is not easy to exchange foreign currency for the most cost-effective bank in China before the Spring Festival, and many citizens are enthusiastic about signing up for group overseas tours. How to exchange foreign currency and how much foreign currency to exchange are the questions of most newbies in overseas travel. Journalists have learned that there are many tricks, and tourists should exchange in advance in mainland China to save at least 10% of the transaction fees. By Jin Nan, a reporter, it is understood that when traveling abroad for tourism, there are generally three ways to exchange foreign currency, one is to exchange in the bank in China, the second is to exchange in the bank at the airport, and the third is to exchange with local tour guides after going abroad. From the perspective of tourists, among the three methods, it is the most cost-effective to exchange currency within China, and the least cost-effective to exchange at the airport. For example, the trip to Thailand favored by the residents of Guangzhou. The current exchange rate between the RMB and the Thai baht is 4.84. If you handle the transaction in the bank in the Chinese mainland, including a transaction fee of 0.3% to 0.6%, the price at which citizens buy is generally between 4.81 and 4.83. 100 RMB can be exchanged for at least 481 Thai baht. And the airport banks in various countries have high operating costs, and the exchange rate between foreign exchange buying and selling is generally 15% to 30% apart, which means that if citizens exchange 100 yuan at the airport, they can only get 410-420 yuan. As for the local guides, it is absolutely impossible for them not to earn money from foreigners. Generally, 100 RMB can only be exchanged for about 450 Thai Baht. According to the reporters, although the Chinese tour guides in various places have differences, earning 10% of the foreign exchange difference is an unwritten rule in the industry worldwide; the difference should also be shared with the team leaders in China. It is best to make an appointment with the bank branch one day in advance. Unless the time is really urgent, it is recommended that tourists exchange foreign currency in advance at the bank on the mainland. Currently, in Guangzhou, exchanging foreign currency at the China Bank is still the most convenient and cost-effective way, with transaction fees adjusted daily, generally ranging from 0.3% to 0.5%. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, and foreign banks also offer similar services, but some have slightly higher fees and some have limited business outlets, requiring a longer waiting time. Each branch of the bank has a limited amount of foreign exchange. Customers are advised to make an appointment one day in advance by calling the bank's service hotline for人工服务, choose the nearest business branch, leave your contact number, and wait for the bank's notification. Once you receive the notice, please bring RMB and your ID to the counter to handle the matter. Of course, most bank branches have sufficient Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, and euros, and sometimes you can handle the business on the spot without an appointment. How much extra foreign currency should be prepared for overseas travel in addition to the tour fee at a ratio of 1 to 1? Chen Zhen, a wealth management expert of Minsheng Bank, believes that for most Chinese tourists on the mainland, preparing an additional cost of 1 to 1 for overseas travel according to the cost of joining a tour group is appropriate. For example, the cost of a 6-day tour of Honshu in Japan, which is signed up for in Guangzhou, is generally 7,899 yuan per person. After everyone has paid the group fee, it is best to prepare about 8000 RMB in Japanese yen. This is because, apart from the travel agency fee, the cost of going abroad is generally divided into three parts. First are the self-funded projects. The maximum budget for self-funded items specified by general travel groups is 1/3 to 1/2 of the travel fee. If a tourist pays 8000 yuan for a trip, he needs to prepare at least 2400 yuan more if he wants to play all the items. In addition, mineral water, snacks, and other instant consumption are also major components of overseas spending, generally at a standard of 100 yuan per person per day. For a 10-day trip to Europe, you need to add at least 1000 yuan, and for a 6-day trip to Japan, you still need 600 yuan. Finally, tourists have to shop when they go abroad, and the differences are quite large depending on the country they visit, but in general, preparing one-third to half of the tour fee is always enough. The total cost of the three projects is roughly equivalent to the total cost of the group fee, forming a 1:1 ratio.
英国东南部肯特郡4万只死蟹被冲上海岸(组图)环球时报特约记者宋华报道据英国《每日邮报》1月5日报道，世界多地最近多次发生大量动物神秘死亡事件，首先是数千只燕八哥在美国阿肯色州坠亡，接下来又有数千条死鱼被冲上海岸。现在，又发现4万多只死梭子蟹(又称魔鬼蟹)被冲上英国东南部肯特郡海岸。报道称，数万死蟹沿英国肯特郡的海岸线被冲上岸，环境专家认为，英国寒冷的天气可能是导致梭子蟹死亡的原因。梭子蟹据信是英国120年来最寒冷的12月份的受害者，寒冷的天气使海水温度比平常值低了不少。英国塞恩特海岸看守托尼•斯亚克斯称：“我们怀疑气候变化和更温暖的天气诱使蟹前往海岸线，它们进入这些海域可能是为了寻找海藻。我们认为，温度突然下降使蟹因温度过低而死亡。”与此同时，5日在瑞典斯德哥尔摩的一条街道上发现了50只寒鸦的尸体。调查这一事件的兽医对美联社称，目前还不清楚这些鸟的死亡原因，但4日晚上事发地曾燃放过焰火。除了焰火之外，兽医称，寒冷的天气和难以找到食物也可能是导致鸟死亡的原因。在此之前，美国发生了数起大量动物死亡的事件。450只鸟4日在路易斯安那州坠亡，原因不详。在新年前夕，3000多只红翼燕八哥从阿肯色州的空中坠亡。美国官员承认他们可能无法确认鸟死亡的原因。另外，在距事发地以西数百英里的野生专家仍在努力寻找10万条死鱼被冲上河岸的原因。	宋华,斯亚克斯	正向	"40,000 crabs washed up dead on the Kent coast in the southeast of England (photo report) Global Times special reporter Song Hua reports. According to the UK Daily Mail on January 5, there have been multiple mysterious animal deaths in many parts of the world in recent times. First, thousands of magpies fell dead in Arkansas, USA, and then thousands of dead fish were washed up on the shore. Now, another 40,000 dead king crabs (also known as devil crabs) have been washed up on the Kent coast in southeastern England. Reports said that tens of thousands of dead crabs were washed up on the shore of Kent, UK, and environmental experts believe that the cold weather in the UK may be the cause of the梭子蟹's death. The梭子蟹 is believed to be the victim of the coldest December in the UK in 120 years, with the cold weather causing the sea water temperature to be much lower than usual. Tony Smith, a warden on the English coast, said, ""We suspect that climate change and warmer weather have lured the crabs to the coast, and they may have entered these waters in search of algae."" We believe that the sudden drop in temperature caused the crabs to die from cold. At the same time, 50 crows' bodies were found on a street in Stockholm, Sweden on May 5. The veterinarian investigating the incident told the Associated Press that it was not yet clear what caused the birds’ deaths, but that fireworks had been set off at the site on the evening of April 4. Besides fireworks, the cold weather and the difficulty in finding food may also be the cause of the death of the birds, according to the veterinarian. Before this, there were several incidents of mass animal deaths in the United States. 450 birds fell dead in Louisiana on April 4th, the cause is unknown. On New Year's Eve, more than 3,000 red-winged blackbirds fell from the sky in Arkansas. US officials admit that they may not be able to determine the cause of the bird's death. Moreover, wildlife experts hundreds of miles west of the incident site are still struggling to find out why 100,000 dead fish were washed up on the riverbank."

What do you think of Yi Jianlian's performance in the whole game, scoring 2 points, 11 rebounds, 2 blocks, hitting his 500th career NBA shot, grabbing his 800th rebound, and 300 free throws? >>> The Nets (3-39) have lost ten in a row, which is already their third time losing ten or more games in a row this season. In their last 21 games, the Nets have won only one. Brook Lopez scored 21 points and grabbed 6 rebounds, while Courtney Lee scored 17 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. Yi Jianlian scored only 2 points from 6 shots, but grabbed 11 rebounds and had 2 steals and 2 blocks. In addition, after this game, Yi Jianlian's personal NBA career points reached 500, rebounds reached 800, and free throws made reached 300, becoming the second Chinese player to reach this series of milestones after Yao Ming. The Warriors (13-28) closed it easily. Stephen Curry played for 48 minutes, scoring 32 points and making 7 assists, Cory Maggette scored 29 points, and Anthony Toliver scored 12 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Monta Ellis played for 24 minutes and scored 4 points with 5 assists. In the last three games, the Warriors could only field 8 players, 3 of whom came from NBDL. Monta Ellis played all three games without a single minute of rest. Before, only Allen Iverson played all 3 games in 1997, and no one has played all 4 games for 23 years. Ellis had a chance to break the record, but he failed to do so due to a sprained right ankle. In the first quarter, the two teams were still in contention. In the last 3 minutes and 34 seconds of the quarter, the Nets only scored one basket, and the Warriors led 26-21 at the end of the quarter. Yi Jianlian attempted a shot and missed, and failed to score. Ellis was also off, missing all four shots in the quarter and failing to score. Yi Jianlian still failed to score in one more shot in the second period. The Warriors had a 19-point lead, 42-23, with 7:14 left in the quarter. After that, Lopez scored one point and Kutney Li hit three consecutive three-pointers. The Nets scored 13-4 and narrowed the score to 36-44. In the last 6 minutes, the Warriors only scored one basket, but they still maintained their advantage, leading 50-44 at halftime. With 10:17 left in the third quarter, Yi Jianlian finally scored a basket from within one step of the three-point line, which was his first score of the game. But the Warriors scored 4 straight to extend their lead to double digits. Then the Warriors continued to attack fiercely and ended the period with a 10-0 run, taking a 23-point lead, 88-65. In the last 3 minutes and 39 seconds of this quarter, the Nets did not score a single point. Beginning with 8:41 left in the fourth quarter, the Warriors failed to make a field goal in 3:35, yet the Nets failed to cut the deficit to within 20 points. With 5:06 left in the game, McGee hit a three-pointer, and the Warriors launched a 9-0 run to take a 104-73 lead with a 31-point advantage. The outcome was never in doubt, and the Warriors were forced to keep Curry and others on the court due to a lack of sufficient substitutes. [Live broadcast transcript][Technical statistics](Angkor)

周三亚马逊将推出平板电脑KindleFire传说中的亚马逊平板电脑终于要来了，TechCrunch的MGSiegler确认了这个消息。在美国时间周三，亚马逊将推出平板电脑：KindleFire，这个名字是为了和它的电子阅读设备Kindle区分开，届时亚马逊CEO杰夫贝索斯将登台演讲，但是这个设备真正开卖还要等到11月的第二个星期。KindleFire将有7英寸的背光显示器，很像黑莓的PlayBook。但经过MG试用，他认为亚马逊的设备要比PlayBook更好，因为他们有更好的软件以及更好的内容。亚马逊有自己定制的Android操作系统(和Android一点也不像)和自己的应用商店，但是它的商店不会提供所有官方Android市场里的应用。亚马逊已经邀请那些大的应用开发商去参加他们的发布会。亚马逊还与福布斯合作电影和电视等流媒体内容，这也将成为KindleFire非常核心的一部分，同时他们与一些内容发布商合作由他们来提供杂志内容。毫无疑问亚马逊的MP3服务和电子书服务会重度集成到设备中。只是目前还不确定KindleFire采用的是什么芯片，据猜测可能是双核的OMAP芯片，主频1.2GHz。下面是根据描述MG的同学画出来的图片，也就是说，KindleFire的样子跟这张图片差得不远：	周三亚马逊,MGSiegler,杰夫贝索斯	正向	On Wednesday, Amazon will launch the tablet Kindle Fire. TechCrunch's MGSiegler confirmed the news. The long-awaited Amazon tablet is finally here. On Wednesday, Amazon will launch a tablet: Kindle Fire, which is named to distinguish it from its e-reader device, Kindle. At that time, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will give a speech, but the device will not be available for sale until the second week of November. Kindle Fire will have a 7-inch backlit display, much like BlackBerry's PlayBook. But after the MG trial, he thought that Amazon’s devices were better than PlayBook, because they had better software and better content. Amazon has its own customized Android operating system (and is nothing like Android) and its own app store, but its store does not provide all the applications in the official Android market. Amazon has invited the big application developers to attend their launch event. Amazon also collaborates with Forbes on streaming content for movies and TV, which will become a very core part of the Kindle Fire, and they also collaborate with some content publishers to provide magazine content. There is no doubt that Amazon's MP3 service and e-book service will be heavily integrated into the devices. It is not yet clear what chip Kindle Fire is using, but it is speculated that it may be a dual-core OMAP chip with a frequency of 1.2GHz. Below is the picture drawn by the MG student according to the description, that is, the appearance of Kindle Fire is not far from this picture:

揍记者主帅一夜成民族英雄3年30球大将吓破蓝军胆记者王庆报报道得知新西兰和巴拉圭战平，斯洛伐克人疯狂庆祝，首次以独立国家身份参加世界杯就进了淘汰赛，他们是真正的意外。主帅魏斯说得没错：“我个人十分崇拜里皮。可他们被迫赢球，我们不是，谁脑子里更放松，谁能拿下这场比赛。”从过程看，斯洛伐克更放松。意大利北方联盟代表、国家联邦改革委员翁贝托·博西赛前说意大利会收买斯洛伐克达到出线目的、下赛季斯洛伐克人大批出现在意甲赛场，魏斯一脸惊讶：“什么意思？是玩笑吗？这个人我不知道，更不清楚他想干什么。我只认识意大利总理，还是从电视上看的。”魏斯这位前捷克斯洛伐克国脚成了民族英雄，没人会记得他的粗暴，第二场输巴拉圭赛后，他和本国记者怒目相向还动了手，他批评记者：“真得感谢你们，你们比国外记者都好。写了那么多坏话，现在还有脸来采访我儿子？真是狗屎，我要朝你的脸给上一拳”，然后和一名叫斯帕切克的记者扭做一团。所有情况被国际足联两位官员记录在案，很可能对魏斯给予处罚。魏斯口气强硬：“我遗憾，但决不认错，那些人传递了悲观消极的信号让我们不舒服，足球本身应该是快乐的。”拿到世界杯16强名额，魏斯就算打人，也不会有人在意了。维泰克一战成名，对卫冕冠军梅开二度，加上对新西兰的入球，3球成为头号射手，抢了头号球星哈姆西克风头。意大利太注意哈姆西克了，他在意大利的3个赛季107场联赛进了30球，刚结束的意甲赛季他破门12次，和埃托奥、帕托相等，是进球最多的中场球员。更可怕在，他对意大利许多国脚都有噩梦记录，哈姆西克自认最漂亮进球在2008年5月倒数第二轮对米兰，米兰于客场失掉冠军杯席位的关键战，哈姆西克中场从加图索脚下断球长驱直入劲射破门。哈姆西克最喜欢的靶子是尤文，4个进球，其中3个在刚结束的赛季都决定了比赛结果，3球都在卡纳瓦罗、基耶利尼中卫组合面前完成。马尔凯蒂也无法幸免，2008年11月哈姆西克进了马尔凯蒂一球，不过去年12月那不勒斯和卡利亚里3比3大战，马尔凯蒂异常神勇化解哈姆西克所有射门。真所谓不是冤家不聚头。赢球后哈姆西克非常激动，“我的位置无所谓，每个教练都有自己想法。对巴拉圭我更靠前一些，这次靠后一些，这不是靠左10米还是靠右10米的问题，在于全队态度。意大利就像一座高山挡在所有人面前，如今我们翻越了高山。”那不勒斯球员参加世界杯的不少，意大利有4个，乌拉圭还有个加尔加诺，不过打上主力的只有哈姆西克一个。	王庆,魏斯,里皮,翁贝托·博西,斯帕切克,维泰克,梅开二度,哈姆西克,埃托奥,帕托,加图索,尤文,卡纳瓦罗,基耶利尼,马尔凯蒂,加尔加诺	正向	"The coach of the team, who beat the reporter, became a national hero in one night, scoring 30 goals in 3 years, and a major player who frightened the Blues. Wang Qing reported that New Zealand and Paraguay drew, and the Slovaks celebrated wildly. For the first time as an independent country, they entered the knockout stage of the World Cup, and they were truly a surprise. Assistant: The head coach Weiss was right: ""I personally admire Li Tie very much."" But they have to win, we don't. Who has the loose mind, who can take this game. From the process, Slovakia is more relaxed. Umberto Bossi, the Northern League representative and chairman of the National Federation Reform Commission, said before the match that Italy would buy Slovakia to qualify, and a large number of Slovaks will appear in the Italian Serie A next season, Wei Si was surprised: ""What do you mean?"" Is it a joke? I don't know this person, and I have no idea what he wants to do. I only know the Italian Prime Minister from TV. Ves, the former Czechoslovak international, became a national hero, and no one would remember his brutality. After the second loss to Paraguay, he glared at the local reporters and even fought with them, criticizing the reporters: ""Thank you very much, you are better than foreign reporters."" Having written so much bad stuff, do you have the face to interview my son now? What a shit, I want to punch you in the face"", and then wrestled with a journalist named Spachek. All cases were recorded by two FIFA officials, and Wei is likely to be punished. Viesse was firm: ""I regret it, but I will not admit it. Those people sent us negative signals that made us uncomfortable. Football itself should be joyful."" With the World Cup 16th place slot in hand, Wei Si would not be bothered even if he hit someone. Vittek scored twice against the defending champion and once against New Zealand, scoring three goals to become the top scorer and stealing the spotlight from the top star Hamšík. Italy paid too much attention to Hamsik, who scored 30 goals in 107 league games in 3 seasons in Italy, and scored 12 goals in the just-ended Serie A season, equal to Eto'o and Park, the top scorer in midfield. What is even more terrifying is that he has a nightmare record against many Italian national team players. Hamsik admitted that his most beautiful goal was in the second to last round of the 2008 match against Milan. Milan lost the key match to lose the Champions League seat, and Hamsik intercepted the ball from Gattuso in the middle of the field and ran straight to score a powerful shot. Hamshic's favorite target is Juventus, with 4 goals, 3 of which decided the game in the just concluded season, and 3 goals were scored in front of the Cannavaro and Chiellini center-back combination. Malacarne was not spared either, when Hamšík scored against him in November 2008, but last December, when Napoli drew 3-3 with Cagliari, Malacarne was in top form and saved all of Hamšík’s shots. True to the saying that enemies do not meet unless they are fated to. Hamšík was very excited after the victory, ""My position doesn't matter, each coach has his own ideas."" I am more in Paraguay this time, and a bit further back this time. It's not a question of being 10 meters to the left or right, but the attitude of the whole team. Italy was like a mountain in front of everyone, and now we have climbed the mountain. There are quite a few Napoli players in the World Cup, with four in Italy and one in Uruguay, Gargano, but only Hamshik is a starter."

单打王：熟悉西海岸球风所以打得好助理教练很棒新浪体育讯　北京时间3月3日(华盛顿时间2日)奇才对阵勇士的第四节，无疑是属于尼克-杨的，这个神经刀一样的妖人，只要投出手感，无论对面站着谁，一样无解。单节狂得14分，并在最后6.9秒投中关键球，将比赛的胜负拉到最后一秒钟。尽管球队最后输球，但是尼克-杨全场却贡献了31分。赛后的尼克-杨摇摇头，即使说到自己的31分，也丝毫看不出喜悦，“我们输球了，31分也没有太大意义了。”杨在最后一节的疯狂表现，让曾经一度领先奇才20分的勇士一下子感受到了危机感。而对杨进行了夹击，但是任凭面前再多支手，杨也照样能够投进，从第四节11分49秒开始，表演就一直持续到最后的6秒，最后6.9秒，奇才以99比103落后4分，所有的球迷都以为胜利无望，纷纷退场时，杨在三分线外出手，此时，两名队员的手都捂在了杨的脸上，可是皮球仍然应声入网。全场沸腾。而杨也高兴的露出了他孩子般的招牌笑容。可惜，之后，皮球再没有轮转到杨的手里，奇才一直制造犯规战术，而勇士队4罚3中，奇才遗憾告负。赛后，记者都想让杨谈谈第四节的疯狂表现，但是往常嘻嘻哈哈的杨却乐不起来。“进了那个球的时候，我感觉很好，觉得我们还有机会，但是可惜，我们没有抢到一个关键的篮板，输掉了比赛。这真的很可惜。”杨摇摇头。有记者问，为什么今天后半场杨才找到些手感。杨说：“之前我们全队都打的不好，进攻中有些乱，我想要投进去，可是皮球偏偏弹出。而下半场，我感觉自己的手慢慢热了起来，我感觉我们虽然输了很多，但是比赛没有结束，我应该赶紧做点什么。”金州勇士队来自加州，而尼克-杨也是加州人，对阵勇士，妖星感觉到更多的是熟悉和亲切。“他们打的就是西海岸的篮球，我对西海岸的篮球打法很清楚，很熟悉，所以我打这种比赛通常会发挥的不错。而且你知道，我的家人都在那边，我一想到他们在看我的比赛呢，我就觉得很兴奋，我告诉自己，不能放松。只可惜今天球队输掉了比赛。”说起助理教练的指导，尼克-杨甚是肯定，他说：“兰迪一直告诉我们要保持自信，一直鼓励我们，不要以为对方领先那么多我们就一定会输，那只是暂时的，尽管我们没有赢球，但是他是个好教练，告诉我们的信念非常重要。”(华盛顿特派记者沈洋前方报道)	尼克-杨,杨,杨摇,杨才,兰迪,沈洋	正向	"Single champion: Nick Young, who is familiar with the style of play of the west coast, plays well. The assistant coach is great. Sina Sports News, March 3, Beijing time (Washington time on the 2nd), in the fourth quarter of the game between the Wizards and the Warriors, it was undoubtedly the time belonging to Nick Young, this kind of crazy player, as long as he has a sense of shooting, no matter who stands in front of him, he is still unsolvable. Score 14 points in a single period and make a key shot in the last 6.9 seconds, bringing the game to the last second. Nick Young scored 31 points for the team, although they lost the game. Nick Young shook his head after the game, and even when he talked about his 31 points, he didn't look happy at all. ""We lost the game, 31 points don't matter much."" Yang's crazy performance in the last period made the Warriors feel the crisis after leading the Wizards by 20 points. While clamping down on Yang, but no matter how many hands were in front of him, Yang could still make it. From 11:49 of the fourth quarter, the performance continued until the last 6 seconds. With 6.9 seconds left, the Wizards were trailing by 4 points, 99-103. All the fans thought that victory was hopeless and left the stadium. At this time, Yang made a three-point shot, and two players' hands were covering Yang's face. However, the ball still went into the net. The whole stadium was沸腾boiling. And Yang also revealed his trademark smile like a child. Unfortunately, after that, the ball never made its way back to Yang’s hands. The Wizards kept using the foul strategy, and the Warriors made 3 out of 4 free throws. The Wizards lost the game in disappointment. After the game, the reporters all wanted Yang to talk about his crazy performance in the fourth quarter, but usually Yang, who was always happy, was not happy. When I scored that goal, I felt good and thought we still had a chance, but unfortunately, we didn't get a key rebound and lost the game. This is really a pity. Yang shook his head. A reporter asked why Yang found his rhythm in the second half of the game today. Yang said, ""Before, our whole team played poorly, and the attack was somewhat chaotic. I wanted to shoot, but the ball happened to bounce out."" In the second half, I felt my hand gradually warming up, and I felt that although we lost a lot, the game was not over, and I should do something as soon as possible. The Golden State Warriors are from California, and Nick Young is also a native of California. Facing the Warriors, the star felt more familiar and warm. They play the basketball of the West Coast, I know very well and am very familiar with the basketball style of the West Coast, so I usually perform well in this kind of game. And you know, my family is over there, and I get so excited thinking about them watching my game, so I tell myself I can’t relax. Unfortunately, the team lost the game today. When it comes to the assistant coach's guidance, Nick Young is very positive. He said, ""Randy has always told us to stay confident, always encouraged us, and not to think that because the other team is leading by a lot, we will definitely lose. That's just temporary. Although we didn't win the game, he is a good coach, and the belief he told us is very important."" ""(Washington correspondent Shen Yang reports from the front)"""
热议：考研成功的第一秘诀是什么信心，是成功的第一秘诀。——[美]爱默生美国作家爱默生说话很精辟，但非常具有哲理。细细品来，给我们无穷的思考和鼓励。对于考研的学生来说，基础差、底子薄的现象广泛存在，有的考生还在职，放下课本多年，要复习考研都不是一件简单的事情。难道就要放弃？不，这样的考生很显然没有自信！细数国内研究生，不是每一个都天生聪明，他们能考上，为什么自己考不上呢？用爱默生的话来说，叫：自信，是考研成功的第一秘诀。信心，self-confidence,只有相信自己能够成功的人，才会有无穷的动力，才会让我们去为成功作准备，而不是去为失败找借口。对于在校学生来说，可以利用的考研复习时间那么多，为什么还要唉声叹气、举步不前？在考研教育网，去年有这样一个学员，任职于天津一家公司，与公司签定了三年工作合同，辞职需支付巨额违约金，所以直到8月底合同到期后才真正走出工厂、辞职考研。给网校打电话之前并不知道远程辅导可以随时随地听，所以8月底才开始准备。第一次考研，他英语基本上算是零基础，政治、数学自大二学完，放下五年了，而且当时也仅是六十几分勉强通过的。打过报名电话之后，报了实验班，希望在班主任的帮助下，在剩下的时间中能顺利考上。班主任问他现在开始复习有没有什么心理的负担，他很坦然地说：“既然都晚了就得想方法赶上，别的想多了也是白想。我辞职了，有时间了，加上知道工作的难处，肯定会比他们肯学，所以我相信我不会落后，会迎头赶上。”这个学员就凭着自己的自信和韧劲，在班主任老师指导的方法下拿下了东北大学自动化的研究生，东北大学自动化，那是全国知名，人家考上了，这种自信和韧劲值得很多人学习。很多人是自己放弃了自己，认为自己考不上，但是却在扼杀自己自信心的同时，粉碎了自己的研究生梦想，悲哉！《老残游记》里说：天地生才有限，不宜妄自菲薄！意思是天生的天才是极少的，大家都差不多，绝不应该自己瞧不起自己！所以当自己怀疑自己能力的时候，大家不妨对自己说一下这句话，给自己增加信心，打消自卑心理，勇敢在考研路上前行吧！更多信息请访问：新浪考研频道考研论坛考研博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。	爱默生	正向	"Hot topic: What is the first secret to success in the postgraduate entrance examination? Confidence is the first secret to success. —- [US] Emerson American writer Emerson speaks very incisively, but is very philosophical. To savor, to give us endless thinking and encouragement. For students preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination, the phenomenon of weak foundation and thin base is widespread, and some candidates are still on the job, putting down the textbooks for many years, and reviewing for the postgraduate entrance examination is not an easy thing. Are we going to give up? No, such candidates are obviously not confident! Count the domestic postgraduates, not every one of them is naturally smart. Why can they be admitted, but not themselves? In Emerson's words, it is confidence that is the first secret of success in the postgraduate entrance examination. Confidence, self-confidence, only those who believe they can succeed will have infinite power, and will let us prepare for success rather than find excuses for failure. For students in school, there are so many times that can be used for postgraduate entrance examination review, why sigh and move forward hesitantly? Last year, there was a student on the R&D Education Network who worked for a company in Tianjin and signed a three-year work contract with the company, and resignation required a huge breach of contract penalty, so he did not really leave the factory and resign for the postgraduate entrance examination until the end of August when the contract expired. Before calling the online school, I did not know that remote tutoring could be listened to anytime and anywhere, so I only started preparing at the end of August. For his first postgraduate entrance examination, his English was basically zero, and he had learned politics and mathematics since the second year of college, but he had put them down for five years, and at that time, he only barely passed with a score of around 60. After making a call to sign up, I enrolled in the experimental class, hoping to be admitted smoothly with the help of the homeroom teacher in the remaining time. The head teacher asked him if he had any psychological burden to start reviewing now. He said very frankly, ""Since it's already too late, we have to think of a way to catch up. Thinking too much about other things is just a waste of thought."" I resigned, I have time, and I know the difficulties of work, so I will definitely be more willing to learn than them, so I believe I will not fall behind and catch up. This student, relying on his confidence and perseverance, won a master's degree in automation at Northeastern University under the guidance of the head teacher. Northeastern University's automation is well-known nationwide. When someone is admitted, this confidence and perseverance are worth learning from many people. Many people give up on themselves, thinking they won't pass the exam, but at the same time, they are crushing their own confidence and shattering their dreams of becoming a graduate student, what a pity! In Old Man Travels, it says: The world has a limited number of talents, and one should not undervalue oneself! It means that geniuses are rare, and everyone is about the same, so you should never look down on yourself! So when you doubt your own ability, you can say this sentence to yourself, increase your confidence, dispel your inferiority complex, and bravely move forward on the road to postgraduate entrance examination!

棒喝：考研中阿Q精神要不得阿Q是鲁迅先生笔下的人物，所谓的阿Q精神也被中国人熙熙攘攘了几十年，开始的时候这是纯粹的悲剧性人物，围绕他的一些论调多是倾向于批判。但是随着时代变迁，世人观念的改变，很多时候阿Q精神竟被美化成所谓的自我安慰或者说中庸之道，真的是这样么？这里不妄加评断，我们只谈考研中，这种阿Q精神绝对要不得。不能有“自尊癖”阿Q的第一个特点就是“自尊癖”。阿Q本是极卑微的人，他没有家，没有固定的职业，只给人家做短工，没有人真的记得他。然而，阿Q却很自尊，“所有未庄的居民，全不在他眼睛里”，甚至赵太爷儿子进了学，他在精神上也不表示尊崇，以为“我的儿子将比他阔得多”。这种无谓的自尊并不能给我们带来以为的精神上的愉悦，也不会对改变现实有任何的意义。就比如我们总能听到有的考研学生这样说，要是我如何如何，也会怎样怎样，或者是“××大学”有什么好的，我还不愿意去呢，等等，这种毫无意义的夸谈。这里告诫同学们，千万不要像阿Q一样不如人不顺心时，不去想怎么样去争取去努力，而是无端的诋毁或者说大话连篇，这样最终一事无成且永远活在嫉妒中的是你自己。不能“欺弱怕强”阿Q的第二个特点是“欺弱怕强”。阿Q最喜欢与人吵嘴打架，但必估量对手，口呐的他便骂，气力小的他便打。可是，当他在路上遇到“假洋鬼子”时，他脱口说了句“秃儿”，不料被听见了，“假洋鬼子”举起了“哭丧棒”，他便赶紧缩起脖子，等着挨揍，连吃了几棍子，一点不敢反抗。现实社会中，这样欺软怕硬的人处处可见，很是可气。同时，我们说，“欺弱怕强”也并不是单单表现在待人上，就比如在考研过程中，很多同学也都存在着“欺弱怕强”的特点，对于自己感兴趣的科目，学起来觉得得心应手的科目，总是能够优先复习，多复习，愿意去复习；对于那些比较难的科目，自己比较薄弱的环节总想去逃避，总期望能够找到捷径，并不能沉下心来认真对待，总是在下定决心好好学习与不断的自我否定与原谅中徘徊。“欺弱怕强”是一种不去尽力甘于自我欺骗的放弃心理，对你的科目复习与考研成功有着严重的不良影响，同学们一定要摒弃掉这个坏习惯。不能“投机取巧”阿Q的第三个特点是“善于投机”。比如对待革命的态度上，阿Q本来是对革命一向深恶痛绝的，但当他看到“未庄的一群鸟男女(在革命到来之际)的慌张的神情”时，便想：“革命也好罢，革这伙妈妈的命，太可恶！太可恨！便是我，也要投降革命党了。”阿Q革命的目的，不过是为了他自己的利益，“我要什么就是什么，我喜欢谁就是谁”。当然，我们这里说的投机取巧更多的是专注于学习层面的，但是道理是一样的，就是投机取巧不好。投机取巧首先从态度上就走入了误区，考研复习来说，太多的同学不能脚踏实地，总是想着不努力不辛苦就能取得好成绩，殊不知，日子就在这样的蹉跎中白白荒废。书山有路勤为径，学海无涯苦作舟，要想成功必须经过不懈的努力，千万不能侥存投机心理。不能“自欺欺人”阿Q的第四个特点是“自欺欺人”，即“精神胜利法”。阿Q与人家打架吃了亏，心里就想：“我总算被儿子打了，现在世界真不像样，儿子居然打起老子来了。”于是他心满意足，俨然得了胜利似的。有很多人推崇这种精神胜利法，但是学习中，这种精神胜利绝对要不得。我们接触到很多同学，复习的时候总是会有这样一些情况，遇到一些比较难的或者说不太会的题，就会安慰自己说，没事儿，这种题型太偏不太容易考；有时候懒惰不想复习，就会对自己说没什么，我就休息几天，不会有什么影响等等，这都是典型的自欺欺人。自欺欺人实质上是对自己的一种放纵不负责任，无论是对学习还是生活都是不好的，希望同学们能够远离这种“自欺”。不做学习的奴隶阿Q的第五个特点是“奴隶性”。这表现在有些同学的身上就是这样的，不能积极主动的去学习，总是感觉被逼迫着被动的去学。大学之前，大家都是在老师家长的监督管控下学习，学是学了，但是没有养成好的自学习惯，一旦脱离了监控，马上开始懈怠想着放松。这种状态可能在进入大学之前还不是很明显，一旦进入大学，脱离了曾经紧张的学习环境，也不再有老师家长的督促，很大一部分同学都迷失在享乐与松懈的状态下。很多人说现在的大学生在学习上“奴性”很强，主要是不会主动学习，不能主动学习，总是被动被迫着去学。可是对于考研来说，这么长期的一个需要艰苦奋斗的过程，是必须要求大家能够积极主动去学习的，因为没有人去提醒你监督你帮助你，一切都靠你自己，所以，不要做学习的“奴隶”，要做主人。正因为着阿Q的这些典型精神，造成了他悲剧性的一生，我们应该从中得到教训，不能做新时代的阿Q，更不能把阿Q精神带到学习生活中。更多信息请访问：新浪考研频道考研论坛考研博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。	阿Q,鲁迅,赵太爷	正向	"Shock the System: The so-called Aq spirit is not to be encouraged in the postgraduate entrance examination. Aq is a character created by Lu Xun. The so-called Aq spirit has been popular among the Chinese for decades. At the beginning, he was a purely tragic figure, and most of the arguments around him tended to be critical. But with the passage of time and the change of people’s views, the A-Q spirit is often beautified as self-comfort or the middle way. Is it really so? We do not make arbitrary judgments, but in the postgraduate entrance examination, this kind of Qian Zhong spirit is absolutely not to be taken. There should be no ""self-esteem complex"". The first characteristic of Ah Q is ""self-esteem complex"". Ah Q was a very humble person. He had no home and no fixed occupation. He only did short-term work for others, and no one really remembered him. However, Ah Q was very proud, and all the residents of Wenzhuang were not in his eyes, and even when Zhao Taier’s son passed the examination, he did not show respect in spirit, thinking that ""my son will be much richer than him."" This kind of meaningless self-respect cannot bring us any spiritual pleasure, nor does it have any meaning in changing reality. For example, we often hear students who are preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination say that if they were like this or that, they would also be like this or that, or that ""University ××"" has something good, I am not willing to go, and so on, this kind of meaningless boasting. Here, it warns the students not to be like Ah Q, not to think about how to strive and work hard when they are not as good as others, but to slander or talk big without reason, and in the end, you will achieve nothing and live in envy forever. It is not about ""being weak and fearing the strong"". The second characteristic of Ah Q is ""being weak and fearing the strong"". Ah Q was fond of quarreling and fighting with others, but he would always assess his opponent. If the other person was talkative, Ah Q would curse them, and if the other person was weak, Ah Q would beat them. But when he met the “fake foreigner” on the road, he blurted out “bald”, and was heard by the “fake foreigner”, who raised his “funeral stick”. He immediately curled his neck and waited to be beaten, and he took several whacks without daring to resist. In real life, such people who bully the weak and fear the strong are everywhere, and they are really annoying. Moreover, we say that ""being weak and afraid of strong"" is not just reflected in dealing with people. For example, in the process of postgraduate entrance examination, many students also have the characteristics of ""being weak and afraid of strong"". For the subjects that they are interested in and find easy to learn, they can always review them first, review them more, and be willing to review them. For those difficult subjects, they always want to avoid their weak links, always hope to find a shortcut, and cannot take it seriously. They are always hesitating between making up their minds to study hard and self-denial and forgiveness. “Bullied the weak and afraid of the strong” is a kind of giving up mentality that is unwilling to try one's best and deceive oneself, which has a serious negative impact on your subject review and postgraduate entrance examination success. Students must get rid of this bad habit. One cannot be a ""cheater"" as ArQ's third characteristic is ""good at speculation"". For example, in his attitude toward the revolution, Ah Q had always been deeply opposed to it. But when he saw the panic-stricken looks of the crowd of birds and women in Nvzhuang (when the revolution was imminent), he thought, ""Revolution is also good. Get rid of the lives of these damned people, too repulsive!"" Too hateful! And I, too, would surrender to the revolutionaries. The purpose of Ah Q's revolution was merely for his own benefit, ""I take what I want and I like who I like."" Of course, the cunning and deceit we refer to here are more focused on the learning level, but the principle is the same, which is that cunning and deceit are not good. Cheating first of all falls into a wrong attitude. For the review of the postgraduate entrance examination, too many students cannot be down-to-earth, always thinking that without effort and hard work, good results can be achieved, little do they know that time is wasted in such a way. There is a path through the mountain of books for diligence, and a sea of learning without the end of hardship as a boat. In order to succeed, one must work hard without cease, and must not have the mentality of侥幸and speculation. Cannot ""Self-deception"" The fourth feature of Ah Q is ""self-deception"", that is, ""spiritual victory method"". When A-Q lost a fight with someone, he thought to himself, ""I have finally been hit by my son. The world is really not as it should be; my son has actually hit his father. Then he was satisfied, as if he had won a victory. Many people advocate this kind of mental victory, but in learning, this kind of mental victory is absolutely not to be tolerated. We come into contact with many classmates, and there are always such situations when reviewing. When encountering some difficult or not very good questions, we will comfort ourselves that it's okay, this type of question is too biased and not easy to be tested; Sometimes we are lazy and do not want to review, and we will tell ourselves that it's okay, I will rest for a few days, and it will not have any impact, etc. This is typical self-deception. Self-deception is essentially a kind of indulgence and irresponsibility towards oneself, which is not good for either study or life. I hope that all students can stay away from this kind of ""self-deception"". The fifth characteristic of Ah Q, the slave of learning, is ""slavery"". This is manifested in some students who are not proactive in learning and always feel forced to learn passively. Before university, everyone was learning under the supervision and control of teachers and parents. They did learn, but they did not develop good self-study habits. As soon as they were out of the supervision, they started to slack off and think about relaxing. This state may not be obvious before entering university, but once in university, away from the once tense learning environment and without the supervision of teachers and parents, a large part of the students will be lost in the enjoyment and relaxation. Many people say that today's college students are very ""servile"" in their studies, mainly because they are not proactive in learning and cannot learn proactively, always passively and involuntarily. But for the postgraduate entrance examination, such a long-term process that requires hard struggle, it is necessary to require everyone to actively and proactively learn, because no one will remind you, supervise you, or help you, everything depends on yourself, so do not be a ""slave"" of learning, be the master.

“阳光神童”难适留学生活铩羽美国名校新仔走天涯国外大学已经陆续开学有一段时间了，面对全新的生活学习环境，刚去的留学(微博)生特别是一些小留学生们能适应吗？记者了解到，国外的高中教育虽然没有国内高考的压力，但课业其实并不轻松。课业和生活两大压力，使许多从小就没离开过父母的留学生们难以适应，产生了许多问题。17岁的留学生蓉蓉(化名)就面临着这样的压力，她向记者详细讲述了自己从意气风发去留学到无奈“被回国”的经历。她的经历，或许对那些正打算留学的家长和孩子会有些借鉴。我今年17岁，原本应该在国内某个高中读高二，可前不久我却躲在异国他乡的宿舍里蒙头痛哭。当时我已经很久没有见到爸爸妈妈和以前的同学了，而新的老师和同学我也不想见。终于，我的状况让学校知道了，结果被学校劝回国休学。意气风发：“阳光神童”赴美从小，我就被认为是一个智力超群的女孩，不用付出太多的努力，班里的“头把交椅”就一定是我的。我自认长得也颇过得去，由于经常骑自行车外出郊游，皮肤晒成了健康的小麦色，被周围人赋予了“阳光神童”的美誉。我很喜欢这个绰号。爸爸、妈妈对我寄予了厚望，我也没感受到多大的压力，以我平日的水准，出人头地并非遥不可及。我所在的城市虽然不大，但大家都对孩子的教育非常重视，受周围环境影响，爸爸妈妈在我初二结束时就问我，要不要也去国外完成高中学业，然后顺理成章地挑一所合适的大学继续深造？我的回答当然是“好”，能去一个陌生的国度、接受更棒的教育，这是多么充满诱惑啊！其实我早盘算好了，先去读美国排名前100位的高中，然后再选一所常春藤名校深造，把自己打造成一个学贯中西的精英人物。爸妈很支持我的想法，虽然我们家不算很富裕，而美国排名前100的高中大部分都是私立的，学费非常昂贵，可父母还是咬牙凑出了巨额学费。在经过漫长而复杂的申请、面试、签证等阶段后，初三的暑假，我来到了梦中的美国。回想当时，我是多么踌躇满志、意气风发呀。渐觉失落：发现事事不如人我一直听说，中国的基础教育是世界领先的，所以从不认为自己在学习上会有什么障碍。可事实发现，原来不是。刚开学我就遇到了困难——选课。美国的高中是选课制的，只要在毕业时修完所有的学分就行，至于每年修什么课程由学生自己看着办，完全没有老师指导。在我的概念中，学习不一直都是老师说什么、学生学什么吗？对此，远在国内的父母帮不了我，而周围的同学和老师也不愿帮我，因为在他们看来，这是我的事情，别人不方便插手。于是，在惶恐中我选了一些原来在国内还挺擅长的科目，并且在课程的深度上也选择了中上级别。可是读了一星期，就发现不对劲了。首先是语言，虽然我英语没大问题，但用英语来听课和思考的速度，显然跟不上老师讲解的速度，为此我不得不花更多时间啃书本。那些科目的程度很深，也很难，更要命的是，每天都有大量的回家作业，而这些作业不仅仅是做题，还包括了查资料、做实践、表明自己的论点等，而这些都没有标准答案可循，需要学生综合自己的所学和能力交出答卷。这下我彻底懵了。“第一”好像已是前世的回忆。彻底崩溃：借酒消愁被劝退另一个让我不适应的地方在课外。由于我申请的高中排名非常靠前，云集了来自美国中产阶级家庭的孩子，他们从小受过非常良好的教育，这种教育远远不只是学业上的，而是全方位的。这些孩子都能文能武，每人都有自己擅长的体育和文艺科目。可对从小只重视数理化，忽略其他一切与考试无关的我来说，课外兴趣和爱好几乎是空白。虽然在国内，我经常以“全面发展”为荣，可仅仅是发展了一下，并不精通。对什么都不会的我，美国的同学报以克制但惊讶的眼光，这种眼光生生地把我隔离在他们的世界之外。学习上跟得吃力，生活上处于边缘，我的压力越来越大。我明明已经很努力了，作业还是完不成，考试还是通不过，那些该死的体育、乐器、艺术类课程统统跟不上，甚至去跑个马拉松，我都因晕厥要被送到校医疗站，为什么我到了美国成了弱者！我想不通，觉得周围人都看不起我，于是越来越封闭自己，整天把自己关在宿舍里发呆。我经常在深夜独自跑去学校的操场默默流泪，开始拒绝做一切作业，对偶尔表示关心的同学置之不理。最后，我甚至拒绝继续学习，经常旷课，偷偷买回大瓶烈性酒把自己灌醉，躲在被子里抽泣。终于有一天校方找到我，建议我休学一段时间调整状态和情绪。就这样，崩溃的我被送回了国……留学生要做好心理准备应对中西文化冲击专家解读业内专家表示，从“阳光神童”的案例可以看出，导致她无法顺利适应留美生活的根本原因在于，她对西方教育、文化没有做好充分了解，心理无法应对好中西文化冲击。她希望在留学期间同样保持“学习成绩优异的优越感”，“做同学们的榜样”。可她不明白，国内的“第一”与国外的“第一”大不相同。在国外，要成为“第一”意味着综合能力十分强，比如学习成绩优秀、有特长、博学健谈、社交能力强(甚至有领导力)、社会经验丰富、有社会责任感等，而不只是学业优秀。她应该以积极的心态去看待自己与别人的不同，让自己的内心更强大，增强抗压意识，学会用多元思维看待事物，并且用有效的方法不断地提升自己，而不是一味地否定自己。家长方面，必须在出国这个问题上与孩子充分沟通，根据孩子的性格、英语能力、发展方向来决定是否出国。对于学生而言，必须在出国之前多浏览网站，了解更多有关国外教育、社会、法律方面的相关知识。对于有责任的留学服务机构而言，由于他们拥有大量第一手的海外信息和留学生资源，所以，应该在学生出国前，安排好生活、文化、心理层面的系统离境辅导服务。此外，专家建议，学生在选课之前，最好去请教一下已经修过这门课的同学，以便了解课程的难度。刚抵外国的留学生可以去国际学生事务处，多询问关于选课、生活和学习的问题。还可选择自己感兴趣的社团，认识新朋友，融入大家庭，接受新文化。(记者：李琼)	蓉蓉,李琼	负向	"The ""sunshine prodigy"" is difficult to adapt to the life of studying abroad and returns empty-handed. New students of American top universities have traveled abroad. Foreign universities have been open for a period of time. Facing a new life and learning environment, can new students who just go abroad adapt, especially some little students? Journalists have learned that although overseas high school education does not have the pressure of the college entrance examination in China, the academic workload is actually not light. Academic and life pressures make it difficult for many international students, who have never left their parents since childhood, to adapt and generate many problems. Rongrong, a 17-year-old exchange student (a pseudonym), is facing such pressure. She told the reporter in detail about her experience from going to study abroad with high spirits to reluctantly returning home. Her experience may be of some reference to those parents and children who are planning to study abroad. I am 17 years old, and I should be in a high school in my country, studying in the second year of high school, but a few days ago, I was hiding in the dormitory of a foreign country, sobbing in pain. At that time, I hadn't seen my parents and old classmates for a long time, and I also didn't want to see the new teachers and classmates. Finally, my condition was known to the school, and as a result, I was advised to return home and take a leave of absence. With great enthusiasm: ""Sun God Child"" went to America. Since I was a little girl, I was always considered a girl with extraordinary intelligence, and the ""top chair"" in the class was always mine without much effort. I think I look pretty good, and because I often ride a bicycle for outings, my skin has been tanned into a healthy wheat color, and I have been given the美誉of ""Sunshine Child"" by those around me. I really like this nickname. My parents had high expectations for me, and I didn’t feel much pressure. With my usual level of performance, standing out was not out of reach. Though my city is not big, everyone is very concerned about the education of children. Affected by the surrounding environment, my parents asked me whether I wanted to go abroad to complete my high school studies when I finished my second year of junior high school, and then naturally choose a suitable university for further study. Of course, my answer is ""yes"". How tempting it is to go to a foreign country and receive even better education! Actually, I had already calculated it in the morning, to first read in high schools in the top 100 in the United States, and then choose a prestigious Ivy League school for further study, and to shape myself into an elite with a broad knowledge of both Chinese and Western cultures. My parents strongly support my idea. Although our family is not very wealthy, most of the top 100 high schools in the United States are private, and the tuition is very expensive. However, my parents still gritted their teeth and raised a huge amount of tuition. After a long and complex application, interview, visa, and other stages, I arrived in the United States, which I had dreamed of during my third-year summer vacation. Back then, I was full of confidence and ambition. Gradually, I felt lost: I always heard that China's basic education was world-leading, so I never thought I would have any obstacles in my studies. In fact, it turned out not to be the case. I encountered difficulties right from the start - course selection. High schools in the United States are elective systems, and as long as all the credits are completed when graduating, it is up to the students to decide what courses to take each year, with no guidance from teachers at all. Is learning always what the teacher says and what the student learns in my concept? For this, my parents far away at home could not help me, and my classmates and teachers around me were unwilling to help me, as they believed that it was my own matter and that others were not convenient to intervene. So, in fear, I chose some subjects that I was quite good at back in China, and I also chose a medium to high level in terms of course depth. But after reading it for a week, I found something was wrong. First of all, there is the language. Although I have no problem with English, the speed at which I can listen to and think in English is obviously not fast enough to keep up with the teacher's explanation. Therefore, I have to spend more time reading books. The subjects are very deep and difficult, and the worst part is that there is a large amount of homework every day, and the homework is not just doing exercises, but also includes looking up materials, doing practical work, and presenting one's own arguments, and there are no standard answers for these, and students need to submit their answers by combining their own learning and abilities. Now I am completely lost. ""First"" seems to be a recollection of a past life. Total collapse: drinking to drown my sorrows was discouraged. Another thing that was not to my liking was extracurricular activities. Because the high school I applied to was very prestigious, and it was full of children from middle-class American families who had received very good education from a very young age, which was not just academic, but all-round. These children are both literary and martial, each excelling in a sport and an artistic subject. For someone who has always been focused on math, physics, and chemistry, and ignored everything else that is not related to exams, extracurricular interests and hobbies are almost blank. Although I often take pride in being ""all-round"" in China, I have only developed a little and am not an expert. With my complete ignorance, my American classmates gave me a restrained but surprised look, which isolated me from their world. I find it difficult to keep up with my studies and I am on the fringes of life, and my pressure is getting bigger and bigger. I tried my best, but I still couldn't finish my homework, and I still couldn't pass the exam. I couldn't keep up with those damn sports, music, and art classes, and even when I ran a marathon, I fainted and had to be sent to the school medical station. Why did I become a weak person in America! I can't understand, I think everyone around me looks down on me, so I am more and more closed, and I stay in the dormitory all day long, staring blankly. I often go to the school playground alone in the middle of the night and cry silently, and then I start to refuse to do all the homework and ignore the classmates who occasionally show concern. Finally, I even refused to continue studying, often skipping classes, secretly buying a large bottle of strong liquor to get drunk, and sobbing under the quilt. Finally, one day the school found me and suggested that I take a leave of absence for a while to adjust my state and mood. And so, the broken me was sent back home... Overseas students should be mentally prepared to deal with the impact of cultural shock between the East and the West. Experts in the industry explain that from the case of the ""sunshine prodigy"", it can be seen that the fundamental reason why she could not adapt to her life in the United States smoothly is that she did not have a full understanding of Western education and culture, and her psychology could not cope with the impact of cultural shock between the East and the West. She hopes to maintain the sense of superiority of ""excellent academic performance"" and ""serve as a model for classmates"" during her study abroad. But she did not understand that the ""first"" in China was very different from the ""first"" abroad. Abroad, being a ""first"" means having a comprehensive ability, such as excellent academic performance, special skills, being well-read and eloquent, strong social skills (even leadership), rich social experience, and social responsibility, rather than just excellent academic performance. She should view her differences from others with a positive attitude, making her inner self stronger, enhancing her stress resistance awareness, learning to view things with a multi-dimensional mindset, and continuously improving herself with effective methods, rather than always negating herself. Parents must communicate fully with their children on the issue of going abroad, and decide whether to go abroad based on their children's personality, English ability, and development direction. For students, it is necessary to browse the website more before going abroad to learn more about the relevant knowledge of foreign education, society, and law. For responsible overseas study service agencies, since they have a large amount of first-hand overseas information and overseas student resources, they should arrange systematic departure counseling services for students before they go abroad, covering aspects such as life, culture, and psychology. Moreover, experts suggest that students should consult with classmates who have already taken the course to get a sense of the difficulty. Newly arrived international students can go to the International Student Affairs Office to ask more questions about course selection, life, and study. You can also choose clubs of your interest, make new friends, integrate into the big family, and accept new cultures. (Reporter: Li Qiong)"

侯耀文小女友被曝净身出户时报讯因追加两项起诉内容而推迟审理的“侯门遗产”一案，经过了十几天默默无闻的蛰伏，前日，侯瓒代理律师苏向祥表示，在法院调查取证当天，侯耀华一方无人到场，据分析，被告可能提出管辖权异议。8月4日，本案原告侯瓒新增两项要求，再次向北京西城法院递交起诉状：一、侯耀文的所有银行账户要查明，因为此前法院查侯耀文财产时，只查了4家银行，其余银行未查；二、侯耀文葬礼上亲朋的份子钱，加上侯耀文徒弟每人出了1万元，两项加起来约60万元也在被告侯耀华手里，这也要追加进来。为此，原定7月30日开庭并网络直播的案件推迟审理，双方进入答辩状整理阶段。如今，十几天时间过去，苏向祥律师称，截至昨日下午5时，双方证据整理时间结束，需向法院提交新修答辩状。另据报道，被侯瓒起诉的三人中并未出现父亲侯耀文的小女友陈一嘉的名字，对此，网上一直有人猜测，小女友陈一嘉免遭起诉，原因在于侯耀文遗体告别仪式上，侯瓒看到父亲两位前妻都未出席，只有跟自己差不多大的陈一嘉“忙前忙后”，感动之余产生动容之情。对此，苏向祥称“没有这回事”。他表示，陈一嘉离开玫瑰园时可谓净身出户，“就我方现有证据显示，陈一嘉离开玫瑰园时主要带走了一些属于她的衣物等私人物品。法院如果认为有必要，才会追加”。近日，还不满30岁的陈一嘉在博客上载了许多美国游记，看来已摆脱掉案件影响的她，开始了自己的全新生活。另外，就侯耀文前两任妻子未出席追悼会一事，苏律师表示这是“情理之中，毕竟现在大家都有了各自生活”。	侯耀文,侯瓒,苏向祥,苏,侯耀华,陈一嘉	正向	"Hou Yaowen's young girlfriend was reported to leave the house clean. The case of ""House of Hou's inheritance"" was postponed for trial due to the addition of two more claims. After ten days of silent and unobserved, Hou Zan's lawyer Su Xiangxiang said that on the day of the court's investigation and evidence collection, Hou Yaowen's side was not present. It is analyzed that the defendant may raise an objection to the jurisdiction. On August 4, the plaintiff Hou Zan added two new requests and resubmitted the complaint to the Xicheng Court of Beijing again: 1. All of Hou Yaowen's bank accounts should be investigated, because when the court investigated Hou Yaowen's property before, only four banks were investigated, and the rest of the banks were not investigated; 2. The wedding gifts of friends and relatives at Hou Yaowen's funeral, plus each of Hou Yaowen's disciples paid 10,000 yuan, the total of the two is about 600,000 yuan, which is also in Hou Yaohua's hands, and this should also be added. As a result, the case was postponed for trial and live streaming on the Internet, and both sides entered the stage of organizing the pleadings. Now, after more than ten days, Su Xiangxiang, the lawyer, said that the time for both sides to sort out the evidence had ended by 5 p.m. yesterday, and they needed to submit a new answer to the court. It was also reported that Chen Yijia, the young girlfriend of Hou Yaowen, was not mentioned in the three people who were sued by Hou Zan. There have been speculations online that Chen Yijia was not sued because she was seen to be ""busy"" at the farewell ceremony of Hou Yaowen, while his two ex-wives did not attend, and Hou Zan was moved by this. Su Xiangxiang said there was no such thing. He said that Chen Yijia left the Rose Garden with nothing, ""According to the evidence we currently have, Chen Yijia mainly took some of her own clothes and other personal items when she left the Rose Garden."" The court may add to it only if it deems it necessary. Recently, Chen Yijia, who is not yet 30 years old, uploaded many travel diaries of the United States on her blog. It seems that she has started her new life after摆脱掉the impact of the case. As for Su’s statement that the two previous wives of Hou Yaowen did not attend the memorial service, it was “expected, after all, everyone now has their own lives.”"

《超人前传》第八季九月回归几大主角发生巨变新浪娱乐讯在即将播出的第八季中，《超人前传》(Smallville)将经历一次重大的变革。近日在圣地亚哥动漫展上，四位制作人凯莉-桑德斯(KellySouders)、布莱恩-彼得森(BrianPeterson)、托德-斯拉维京(ToddSlavkin)、戴伦-斯维默(DarrenSwimmer)介绍了新的一季，仍然收到很多剧迷的欢迎。虽然还是《超人前传》，但是很多角色都将发生变化。目前可以确定的是，男主角克拉克(Clark)将在第八季里正式转变为超人。除了开始双重身份的生活外，他还将与埃莉卡-杜兰斯(EricaDurance)扮演的露易丝-莱恩(LoisLane)一起去星球日报工作。有些剧迷可能会担心《超人前传》变得跟90年代电视连续剧《超人》(Lois&Clark)雷同，但是制作人彼得森保证不会发生这样的情况。“那不是我们这部剧的风格，也不是观众熟悉的我们的角色的风格。”他介绍说，两人在一起工作会擦出火花，也有关系紧张的时候，因此会很有看头，但整体人物风格不会改变。除了克拉克与露易丝擦出火花，在第八季中，克拉克与克洛伊(Chloe)之间的关系也是很有看头的。“两人之间会有很多暗藏的压力，性关系的压力，感情的压力。”彼得森介绍说。在展览中，制作人没有透露莱克斯-卢瑟(LexLuthor)的扮演者迈克尔-罗森鲍姆(MichaelRosenbaum)是否会回到剧中，但是他们透露拉娜-朗(LanaLang)的扮演者克斯汀-克鲁克(KristinKreuk)将回归。第八季的第五集，她将再次出现，不过很有可能不再是观众熟悉的那个拉娜了。斯拉维京介绍说：“她看起来不同了，不再是我们熟悉的拉娜。她长大了，离开了小镇，以一个女人的身份回来。很显然结婚使她变成一个女人，但是她其实还是个孩子。”拉娜开始了新生活，而贾斯汀-哈特利(JustinHartley)扮演的奥利弗-奎恩(OliverQueen)将探求自己的过去，他将揭示绿箭的起源。将一起探究奥利弗是如何变成绿箭的，为什么是他成为绿箭，以及他是如何学会射箭的。哈特利还谈了他的角色面临的挑战。奥利弗将有点伤心，他开始审视自己为之牺牲的东西，想知道究竟值不值得。《超人前传》第八季9月18日晚回归。龙龙/文声明：新浪网独家稿件，转载请注明出处。	凯莉-桑德斯,桑德斯,布莱恩-彼得森,彼得森,托德-斯拉维京,斯拉维京,戴伦-斯维默,斯维默,克拉克,埃莉卡-杜兰斯,杜兰斯,露易丝-莱恩,露易丝,LoisLane,克洛伊,莱克斯-卢瑟,卢瑟,迈克尔,迈克尔-罗森鲍姆,罗森鲍姆,拉娜,克鲁克,贾斯汀-哈特利,哈特利,奥利弗,奥利弗-奎恩,绿箭,龙龙	正向	"In the upcoming eighth season of Smallville, a major change will occur. Smallville will return in September, and several major characters will change. Recently, at the San Diego Comic Con, four producers Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson, Todd Slavkin, and Darren Swimmer introduced a new season, which is still very popular with many fans. Although it is still Smallville, many characters will change. It can be confirmed that the male lead Clark will officially transform into Superman in the eighth season. Besides leading a double life, he will also work for the Daily Planet with Lois Lane, played by Erica Durance. Some fans may worry that Smallville will be too much like the 1990s TV series Lois & Clark, but producer Peterson assures that this will not happen. That's not the style of our play, nor is it the style of the characters that our audience is familiar with. He introduced that the two of them would spark when they worked together, and there would also be times of tense relationships, so it would be very interesting to watch, but the overall character style would not change. Besides the sparks between Clark and Louise, the relationship between Clark and Chloe in the eighth season is also very interesting. There will be a lot of hidden pressure between the two of them, sexual pressure, emotional pressure. Peterson introduced. At the convention, the producers did not reveal whether or not the actor who played Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum, would return to the show, but they did reveal that the actress who played Lana Lang, Kristin Kreuk, would return. In the fifth episode of the eighth season, she will appear again, but it is very likely that she will no longer be the Lana that the audience is familiar with. Slavikin introduced, ""She looks different, no longer the Lana we are familiar with."" She grew up, left the town, and came back as a woman. Obviously, marriage made her a woman, but she was still a child. Lana began a new life, while Oliver Queen, played by Justin Hartley, will explore his past, revealing the origins of the Green Arrow. We will explore how Oliver became the Arrow, why it was him, and how he learned to shoot an arrow. Hartley also talked about the challenges his role faced. Oliver will be a little sad, he will start to review what he has sacrificed for, and wonder whether it is worth it. Supernatural season 8 will return on September 18th.

比利时球王携幼子参加中国公开赛爱妻身材火辣(图)3月28日下午，使用星牌台球桌的2010三元食品世界斯诺克中国公开赛在球手下榻的新世纪日航饭店召开了新闻发布会。除了诸多世界顶级球星之外，会场上还有一位来宾引起了记者们的兴趣，那就是比利时球手汉尼威尔的女友黛西。彼乔恩-汉尼威尔是比利时最为著名的斯诺克球手，他曾夺得过六次比利时斯诺克锦标赛的冠军，欧洲锦标赛和世界运动会也都曾稳定或跻身三甲。2003年在德国进行的欧洲锦标赛和07年的比利时锦标赛上，汉尼威尔还都打出了147的满分杆。平时还会为荷兰语的欧洲体育台进行解说。另外，汉尼威尔也是目前职业台球界唯一的比利时球员，03/04赛季世界排名达到最高的第53名。阔别职业巡回赛两个赛季之后，汉尼威尔凭借08/09赛季庞汀斯系列赛第四名的成绩于09/10赛季重回职业巡回赛。09/10赛季汉尼威尔不但通过了中国公开赛的资格赛，还在世锦赛的资格赛上打出单杆138分刷新了个人职业生涯的单杆最高分。实际上，这并不是汉尼威尔第一次来到中国，2000年中国公开赛，汉尼威尔曾以3-5不敌亨德利，首轮出局。这一次，汉尼威尔并非只身前来。身为父亲的他，不但将“孩儿他娘”黛西带来了北京，就连还叼着奶嘴的小宝宝也一同带了来。已为人母的黛西依然保养得很好，黑色低胸装让她的火辣身材一览无余，不知道秒杀了多少记者们的镜头。看来，这次汉尼威尔是计划带着家人好好游览一下初春的京城了。只是希望下周的北京不要像前几天那样猛刮沙尘暴才好，和风暖阳才是春游的好天气嘛！不过，坐在球员席的汉尼威尔却似乎并没有引起太多记者的注意，大家的目光仍然都集中在希金斯、丁俊晖和亨德利等超级大牌的身上，这也使得汉尼威尔并不是唯一受到如此“冷遇”的球手。虽然迈克劳德是当今黑人中斯诺克打得最好的，虽然瓦塔纳和苏珀分别是泰国过去和现在的顶尖人物，但他们的的行动和就自由多了。迈克劳德在酒店里面来去自由，闲庭信步地听着音乐闲逛，穿梭于球迷之间却没有人找他签名，瓦塔纳和苏珀更是在一位泰国球迷的陪同下，出去转悠找吃的去了。(TOP147.汐凉)	汉尼威尔,黛西,乔恩-汉尼威尔,亨德利,希金斯,丁俊晖,迈克劳德,瓦塔纳,苏珀,汐凉	正向	"Belgium's king of the ball and his young son participated in the Chinese Open, his wife's figure was spicy (picture) on the afternoon of March 28, the 2010 San Yuan food world snooker Chinese Open, using the Star brand billiard table, was held at the news conference of the hotel where the players stayed, the new century Japan Airlines Hotel. Besides many world-class stars, there was also a guest who attracted the attention of the reporters, Daisy, the girlfriend of the Belgian player Hanniwell. Joey Hannifield is one of the most famous snooker players in Belgium, having won six Belgian snooker championships, and has also consistently finished in the top three in the European Championship and the World Games. Hanniford also achieved a maximum break of 147 at the European Championship in Germany in 2003 and at the Belgian Championship in 2007. He also does commentary for the Dutch-language Eurosport channel on a regular basis. Additionally, Hannewell is the only Belgian player in the current professional snooker world, reaching the highest world ranking of 53rd in the 03/04 season. After two seasons away from the professional tour, Hannaford returned to the professional tour in the 2009/10 season, following his fourth-place finish in the Pinty's Series in the 2008/09 season. In the 2009-10 season, Hanniford not only qualified for the Chinese Open, but also scored 138 points in the World Championship qualifier, setting a new personal best. Actually, this is not the first time Hannewell has come to China. In the 2000 China Open, Hannewell lost 3-5 to Hendry and was eliminated in the first round. This time, Honeywell was not alone. As a father, he brought his ""child's mother"" Daisy to Beijing, and even brought the baby who was still sucking on the pacifier. Daisy, who has already given birth, is still well taken care of. The black low-cut dress reveals her spicy figure, and it is unknown how many journalists' lenses have been killed. It seems that HN威 is planning to take his family on a good tour of the early spring capital. I just hope that next week's Beijing will not be as windy as the last few days, and that a gentle breeze and warm sunshine will be the best weather for a spring outing! However, Hannewell, who was sitting in the players' seats, did not seem to attract much attention from the reporters, and everyone's eyes were still focused on the super stars such as Higgins, Ding Junhui and Hendry, which also made Hannewell not the only player to receive such ""cold"" treatment. Although McLoud is the best at snooker among the blacks today, although Vattana and Suprabh are respectively the top players of Thailand in the past and present, their actions and freedom are much more. McLoud was free to move around the hotel, strolling around and listening to music, and no one asked him for an autograph as he passed through the fans. Vatanan and Supper went out with a Thai fan to look for food. (TOP147, Xi Liang)"
专辑《15》引两极评论方大同：我不要那么暴力早前在台湾宣传新碟时，方大同被颁发“小巨肺”。在新碟中，他作出不少新尝试。●时隔3年，方大同推出全新创作专辑《15》，包办全碟作曲与编曲，还写了超过一般的歌词。如此投入与卖力，却引发争议。●本报鉴定：音乐人真不易做，不变，会被指责“固步自封”；一旦改变不大，则容易被说“浅尝辄止”。其实对于大部分乐迷来说，能被几首歌打动，让耳朵获得数十分钟享受，就够了吧。南都讯记者朱燕霞实习生黄丹婷戴黑框眼镜、穿格子衬衫，唱着骚灵和R&B的音乐，这是一贯的方大同。不温不火，这是外界给予他个人及其音乐风格最多的评价。但这一次，新专辑《15》似乎有了变化：评论两极化，一贯的喜爱与直接的抗拒——有人喜见他的新突破，他融合蓝调、Rock、骚灵、R&B多种音乐类型的尝试；也有人大失所望，对他的唱腔演绎、浅白歌词、主题概念等都一一诟病。“这张专辑无论在音乐上及我想与大家分享的故事或思考的内容，对我是一项挑战，同时对听众亦会是个挑战”，方大同在专辑中这么写，对于听众可能出现的反应，他似乎早已预见。本月初，方大同带着个人第五张创作大碟《15》到内地多个城市巡回宣传，前天下午，他与南都记者在广州见面，聊起《15》引发的很不客气的争议之声，最后还聊起了他“烂gag王”。方大同说：“这张专辑的制作是最好的，新的变化、新的标准是更好的，但我做的是黑人音乐。”争议1新花样浅尝辄止回应：这就是我想做的摇滚新专辑共收录了11首歌，由方大同、EdwardChan、CharlesLee负责监制，方大同包办了全碟的作曲与编曲，还填写了超过一半的歌词。专辑大体上延续其以往积极正面的歌曲态度及清新的感觉，连劝诫年轻人勿吸食毒品的《无菇朋友》，旋律照样清新雅致。尽管如此，方大同对音乐的求变态度，在该专辑中也能体现。比如在演绎上不再是“一人骚”，而是拉上陈兆基、李一丁两位新拍档组成的乐队；在编曲上，复古吉他音效和长号组、solo段落、老式灵歌的唱腔等对乐迷而言都相当有新鲜感。对于这种变化，有人觉得欣喜，但也有人认为一切变化都只是“浅尝辄止”，在Bandsound之中，方大同的唱腔没有很好表现，摇滚做得“不够彻底”。面对这些质疑，方大同回应：“虽然都是黑人音乐，R&B就比较温和轻唱，蓝调的唱腔就会多一点态度，多一点点玩声音的部分。(演唱部分)要盖过乐队是很容易做出来的，只要我混音时候调大(就可以)。有人觉得摇滚就一定要让人声盖过所有的乐器，但我觉得没必要，我觉得不只要让乐迷听到人的声音，也要听编曲上的东西。”方大同说，他所喜欢的摇滚是如JimiHendrix(吉米·亨德里克斯)、TheWhiteStripes(白色条纹乐队)那一类城市骚灵风格的音乐，“有的人觉得做了摇滚，可能又觉得我做的摇滚不够彻底的，但他懂的摇滚只是一部分。”争议2歌词简单内容单薄回应：我不需要那么直白一直以来坚持做创作的方大同，这次在词作上比以往投入了更多的精力，11首歌中有8首词作都有他的参与，但质量却受到诸多诟病。有乐评人认为，这次“少了周耀辉的加持，方大同的音乐就像缺了一条伏线”，不少乐迷也认为歌词过于简单而令内容过于单薄，削弱了歌曲的意境。甚至有歌迷误解了歌词的意思，其中清新文雅的《无菇朋友》原来是“反毒”题材就让不少人愣了愣。南都记者将这个问题抛给方大同，他哈哈笑了几声，说：“我不需要那么直白，那么暴力。我看某些英文歌词也不太明白，要慢慢研究。有的歌写出来，除非他(指词作者)坐下跟你谈，你才可能完全明白他的意思。比如《无菇朋友》里，的‘我走过红地毯’，看过(引发我灵感的新闻)报道就知道，这句话的意思是警察到了，地毯全都是血，而且有人死在沙发上……”方大同解释，“我一向有写词，这次写多了是因为很多曲子不适合之前帮我写过词的人。这次风格是蓝调摇滚，句子的结构、所配合的唱腔，其实不是太适合一般中文的作词方式。”专辑名解析15，是方大同开始学吉他的年龄专辑命名为“15”，这个数字是方大同开始学吉他的年龄，也意味着他这次要回归与吉他相关的内容。音乐风格方面，他在骚灵及R&B的基础上，用蓝调和Rock进行点缀，做一张“UrbanBlues/Rock”(注：城市布鲁斯/摇滚乐)。他介绍，此番尝试是受到JohnMayer(约翰。梅尔)《Contin-uum》的启发，以及蓝调吉他手EricClapton(埃里克·帕特里克·克莱普顿)、JimiHendrix(吉米·亨德里克斯)、B.B.King等的人影响。加上他在生活中有了更多的观察体验，而在歌中触及环保、反毒、爱情婚姻等内容。题外话听方大同讲烂Gag方大同总是让人感觉“温和正经”：他习惯去同一家餐厅，点固定几个菜；他说话声音不会太大，语速也不会太快，温文有礼；他绯闻不多，常常歌唱爱情但感情空窗期已有六年。专辑《15》不例外地有多首爱情歌曲，如受电影《叶问2》启发写下《张永成》描述叶问渴望回家看妻儿，《情胜策略》批判时下年轻人将爱情当游戏，《二人游》讲一个男生第三者说不……谈到爱情话题，方大同说自己心仪的对象仍未出现，但希望35岁前结婚。方大同说自己是个慢热的人，“我喜欢观察，喜欢听，但在朋友中也算是比较多话。”记者顺水推舟请方大同讲个冷笑话，他说：“讲完怕你对我印象不好”，随后还是贡献了两个小段子：“别人问我，为什么自己没有打算结婚没有交女朋友，我说看缘分嘛，工作太忙，录音制作的。他不相信，我说你看我微博，因为我要混音，所以没有婚姻。”“我有个发型师叫做Carl，别人问我他在哪，我说在停车场。”(Carl与car——汽车——发音相近)	方大同,朱燕霞,黄丹婷,EdwardChan,CharlesLee,无菇,陈兆基,李一丁,吉米·亨德里克斯,亨德里克斯,周耀辉,JohnMayer,梅尔,埃里克·帕特里克·克莱普顿,克莱普顿,B.B.King,张永成,Carl	正向	"Album ""15"" has received polarizing reviews, Fang Datong: I don't want to be so violent. Earlier, when promoting his new album in Taiwan, Fang Datong was awarded ""Little Giant Lung"". On his new album, he has made many new attempts. ●After three years, Fang Datong has released a new creation album, ""15"", which he has written all the music and arrangements, and also written more lyrics than usual. So much effort and enthusiasm, but it has sparked controversy. ●Our report: It is really not easy to be a musician. If you don't change, you will be criticized for ""stagnation""; if you change a little, you will be easily accused of ""shallow"". Actually, for most fans, being moved by a few songs and enjoying dozens of minutes of listening is enough. South Daily News, Zhu Yanxia, intern Huang Danting, wearing black-framed glasses, wearing a checkered shirt, singing soul and R&B music, this is Fang Datong's usual appearance. Not too hot or too cold, this is the most common evaluation given to him and his musical style by the outside world. But this time, the new album 15 seems to have changed: reviews are polarized, with consistent praise and direct rejection – some are delighted by his new breakthrough, his attempt to blend blues, rock, soul, and R&B; others are deeply disappointed, criticizing his vocal performance, the shallow lyrics, and the theme concept, etc. “With this album, both musically and in the stories and thoughts I want to share with you, it is a challenge for me, and also for the listeners,” Fang DaTong wrote in the album, and it seems that he has already foreseen the possible reactions of the listeners. At the beginning of this month, Fang Datong brought his fifth original album, 15, to the mainland for a tour promotion. Yesterday afternoon, he met with Nan Du journalists in Guangzhou and talked about the very unkind controversy caused by 15, and finally talked about his ""King of Bad Jokes"". Fang Datong said, ""The production of this album is the best, the new changes and new standards are better, but what I do is black music."" Controversy 1 New Fad Tasting Response: This is what I want to do with the new rock album, which includes 11 songs, produced by Fang Datong, Edward Chan, and Charles Lee. Fang Datong is responsible for all the composition and arrangement of the album, and also wrote more than half of the lyrics. The album largely continues its previous positive and fresh song attitude, and even the song ""No Mushrooms Friends"" that advises young people not to take drugs has a fresh and elegant melody. Nevertheless, Fang Datong’s attitude of seeking change in music can also be seen in this album. For example, in terms of performance, it is no longer ""one person's madness"", but a band composed of two new partners, Chen Zhaogui and Li Yiding; in terms of arrangement, the retro guitar sound effect, the long horn group, the solo section, and the singing style of the old spiritual song are all very fresh to the fans. Some people are happy about this change, but others think that all changes are just ""a taste"" and that Fang Datong's singing style is not well expressed in Bandsound, and that the rock music is not done thoroughly enough. In response to these doubts, Fang Datong replied, ""Although they are all black music, R&B is more gentle and soft, while the blues has more attitude and a bit more play with sound."" It is easy to make the singing part cover the band, as long as I turn it up when mixing. Some people think that rock music should always have the vocals overpower all the instruments, but I don't think that's necessary. I think it's important to not only hear the human voice, but also the arrangement. Fang Datong said that the rock music he likes is the kind of urban soul music like Jimi Hendrix and The White Stripes. Some people may think that the rock music I have done is not thorough enough, but he only understands a part of rock music. Controversy 2 lyrics are simple and thin response: I don't need to be so direct. Fang Datong, who has always been committed to creation, has invested more energy in the lyrics this time. 11 songs have 8 lyrics with his participation, but the quality has received much criticism. Some music critics believe that Fang DaTong's music is like missing a thread without Zhou YaoHui's support. Many music fans also think that the lyrics are too simple, which makes the content too thin and weakens the atmosphere of the song. Even fans misunderstood the meaning of the lyrics. The fresh and elegant ""No Mushrooms"" was originally a ""anti-drug"" theme, which made many people stunned. The Southern Metropolis Daily reporter threw this question to Fang Datong, who laughed and said, ""I don't need to be that direct and violent."" I don't understand some English lyrics, I have to study them slowly. Some songs can only be fully understood if the lyricist sits down and talks to you. For example, in ""My Red Carpet,"" the line ""I walked over the red carpet,"" which means that the police had arrived and the carpet was all blood, and someone had died on the sofa, according to the news report that inspired me. Fang Datong explained, ""I usually write lyrics, but this time I wrote more because many of the songs were not suitable for the people who had written lyrics for me before."" This time, the style is blues rock, and the sentence structure and the singing style actually do not suit the general Chinese lyrics writing method too much. Album Name Analysis 15, Fang Datong named the album ""15"" because it is the age when he started to learn the guitar, and it also means that he will return to guitar-related content this time. In terms of music style, he will use blues and rock to decorate soul and R&B, and make an ""UrbanBlues/Rock"" (i.e. urban blues/rock). He introduced that this attempt was inspired by John Mayer (John. Inspired by Mel (Contin-uum) and blues guitarists Eric Clapton (埃里克·帕特里克·克莱普顿), Jimi Hendrix (吉米·亨德里克斯), B.B. King, etc. With more life experiences, he also touched on environmental protection, anti-drug, love and marriage in his songs. Off the record, Fang Datong talks about his ""boring"" jokes. Fang Datong always gives people the impression of being ""gentle and serious"": he always goes to the same restaurant and orders the same dishes; his voice is not too loud, and his speaking speed is not too fast, he is gentle and courteous; he has few rumors, often sings about love, but has been in a loveless period for six years. The album 15 is not an exception to have several love songs, such as Zhang Yongcheng, which was inspired by the movie Ip Man 2 and describes Ip Man’s desire to go home to see his wife and children, and Qingsheng Strategy, which criticizes young people today who treat love as a game, and Errenyou, which tells a story of a third man who says no to a man. When it comes to the topic of love, Fang Daotong said that his ideal partner has not yet appeared, but he hopes to get married before the age of 35. Fang Datong says that he is a slow starter. ""I like to observe and listen, but I am also quite talkative among friends."" The reporter asked Fang Datong to tell a cold joke, saying that he was afraid that it would leave a bad impression on him. Then he still contributed two small jokes: ""When others ask me why I don't plan to get married and don't have a girlfriend, I say it's up to fate, and I'm too busy with work and recording."" He doesn't believe me, I said you should check my Weibo, because I need to mix, so there is no marriage. ""I have a hairdresser named Carl. When others ask where he is, I say he is in the parking lot."" ""(Carl and car - the pronunciation is similar)"""
收评：期市多头全线爆发油脂类集体冲高新浪财经讯周四，国内期市大宗商品全线上涨，油脂类品种集体走强，豆油、棕榈油、菜油盘中均创下一年新高，橡胶、棉花、有色金属也有不错涨幅，化工品，农产品大多小幅上涨。油脂类今日09连豆油持仓量增加，阻力位在10800、11000，近期或延续震荡上行态势，建议多单须持。美豆布林线有向上扩口的迹象，本周后半段美豆或试探14美元。昨日美国经济数据利好，导致美元大幅反弹，商品集体上涨，美豆也反弹至13.9美元。阿根廷本周末天气将恢复干旱，为美豆走势提供支撑。今晚美国农业部将公布出口销售报告，如销售数据利好，则美豆将继续看涨。因美豆与美其他作物比价关系仍处于均值以下，后市看涨，多单须持。同时，美所有农产品中油籽需求增长最快，且种植最为困难，支撑美豆价格。马棕榈油产量减少导致的库存下降将令豆类油脂受到较强支撑。今日国内油脂受美豆反弹影响创出新高，持仓量增加，后市将继续震荡走高，但短期或有震荡风险，建议投资者做多思路不变，逢低勇敢加仓。美国农业部1月12号将公布美作物供需报告，该报告或令豆类油脂上涨加速。[全文]橡胶技术来看，沪胶1105合约周四高开于前期高点实体之上，日内下探上一交易日收盘价格受到支撑回升，形态来看，均线呈多头排列，上涨趋势良好。指标来看，均线，MACD,KDJ均呈现金叉，出现较好入场点。但是目前沪胶处于前期高位，面临压力较大，追高需谨慎。整体而言，沪胶基本面依旧提供支撑，技术方面，均线呈现多头排列，上涨趋势线完好，后市沪胶突破前高指日可待。操作上建议前期多单继续持有。[全文]沪铜今日沪铜高位振荡，价格高开冲高后振荡回落，收盘仍上涨。受外盘探底回升提振，主力合约Cu1104以72010跳空高开，盘中一度72490，不过受国内股市疲软影响，铜价振荡回落，收盘于72020元，比上日收盘价涨740元。今日成交萎缩，成交19.1万手左右，总持仓减少8414手至338696手。今日铜价止跌反弹，价格重新站上5日均线之上，令短线调整暂时中止，不过，今日价格的反弹明显缺乏量和仓的配合，市场仍存在一定的畏高情绪，以逢高减仓为主。目前国内现货铜消费受到高价格抑制，未表现出节前备库的消费需求旺季，现货贴水保持在200-350元间，一定程度上压制了市场的做多人气，铜价将继续保持外强内弱格局，将被动跟随外盘涨势，预计近日沪铜将高位振荡为主，谨慎持有多单。[全文]玉米今日国内玉米市场冲高回落，尽管豆类市场大幅上涨，仍未能有效带动玉米期价，玉米现货供应平稳情况下，大部分资金转战其它波幅较大的品种。目前大连港内玉米平舱价2060-2070元/吨，水分14%，黑龙江新玉米到港价在2020元/吨上下，锦州港玉米平舱价在2070元/吨上下，市场成交依然偏淡。广东港内质量较好的新玉米报价在2160-2180元/吨，陈玉米报价2180-2200元/吨，港口质量较好的玉米走货速度较快，港口玉米库存23万吨左右。近期国内淀粉以及玉米油价格连续走低，下游需求不旺暂不支撑玉米价格上涨，深加工企业在利润下滑的情况下，收购价格有小幅回调的可能。另外，春节马上临近，农民在年前一般会有一个售粮高峰期，玉米的供应数量将会有所增加。不过前期玉米市场收购的主要力量是深加工以及中字头企业，普通贸易商一直没有竞争力，在深加工利润下滑及中字头企业受限的情况下，贸易商可能会抓紧这一售粮时机进行补库，这将限制玉米的下行空间。综合看，玉米市场仍将维持区间整理的走势，震荡区间2310-2360，投资者可进行波段操作，以区间两端为止损。[全文]燃料油周三公布的美国12月民间就业数据意外强于预期，提振市场人气。人力资源服务公司AutomaticDataProcessingInc。(ADP)与咨询机构MacroeconomicAdvisers公布的全美就业报告显示，12月份美国私营部门就业人数增加297,000人。经济学家此前预计，ADP将宣布12月份就业人数增加100,000人。美国能源资料协会(EIA)周三公布的周度库存报告显示，截至12月31日当周，美国原油库存减少416万桶至3.3527亿桶，预估为减少180万桶。周三，美国公布的私营部门就业人数好于预期，同时EIA公布的原油库存的下滑幅度也超出了市场预估，以上基本面因素对冲美元上涨的不利影响，提振原油价格走高，收复90美元关口；沪油方面，由于近期需求不振，价格一直在低位震荡，但4900附近有一定支撑，此处建立的多单可继续持有。[全文]早稻从近期现货市场的表现来看，北方以及华北地区粳稻收购价在稳步抬升，江南地区晚稻收购价相对平稳略有上调，目前早稻市场正处于清淡期，市场中贸易量不足。伴随春节消费高峰期的到来，市场稻米价格有望进一步出现上升。目前国际农产品市场整体上涨格局完好，谷物市场再度寻觅到新的题材支撑，料将使得CBOT农产品期价进一步上涨。国内谷物市场同样受到带动，早稻碍于政策压力，当前上涨势头依然较为缓慢。不过整体上仍将延续震荡走高形势。盘中表现可以看到，近期早稻市场需要周边氛围配合，在缺乏有效支撑的情况下，资金关注度相对不足，因此操作上建议多看少动，或者逢低少量布局阶段性多单。[全文]黄金隔夜美国公布的ISM非制造业指数及ADP就业人数好于预期，提振美元指数大涨，本周五即将公布美国12月非农就业报告，这可能对会黄金形成进一步的指引。回想上次12月3日公布美国11月的失业率高达9.8%远差于预期时，黄金当日应声大涨28美元，但近期的一系列数据均显示美国经济出现了一些回暖迹象，因此，明日公布的非农就业报告至关重要。短期来看，黄金可能会有大跌后技术上的一些反弹，但受制于美元指数的强势，预计反弹力度有限，上方压力位1390美元，下方支撑位1365美元。[全文]		正向	Summary: Commodity Futures Market Bullish, Vegetable Oil Prices Hit New Highs Sina Finance News - Thursday, China's domestic commodity futures market saw a full market rise, with vegetable oil varieties collectively strengthening, with rapeseed oil, palm oil, and rapeseed oil all hitting new highs in the middle of the day.

The resistance level is at 10800 and 11000. It is expected to continue the upward trend in the near term. It is recommended to hold long positions. There are signs of the Bollinger Bands of US soybeans expanding upwards, and US soybeans may test $14 this week. US economic data was positive yesterday, leading to a significant rebound in the US dollar and a rise in commodities, with soybeans also rebounding to $13.9. Argentina's weather will return to drought this weekend, providing support for the soybean outlook. Tonight, the USDA will release the export sales report. If the sales data is good, soybeans will continue to rise. Due to the ratio of soybeans to other US crops still being below the average, the market is expected to rise in the future, and long positions should be held. Meanwhile, the demand for oilseeds, the fastest-growing and most difficult-to-cultivate agricultural products in the US, supports the price of US soybeans. The decline in palm oil production will lead to a decrease in inventory, which will provide strong support for vegetable oils. Domestic oils were influenced by the rebound of US soybeans and hit a new high today. The open interest increased, and the market is expected to continue to rise, but there is a short-term risk of fluctuation. It is recommended that investors maintain the bullish strategy and courageously increase their positions at lower levels. On January 12, the USDA will release the US crop supply and demand report, which may accelerate the rise in vegetable oil prices. In terms of rubber technology, the Lu rubber 1105 contract opened above the previous high on Thursday, and the intraday price fell to the closing price of the previous trading day, which was supported and rose. From the chart pattern, the moving average is in a bullish arrangement, and the upward trend is good. Based on the indicators, the MA, MACD, and KDJ all show a golden cross, indicating a good entry point. But currently, rubber in Shanghai is at a relatively high level from the early stage, facing significant pressure, and it is advisable to be cautious when chasing high prices. Overall, the fundamentals of Shanghai rubber still provide support. From a technical perspective, the moving averages are in a bullish arrangement, the upward trend line is intact, and it is only a matter of time before Shanghai rubber breaks through the previous high. It is recommended to continue holding the long positions in the early stage. [Full text] Today, the Shanghai copper price fluctuated at a high level, opened and rose to a high, then fluctuated and fell back, but still closed up. Boosted by the bottom rebound of the foreign market, the main contract Cu1104 opened at 72010 with a gap up, and reached a high of 72490 during the session. However, affected by the weak performance of the domestic stock market, the copper price fluctuated and fell back, closing at 72020 yuan, up 740 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Today's turnover shrank, with about 191,000 contracts traded, and the total position decreased by 8,414 to 338,696 contracts. Today's copper price has stopped falling and rebounded, and the price has re-stationed above the 5-day moving average, temporarily halting the short-term adjustment. However, today's price rebound is clearly lacking in the cooperation of volume and position, and there is still a certain fear of high prices in the market. Reduce positions at high levels as the main strategy. Currently, domestic spot copper consumption is suppressed by high prices and does not show the pre-festival stockpiling demand in the peak season, with spot premiums maintained at 200-350 yuan, which to some extent suppresses the market's bullish sentiment. Copper prices will continue to maintain an external strong and internal weak pattern, passively following the upward trend of the foreign market. It is expected that in the near future, the Shanghai copper will mainly oscillate at a high level, and it is advisable to be cautious with long positions. [Full text] Corn prices in the domestic market of corn today fell after a rise, despite the significant rise in the bean market, it could not effectively drive the corn futures price. Under the stable supply of corn spot, most of the funds have switched to other varieties with larger fluctuations. Currently, the corn on the ground price in Dalian Port is 2060-2070 yuan per ton, with 14% moisture. The price of new corn from Heilongjiang Port is around 2020 yuan per ton. The corn on the ground price in Jinzhou Port is around 2070 yuan per ton. The market transactions are still relatively weak. New corn of better quality in the Guangdong port is quoted at 2160-2180 yuan per ton, while old corn is quoted at 2180-2200 yuan per ton. The port's corn of better quality is sold quickly, and the port's corn inventory is about 230,000 tons. Recently, the prices of starch and corn oil in China have been continuously falling. The downstream demand is not strong and does not support the rise in corn prices for the time being. Under the situation of declining profits, there is a possibility of a slight adjustment in the acquisition price of deep processing enterprises. In addition, the Spring Festival is approaching, and farmers usually have a peak period of selling grain before the Spring Festival, which will increase the supply of corn. However, the main force in the early corn market acquisition was deep processing and centrally-owned enterprises, and ordinary traders have never had competitiveness. Under the circumstances of declining profits of deep processing and restrictions on centrally-owned enterprises, traders may seize this opportunity to sell grain to replenish their inventory, which will limit the downward space of corn. Overall, the corn market is still expected to maintain a range consolidation pattern, with the oscillation range of 2310-2360. Investors can conduct band trading, with the range ends as stop-loss. Crude oil saw market sentiment lifted on Wednesday after the US private employment data for December came in unexpectedly strong. Human resources service company AutomaticDataProcessingInc. The ADP and the employment report released by the consulting firm Macroeconomic Advisers show that the number of private sector jobs in the US increased by 297,000 in December. Economists had expected ADP to announce an increase of 100,000 jobs in December. The weekly inventory report released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 4.16 million barrels to 335.27 million barrels for the week ending December 31, compared to the expected decrease of 1.8 million barrels. On Wednesday, the number of private sector jobs released by the United States was better than expected, and the decline in crude oil inventories released by EIA also exceeded market expectations. The above fundamental factors offset the negative impact of the dollar's rise, which boosted the price of crude oil and recovered the 90-dollar level. In terms of Shanghai oil, due to weak demand in recent days, the price has been oscillating at a low level, but there is some support around 4900, and long positions established here can be held. [Full text] Early rice, from the recent spot market performance, the acquisition price of japonica rice in the north and North China region is steadily rising, the acquisition price of late rice in the Jiangnan region is relatively stable with a slight increase, at present, the early rice market is in a period of lightness, the trading volume in the market is insufficient. With the arrival of the peak consumption period of the Spring Festival, the market price of rice is expected to rise further. The overall upward trend of the international agricultural product market is intact, and the grain market has found new topics to support, which is expected to further increase the CBOT agricultural product futures price. Domestic grain markets have also been boosted, but early rice, constrained by policy pressure, is still rising slowly. But overall, it will still maintain an upward trend with fluctuations. The performance during the session shows that the early rice market in the near term needs to be supported by the surrounding atmosphere. With insufficient attention from funds due to the lack of effective support, it is recommended to be more observant and less active in operations, or to lay out phased long positions at low levels. [Full text] The gold price was boosted by the better-than-expected ISM non-manufacturing index and ADP employment data released by the United States, which led to a sharp rise in the US dollar index. The US non-farm employment report for December will be released this Friday, which may provide further guidance for gold. Recalling that on December 3 last year, when the US unemployment rate in November was as high as 9.8%, far worse than expected, gold rose by 28 dollars on that day, but a series of recent data have shown that the US economy has shown some signs of recovery, so the non-farm employment report to be released tomorrow is crucial. In the short term, gold may have some technical rebounds after a sharp decline, but constrained by the strong US dollar index, the rebound is expected to be limited, with the upper pressure level at 1390 US dollars and the lower support level at 1365 US dollars.

燕西台西山果岭名门专家品鉴会(组图)(2)图为中国房地产及住宅研究会副会长顾云昌发言【范越】：首先感谢蔡总组织这个活动，燕西台我已经先来过两次，也看过这里的环境，对这片很熟悉，原来爬香山，去颐和园都是春游的时候小学的时候学校组织的，感觉也是独特的。我打高尔夫也是做了18年了，现在北京市打球的接近8万人，打球的人口，我和陈总也是好朋友，打球人口的增长和我们刚才顾总说的房地产的发展，我认为中国的经济不断的发展，确实给人们的生活水平提高带来了很快的机会。【范越】：就这块来说，在北京来说应该是独一无二的，虽然现在是9个洞的高尔夫球场，但是已经和社区形成了地产、别墅、高尔夫的结合，这个结合实际上刚才顾老已经说了，在国际上也就是这个硬件了，但是从软件上，高尔夫的文化来说，别墅、社区，包括生活的环境来讲，刚才我们聊天，陈总也说了，很多人喜欢爬山，我也认识很多的老同志喜欢爬山，大家认为剧烈的运动是好的运动，实际上高尔夫运动在三十岁、四十岁甚至更高的年龄可以推荐的运动，你可以从五岁运动到九十五岁，这个跨度非常大。【范越】：这么好的别墅两口人住应该还是很浪费的，一个好的社区应该是老人、孩子，最好是三代享受别墅的生活，实际上高尔夫为什么在中国理解不是很多，在国外很成熟的非常好的体育产业，特别是这个年代有老虎伍兹这么好的球员带动了这个产业。我去国外最大的体会是刷完油漆就可以去打球，普通的工人都可以去打球，这种社区如果一家生活在这里，孩子，甚至爷爷和孙子都可以享受这个生活，一起打球，这个在国外是很常见的，一家三口，我在美国打球的时候就遇到一个父亲和女儿、女婿，我和他们聊，他说我们家就在这里，出口就可以打球，这个社区球场还有一个好的东西，我们也提一个建议，像陈总这样的，就把物业费融进去了，打球就不花钱了。【范越】：我在洛杉矶考察了一个老年社区，这个还是高品质的球场，他们的球场比这个短，大概五千码，像年龄大的，短杆很短，像这样的社区在北京是没有的，因为抬头可以看到山，想爬山就可以爬山，想打球就可以打球，这个文化高尔夫渗透，因为高尔夫享受生活的概念在哪？最大的概念是调整自己的心态享受生活，而不是完全靠竞争，对抗，因为很多人在每天大量的脑力劳动以后需要放松，高尔夫最好的放松就是把自己的身体和心里做一个调整，年龄跨度，现在退下来很多的领导都开始享受高尔夫的快乐。【范越】：上个月我在日本体会到，现在有六七十个老年人打球然后晚上一起吃饭，享受这个生活，在中国还看不到这个场面，但是我觉得像陈总和我，再过二十年就是享受高尔夫的生活，享受这个优秀的社区、房产和高尔夫的结合，我觉得这是一个潮流，这是一个趋势，但是这个位置在北京已经没有了，如果说这个位置放在上海，就不得了了，因为北京还是和上海的房子便宜很多，我们从国际化来说，我也支持蔡总，我们去年就搞过这些论坛，特别是房山、西部这块，我们看到生活水平不可能下降，只是短期的时候遇到一些危机，就像人遇到一些身体上的不适等等，但是无论如何社区是往前走的，生活的水平不断的提高，这种前瞻性和预见性，作为投资者、房地产商也好，还是要站在一个高度去看房地产的发展。【范越】：我为什么讲高尔夫文化，我们在非典的时候也出过效果，在广东后一组的人打到前面的人前面了，结果很多人要打起来的，如果我想陈总和蔡总是邻居，一句话就不会造成更多的笑话，高尔夫在中国，因为有了好的社区的平台，大家在楼房里面互相都不认识，也是一种很尴尬的生活状态，在国外非常的友好，非常的友善，因为高尔夫的规格，礼节礼貌大家都知道，更高的境界是要为他人着想，所以我想从文化和精神上来讲，高尔夫还有很多的推广的东西，打球的孩子不容易学坏，打高尔夫有一个境界和追求的目标，很多精力放在打球上，老虎伍兹也免费给美国办了一个高尔夫学院，包括中国有NBA的篮球姚明，更多人喜欢NBA一样，燕西台虽然低调，但是也慢慢的看到了果岭名门，也是挺有特色的，所以我希望我们的社区越做越好，给北京的高尔夫文化和住宅文化提供好的平台和交流的机会。【主持人】：谢谢范总，刚才也是给你们提了一个意见，太低调也不好，我要是早一点知道这个项目，我在房子的时候就会考虑，以前还真是不知道，今天我也是第一次上项目现场来，您打球，知道球场的信息比我们快，我们还是想象从房产，要是两年前动的时候，两年前我们想，是什么价格，但是有球场的信息，当时就不是不知道这个信息的情况，就会失去一些置业者的机会。【主持人】：刚才您说的关于国外的发展趋势，像欧美的发达国家，他们的今天就是我们的未来，我们几年之后，甚至我们现在很多的方面都超越他们的，我前天中午跟一个做金融的，原来在政府部门工作的朋友谈一个事儿，我们整个过程当中就听他讲了，他现在鼓动身边的人一定要去找到好的，比如说教育、球场、医院这样好地段的房子去买，因为现在从整个大的经济形势来看，现在还是通缩，但是从全球的经济形势来看，所有的西方国家，包括我们国家的政府救市采取的举措来看，下半年肯定要进入通胀期，整个的物价指数，什么最保险，房产的投资从现在的市场，我们已经看出来了，大量的投资客已经开始进入到市场里面了，我们私下聊天他说一定要找好资源的物业拿着，未来一两年，通胀他预测今年年底会达到两位数，我觉得政府也是要综合考虑的。从改革开放到现在来说，经常是走两端的形势上的问题，以前毕竟我们缺乏很多的经验和手段，特别是房地产市场发展，我们和陈秘书长聊的时候，也一直担心，要救市，但是也不能过头，导致房价暴涨，这是政府担心的，但是整体的形势就在这里，不是中国在救市，欧美都在救市，美国大量的印钞票，对政府的消费刺激和带动作用还是有很高的影响，很多人预期在明年下半年一定会有很明显的显现，在这个时候，我想可能对于老百姓置业投资角度来说，理财都是需要密切关注的。图为北京房地产协会副秘书长陈志【主持人】：陈秘书长，您对北京的市场也很了解了，也请您谈谈对这个方面的看法。【陈志】：随便说说，因为顾老师在这里了，是高尔夫的前辈，我没有打过高尔夫，我踢足球，现在很多的朋友都被拉到高尔夫里面来了，足球是年轻人的运动。今天很高兴来到燕西台这个项目，一看环境非常好。刚才顾老师也说了，蔡总也说了房地产的一些情况，实际上说到一个信贷的问题。我昨天下午跟北京市银行协会交流，我们也聊到有关信贷方面的问题，从全国来说，一季度4.58万亿的信贷规模，觉得挺吓人的，全年的指标是5万亿，这才一季度，我们感觉到为了救市，一季度信贷的迅速膨胀，刚才像蔡总说的就有一个担心，这么大的资金下去了之后，会不会迅速的造成了大规模的通胀，甚至是不可控制的，我在跟银行协会的同志聊的时候得到一个信息，现在60%以上的规模还是在票据间，没有进入到实体经济当中，但是这么大量的钱，撰起来以后，怎么样把真正缺钱的，把资金用在实体经济当中，我们也在想，在今年的下半年，为银行企业，为我们的金融机构推出一个真正能够客观、评价我们房地产企业的信用的体系出来，这个我们昨天跟银行协会，谈的非常的愉快，也初步达成了一个意向，这个是我们下半年要做的一项事情，就是能够真正的把房地产企业和银行企业通过一种评价，让银行企业更多的认识到我们企业的价值。【陈志】：说到投资，刚才顾老师说了一个基本的概念，就是房子过五十年，六十年，他的生命周期就结束了，但是他的经济周期还没有结束，土地在不断的增值，作为投资角度来说，我想更多的是看到稀缺资源，特别稀缺地段的资源带来的投资，北京我们讲国际大都市的地位，政治、经济、文化的中心，特别是北京这样一个总部经济的汇聚的城市，这是一个非常特殊的，而且具有非常明显的窗口效应和示范效应，这个是我们全中国其他城市不可替代的资源，在这样的城市当中，我们还有这么好的一个项目，占有了这么大的稀缺资源，像我们讲的地铁上盖的，城市干线上的房产，只要地铁一通，价格就涨起来，从这个角度来看我们燕西台这个项目，从投资来说，我个人认为是没有问题的，应该是随着经济的发展，随着国际化、城市化的推进，这种资源会越来越少，作为稀缺资源，刚才范秘书长说了，包括教育、对人的性格的陶冶等等都有很多的作用，对经济也是一种拉动，所以我想这样的项目，不可能太多，因为他稀缺，不可能太多，我觉得应该是值得珍藏的产品。	顾云昌,范越,蔡,蔡总,陈,陈总,顾总,顾老,老虎伍兹,伍兹,姚明,范总,陈秘书长,陈志,顾老师,范秘书长	正向	Yanxi Tai Xishan Golf Ridge Expert Appreciation Meeting (Photo Album) (2) Gu Yunchang, vice president of China Real Estate and Residential Research Association, spoke at the meeting [Fan Yue]: First of all, thank you for organizing this activity, Mr. Cai. I have been to Yanxi Tai twice before and have seen the environment here. I am very familiar with this place. Originally, climbing Xiangshan and going to the Summer Palace were spring outings organized by my school when I was in elementary school, and I felt it was unique. I have been playing golf for 18 years, and now there are nearly 80,000 people playing golf in Beijing. The increase in the number of people playing golf and our friend Chen, General Manager, I think the development of China's economy has indeed brought a very fast opportunity to improve people's living standards. And the development of real estate that General Manager Gu just mentioned. [Fanyue]: As for this, it should be unique in Beijing. Although it is now a 9-hole golf course, it has already formed a combination of real estate, villas, and golf with the community. This combination, as Old Gu just said, is basically the hardware in the international market. However, from the software perspective, in terms of golf culture, villas, communities, and even living environment, as we were chatting, Mr. Chen also said that many people like mountain climbing, and I also know many old comrades who like mountain climbing. Everyone believes that intense exercise is a good exercise. In fact, golf can be recommended as a sport for people in their thirties, forties, or even higher. You can start from the age of five and continue to the age of ninety-five. The span is very large. [Fanyue] : Such a nice villa, two people living in it should still be very wasteful. A good community should be that the elderly, children, and preferably three generations enjoy the life of the villa. In fact, why is golf not understood very much in China, while it is a very mature and excellent sports industry abroad, especially in this era, Tiger Woods, such a good player, has promoted this industry. My biggest takeaway from going abroad is that after painting, you can go play, and ordinary workers can go play. If a family lives here, the children, even the grandfathers and grandsons can enjoy this life, play together, and this is very common in foreign countries. A family of three, when I was playing basketball in the United States, I met a father and daughter and son-in-law. I talked to them, and he said that our family lives here, and we can play basketball right outside the door. The community's basketball court has a good thing, and we also put forward a suggestion, like Mr. Chen, to integrate the property management fee, so that playing basketball doesn't cost any money. [Fanyue] : I visited a senior community in Los Angeles, and this is still a high-quality golf course. Their golf course is shorter than this, about 5,000 yards. For the elderly, the short clubs are very short. Such communities do not exist in Beijing because you can see the mountains when you look up, and you can climb mountains if you want to climb mountains, and you can play golf if you want to play golf. This culture of golf has permeated because where is the concept of enjoying life through golf? The biggest concept is to adjust your mindset to enjoy life, rather than relying entirely on competition and confrontation, because many people need to relax after a lot of mental labor every day. The best way to relax with golf is to adjust your body and mind, and now many retired leaders have started to enjoy the joy of golf. [Fanyue]: Last month, I experienced in Japan that there are now about 60 to 70 elderly people playing golf and having dinner together in the evening, enjoying this life. In China, we still can't see this scene, but I think that for Mr. Chen and me, in 20 years, we will be able to enjoy the life of golf, enjoy this excellent community, property, and the combination of golf. I think this is a trend, but this location is no longer available in Beijing. If this location were in Shanghai, it would be amazing, because Beijing is still much cheaper than Shanghai. From an international perspective, I also support Mr. Cai. We held these forums last year, especially in Fangshan and the western part. We saw that the living standards cannot be reduced, only encountering some crises in the short term, just like people encountering some physical discomfort, etc. But no matter what, the community is moving forward, the living standards are constantly improving, and this foresight and predictability, as investors and real estate developers, we still need to look at the development of real estate from a high point. [Fanyue]: Why do I talk about golf culture? We also had an effect during the SARS period. When the people in the back group of Guangdong hit the people in front, many people wanted to hit. If I think that Mr. Chen and Mr. Cai are neighbors, one sentence will not cause more jokes. In China, golf has a good community platform, and everyone does not know each other in the building, which is also a very awkward life state. It is very friendly and friendly abroad because of the specifications of golf, etiquette and politeness. The higher realm is to think for others. Therefore, I think that from the perspective of culture and spirit, there are still many things to promote about golf. It is not easy for children who play golf to go bad. There is a realm and pursuit goal in playing golf. Many people put more energy on playing golf. Tiger Woods also gave a free golf academy to the United States. Including China, there is a basketball Yao Ming like NBA. More people like NBA, although Yanxitai is low-key, but it has also gradually seen the green name, which is quite distinctive. So I hope that our community will be better and better, and provide a good platform and exchange opportunities for Beijing's golf culture and residential culture. [Host]: Thank you, Mr. Fan. I also gave you an opinion just now. It's not good to be too low-key. If I had known about this project earlier, I would have considered it when I was buying a house. I really didn't know before. Today is the first time I've come to the project site. You play ball and know the information about the golf course faster than us. If we had started two years ago, we would have thought about what the price would be. But with the information about the golf course, we wouldn't have lost the opportunity to buy a house. [Host]: What you just said about the development trends abroad, like the developed countries in Europe and America, their today is our future. In a few years, we will even surpass them in many aspects. Yesterday at noon, I talked to a friend who used to work in the government and is now in finance. During the whole process, we only listened to him talk. He is now encouraging people around him to buy good properties, such as houses in good locations for education, sports fields, and hospitals, because from the overall economic situation, it is still deflation now. But from the global economic situation and the measures taken by the government to save the market, it is certain that the second half of the year will enter the inflation period. The overall price index, what is the most secure, the investment in real estate from the current market, we have already seen that a large number of investors have already entered the market. In our private conversation, he said that we must hold good resources of property. In the next one or two years, he predicts that the inflation will reach double digits by the end of this year, and I think the government also needs to take a comprehensive consideration. From the reform and opening up to the present, it is often a problem of the situation at both ends. In the past, we lacked a lot of experience and means, especially in the development of the real estate market. When we talked to Secretary-General Chen, we were always worried that we needed to rescue the market, but we couldn't go too far, leading to a sharp rise in housing prices. This is what the government is worried about, but the overall situation is here. It's not just China that is rescuing the market, but Europe and America are also rescuing the market. The United States is printing a large amount of money, and the impact on government consumption stimulation and promotion is still very high. Many people expect that by the second half of next year, there will be a very obvious manifestation. At this time, I think that from the perspective of people's property investment, financial management is also something that needs to be closely watched. This is the vice secretary of the Beijing Real Estate Association, Chen Zhi [host]: Secretary Chen, you are very familiar with the market in Beijing, and I also hope that you can talk about your views on this aspect. [Chen Zhi]: Just talk casually, because Teacher Gu is here, he is a senior in golf, I have never played golf, I play football, now many of my friends have been pulled into golf, football is a sport for young people. Today I am very happy to come to Yanxitai project, and the environment is very good when I take a look. As Mr. Cai also mentioned just now, Mr. Gu also talked about the situation of real estate, which actually involves a credit issue. Yesterday afternoon, I communicated with the Beijing Banking Association, and we also talked about the credit issues. From the whole country, the credit scale of 4.58 trillion yuan in the first quarter is quite scary. The annual target is 5 trillion yuan. It is only the first quarter, and we feel that in order to save the market, the credit scale has rapidly expanded in the first quarter. As Mr. Cai said just now, we are worried that so much money will be poured in, and whether it will quickly cause large-scale inflation, even uncontrollable. When I talked to the comrades of the banking association, I got a piece of information. Now more than 60% of the scale is still in the bill market, and has not entered the real economy. But with so much money, how to use it in the real economy, how to use it in the real economy, we are thinking about it. In the second half of this year, we will launch a system that can truly objectively evaluate the credit of real estate enterprises for banks and financial institutions. This is what we talked about yesterday with the banking association, and we reached a preliminary agreement. This is something we will do in the second half of the year, which can truly evaluate real estate enterprises and banks through evaluation, and make banks more aware of the value of our enterprises. [Chen Zhi]: When it comes to investment, Gu teacher mentioned a basic concept just now, that is, after fifty or sixty years, the life cycle of the house has ended, but its economic cycle has not yet ended. The land is constantly increasing in value. From the perspective of investment, I think more attention should be paid to scarce resources, especially the resources of scarce locations. Beijing is an international metropolis, the center of politics, economy, and culture. In particular, this city where the headquarters economy converges is a very special one, and it has a very obvious window effect and demonstration effect. This is an irreplaceable resource in all the cities in China. In such a city, we still have such a good project, occupying such a large amount of scarce resources. As we said, the properties on the subway, the urban trunk line, as long as the subway is connected, the price will rise. From this perspective, we can see that the Yanxi Terrace project, from the perspective of investment, I personally think there is no problem. It should be that with the development of the economy, with the promotion of internationalization and urbanization, such resources will be less and less. As a scarce resource, Secretary-General Fan said just now, including education, the cultivation of people's character, etc., all have many effects, and it is also a kind of pull on the economy. So I think such a project, it is impossible to be too much, because it is scarce, it is impossible to be too much. I think it should be a product worth treasuring.
威廉姆斯学雷锋让出先发主帅：他是一个善良的人新浪体育讯　北京时间10月23日消息，据nj.com报道，周二篮网尼克斯赛前教练劳伦斯-弗兰克征询希恩-威廉姆斯意见，为他要不要先发，结果威廉姆斯居然严词拒绝了弗兰克的好意。当然弗兰克也没有就因此惊诧莫名用看外星人或者傻瓜一样的眼神去鄙视威廉姆斯，质疑他的进取心。篮网教练只是耸耸肩一笑而过，因为他太了解威廉姆斯。“他是非常非常真诚的让出了主力位置，”弗兰克说，“我不觉得这很诡异，他就是这样的人。希恩是一个团队至上的球员，他不是一个自私的家伙，他心地很善良的，他就是由衷的感到应该给布鲁克一个先发的机会。”不过弗兰克的辩解还是没法掩盖实质问题，威廉姆斯到底有没有心思去争夺主力中锋的位置？如果有，他为什么在这种需要更多出场时间刷更好数据证明自己的时候退缩？篮网主力中锋之争威廉姆斯已然落在洛佩斯和约什-布恩之后，此时还不奋起却学人做雷锋，到底是什么心态？威廉姆斯不是号称训练营头两周篮网No.1吗？“哥们，我知道自己能做什么，”威廉姆斯说，“球队的每个人也都知道我的能力，现在是训练营时间，教练只是去做他必须做的事情好让所有人都为新赛季做好准备。我能做的就是每天刻苦训练为新赛季机会的到来做好准备，懂了吗？”5场季前赛威廉姆斯只打了89分钟，而洛佩斯出场时间是139分钟，事实上威廉姆斯也没有充分展示自己的能力，他依然活力十足，但这却没能转化成实实在在的数据或者对比赛的影响力。“Ah，我确实有点在倒退，”威廉姆斯说，“我只是努力想回到正轨，在场上的时候尽量跑到正确的位置，去做正确的事情，进一步提高自己。我对自己的能力非常有信心，这只是季前赛而已，这些比赛不算数的，我只是想充分享受打球的乐趣，找到团队合作的感觉。全队都在努力变得更好，现在队里有不少伤兵，又有很多新球员加盟，现在只是培养团队默契的阶段，明白我的意思吗？”威廉姆斯的新赛季前景看上去愈发不够明朗，他没有得到多少打大前锋的机会，这影响了他的出场时间。而且威廉姆斯进攻一般、低位有待打磨。不过弗兰克担心的倒不是威廉姆斯的数据，而是他的表现还不够稳定。“希恩必须要做那种改变局势的人，活力四射的球员，在场上积极奔跑寻找轻松得分的机会，冲抢前场篮板保护禁区，”教练说道，“这些东西现在必须要成为他在联盟的标志、特征。”(加缪)	威廉姆斯,弗兰克,希恩-威廉姆斯,希恩,布鲁克,洛佩斯,约什-布恩,布恩,加缪	正向	"Williams gave up the starting position for Lei Feng: He is a kind person. Sina Sports News  On October 23, according to nj.com, before the game between the Nets and Knicks on Tuesday, coach Lawrence Frank asked Sean Williams whether he should start, and the result was that Williams actually firmly refused Frank's kindness. Frank did not look at Williams with a look of amazement as if he were an alien or a fool, questioning his ambition. The Nets coach just shrugged and smiled, because he knew Williams too well. ""He is extremely sincere in giving up the starting position,"" Frank said. ""I don't think it's weird. He is just like that."" Shien is a team player, he is not a selfish guy, he is very kind-hearted, and he really feels that it is appropriate to give Brook a starting opportunity. But Frank's defense still couldn't cover up the real problem, did Williams really have the heart to compete for the starting center position? If he did, why did he retreat at a time when he needed more playing time to prove himself with better data? Williams, who is the main center of the Nets, has already fallen behind Lopez and Josh Boone. What kind of mentality is it if he doesn't rise up and learn to be Lei Feng? Wasn't Williams supposed to be the Nets' No. 1 player in training camp for the first two weeks? ""Bro, I know what I can do,"" Williams said. ""Everyone on the team knows my ability, now it's training camp time, and the coach is just doing what he has to do to get everyone ready for the new season."" All I can do is work hard every day to prepare for the opportunity of the new season, do you understand? Williams played for only 89 minutes in the five pre-season matches, while Lopez played for 139 minutes. In fact, Williams did not fully demonstrate his ability. He was still full of energy, but this did not translate into tangible data or influence on the game. ""Oh, I am actually regressing a little,"" Williams said. ""I just try to get back on track and run to the right position on the court and do the right things to improve myself further."" I have a lot of confidence in my own abilities. This is just the pre-season, and these games don't count. I just want to fully enjoy the fun of playing and find the feeling of teamwork. The whole team is working hard to get better, and now there are a lot of injured players, and many new players have joined, it's just the stage of cultivating team chemistry, do you understand what I mean? Williams’ new season outlook is becoming increasingly unclear, as he has not received many opportunities to play as a power forward, which has affected his playing time. And Williams is average offensively and needs work in the low post. But what Frank was worried about was not Williams' data, but that his performance was not yet stable enough. ""Sean must be the kind of player who can change the course of a game, a dynamic player who runs the floor, looking for easy baskets, grabbing offensive rebounds to protect the paint,"" the coach said. ""These things must now be his signature and hallmark in the league."" (Camus)"

It will not be long before the dust settles, Peng Yang, an intern reporter of Financial Weekly, writes. 1+1<1 When will this situation occur? It often happens in Shanghai. The most typical case is that Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China, was put into use in 2000, which gave Shanghai an ""one city, two airports"" model similar to Incheon and Kimpo airports in South Korea's Seoul and Narita and Haneda airports in Tokyo, Japan. However, in the past 9 years, the market share of the two airports in the Yangtze River Delta has actually declined from 78% to 70%. And if the much-anticipated expansion of Hongqiao airport is completed by the end of 2009 and opens for trial operation in March 2010, the weak appeal of Shanghai airport’s listed assets at Pudong airport will be further diminished. So, will Shanghai Airport (600009.SH) inject it into the Shanghai airport before the expansion of Hongqiao Airport is completed, so as to achieve a full listing? It is believed that the dust will soon settle. ""Asset injection catalysts are approaching"" with market rumors intensifying recently. And the securities firms began to write intensive reports recommending Shanghai Airport, as Sunyuan said, ""Shanghai Airport has entered a period of rapid growth, and its long-term hub status has been strengthened. Phase II of Hongqiao will be put into operation in March next year, and at the same time, it will face business diversion and competition from peers. The catalyst for asset injection is approaching, and the rating has been upgraded to buy."" UBS Securities analyst Wei Qiang believes that the assets of Hongqiao Airport are likely to be injected into Shanghai Airport before March 2010. As early as the shareholders' meeting of Shanghai Airport on June 26, Yu Wuyan, the chairman of Shanghai Airport, made an urgent statement, ""The integration of Pudong Airport and Hongqiao Airport is inevitable, but there is no specific timetable at present."" The journalist contacted the office staff of Shanghai Airport, and the reply was that ""the company is currently studying specific integration plans, and there is no specific timetable."" The internal integration of the two airports is basically in place, and the key at present is to wait for the government to make a decision. According to a securities analyst close to Shanghai airport, the two airports had already prepared for the overall listing of the Shanghai airport group when they reached an agreement on asset swap in 2003. Shanghai Airport Group General Manager Jia Ruijun expressed the logic of the above analyst as early as after the expansion plan of Hongqiao Airport was approved in 2007. It seems that the management is strongly motivated to push for a full listing of the Shanghai airport. The expansion project of Phase II of Hongqiao has now completed the topping out of the terminal building structure and will be put into use in March 2010. The securities analysts believe that before the completion of Phase II of Hongqiao Airport before March next year, the assets of Hongqiao Airport are likely to be injected into Shanghai Airport, and will not violate the original commitment of asset injection and share reform. Shenwan's latest research report said that Shanghai Airport may take over Phase II of Hongqiao in two ways: one is to inject it into the listed company together with Hongqiao Phase I and other mature assets; the other is for the listed company to lease and use the assets of Phase II of Hongqiao, and to acquire them from the group in the future through financing. ""25% increase in 2009 performance"", domestic passenger traffic entering a period of rapid growth, international passenger traffic will resume positive growth, the successful reorganization of Air China and Shanghai Airlines, and the approach of the Expo, all undoubtedly injected a catalyst into the integration plan of Shanghai Airport. In 2008, the number of international and regional passengers at the two airports in Shanghai reached 164.8 million, which was clearly higher than that at the Capital Airport and Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou. In addition, the 2010 World Expo will bring an additional 6.2 million passengers to Shanghai, representing a 12% increase in passenger throughput. Currently, the revenue of Shanghai Airport mainly comes from aviation income, including landing and take-off fees, passenger transit service fees, and ground service income, and non-aviation income only accounts for 30%, and non-aviation development is not sufficient. With the implementation of the commercial development plan of Pudong Airport, there is a great potential for development in non-airport revenue areas in the future. According to Shenwan, the injection of mature assets such as Phase I of Hongqiao and cargo station will increase the 2009 performance by 25%, and the 2010 performance by 10%-15%. The Hongqiao Phase II, which may be operated through one-time injection or leasing, with a capital expenditure of 15 billion, may have a negative impact on the short-term performance of Shanghai Airport. Above, the UBS analyst believes that ""rational coordination by the management of the two major airports in Shanghai will be beneficial to small shareholders."""

经纪人确认中国前锋近期签葡超伤病令他彻底无缘备战新浪体育讯　如果没有随国奥队参加夏季的一系列热身赛事，效力于葡超升班马贝拉马尔的前锋王刚本来可以在家中度过一个愉快的暑假，而现在，他也应该早已回到葡萄牙，随队在外地进行一系列的备战以及比赛。然而一心穿上国字号球衣的王刚却在夏天的比赛中遭遇了伤病的意外，这次伤病不仅让他基本无缘贝拉马尔赛季前的备战训练营，甚至葡萄牙媒体称，这将有可能影响到他最终与贝拉马尔签订新赛季的工作合同。尽管在接受了核磁共振的检查后王刚的伤势并无大碍，但在回到葡萄牙的前几天，心情不太好的王刚仍然选择了独处。20日，是之前王刚说要回到葡萄牙阿威罗的日子。但根据他的经纪人透露，他并未直接与贝拉马尔汇合，而是将在阿威罗独自进行恢复，这也意味着，王刚很可能将错过葡超赛季前的整个备战期。不过经纪人稍后给出了一个让人欣慰一些的消息，那就是王刚的伤情没有葡萄牙媒体说的这么严重，并且不会影响到他新赛季征战葡超。他透露，在贝拉马尔结束夏训营返回阿威罗后，王刚将与球队正式签订新赛季的工作合同。另外针对于记者所关心的“王刚11月是否会回国参加亚运会”的问题，经纪人也给出了解释：“现在王刚的身体情况还没法最后的确定，还要看他伤势恢复的情况，但如果一切顺利的话，他仍然将参加在广州举行的亚运会足球赛。”(孟晓雨)	王刚,孟晓雨	正向	The agent confirmed that Wang Gang, the Chinese forward who plays for Belamar, a newly promoted team in the Portuguese Super League, was injured and could not participate in the preparation and matches. If he did not participate in a series of warm-up matches with the national team in the summer, he could have spent a pleasant summer vacation at home. Now, he should have returned to Portugal and joined the team for a series of preparations and matches in another place. However, Wang Gang, who was determined to wear the national team jersey, suffered an injury in the summer match, which not only made him basically unable to participate in the pre-season training camp of Belenam, but also Portuguese media said that this might affect his final signing of the new season's work contract with Belenam. Although Wang Gang's injuries were not serious after the MRI check, he still chose to be alone in the days before returning to Portugal, as his mood was not good. On the 20th, it was the day Wang Gang said he would return to Aveiro, Portugal. But according to his agent, he did not join Belenam directly, but will recover alone in Aveiro, which means that Wang Gang is likely to miss the entire pre-season preparation for the Portuguese Super League. However, the agent later gave a somewhat reassuring message, that Wang Gang's injury was not as serious as the Portuguese media reported, and would not affect his participation in the new season of the Primeira Liga. He revealed that Wang Gang will sign a new season's work contract with the team after returning to Aveiro from Bella Maral's summer camp. As for Wang Gang’s participation in the Asian Games in Guangzhou in November, which the reporters were concerned about, the agent also gave an explanation: “Wang Gang’s physical condition is still not certain at present, and it still depends on his recovery from the injury. But if everything goes well, he will still participate in the football match of the Asian Games in Guangzhou.” (Xiaoyu Meng)
上海证券：11月份PPI数据点评证券通PPI涨幅迅速回落超出市场预期11月份，工业品出厂价格指数同比增幅仅为2.0%，大大超出市场预期。生产资料出厂价格指数同比增幅继续快速回落，而生活资料出厂价格回落速度继续小于生产资料价格。CPI的回落幅度会继续小于PPI的回落幅度。原材料价格涨幅伴随国际大宗商品价格回落国内原材料、燃料、动力价格与国际大宗商品价格走势具有较强的趋同性，由于“订单效应”的滞后影响，国内的价格一般要滞后国际价格2-3个月。在国际市场大宗商品价格未现回暖迹象的情况下，后期国内的原材料价格指数还会延续下降的态势。关注PPI关注工业企业收入对于工业企业来讲，原材料价格涨幅回落应该是好消息，因为企业的生产成本会逐渐下降。但与此同时，作为收入来源的工业品出厂价格涨幅的快速下滑则导致工业企业的经营状况前景堪忧。PPI是工业企业收入的Granger原因，即工业品出厂价格的变化是工业企业收入变化的原因。在关注原材料下降的同时，我们更要关注PPI下降带给工业企业的不利影响。下一交易日大盘走势判断您目前的仓位		正向	"Shanghai Stock Exchange: PPI data commentary in November, the PPI increase has dropped sharply, exceeding market expectations in November, the year-on-year growth of the industrial product factory price index is only 2.0%, far exceeding market expectations. The year-on-year growth rate of the production material factory price index continued to fall rapidly, while the decline rate of the consumer goods factory price index was still lower than that of the production materials price. The decline in CPI will continue to be less than that in PPI. Raw material prices have risen in tandem with the decline in international commodity prices. Domestic raw materials, fuels, and power prices have a strong tendency to follow international commodity prices. Due to the lagging effect of ""order effects"", domestic prices are generally 2-3 months behind international prices. With no signs of a rebound in international commodity prices, the raw material price index in the domestic market will continue to decline in the future. Focus on PPI Paying attention to the industrial enterprise income for industrial enterprises, the decline in raw material price increases should be good news, because the production cost of enterprises will gradually decrease. But at the same time, the rapid decline in the increase of industrial product出厂价格 as a source of income has cast doubt on the operating conditions of industrial enterprises. PPI is a Granger cause of industrial enterprise revenue, that is, changes in the prices of industrial products are the cause of changes in industrial enterprise revenue.

India, which borders China, is located in the South Asian subcontinent, with an area of about 2.98 million square kilometers and a population of 1.166 billion. The Indian economy is based on traditional farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, modern industry, and other supporting industries. In India, the communication market has great potential, and the openness of the market has also attracted many operators to participate, making competition increasingly fierce. Aircel is a controlling subsidiary of Maxis Group, a new mobile operator in Southeast Asia, and 74% of its shares are owned by Maxis. Currently, Aircel has 19.6 million users in India. As one of the leading mobile network service providers in India, Aircel has already covered 10 states in India. Currently, it plans to cover the whole of India.

On October 31, 2009, the network construction had achieved 3,203 sites installed, 3,163 sites activated, and 1,611 sites accepted. The full Turnkey GSM project of Aircel in India, with an average of 400 stations built quickly each month, including the quick delivery of 35% of the Turnkey sites, a series of outstanding performance came from ZTE's good management of Chinese and local human resources, effective use of regional advantages, full cross-cultural communication and exchange, as well as the training and technology transfer of outsourcing partners.
国米名将质疑里皮弃召米兰锋霸意大利一漏洞恐难挽回新浪体育讯　意大利成为了世界杯32强当中倒数第三个公布名单的国家，国家队23人名单公布，最终，西里古、科苏、卡萨尼、博列洛、G-罗西成为了最后的落选者。虽然此前的格罗索的落选引起了不小的震动，但起码争议并不是很大，但这次的五个落选者，却引来了不少的质疑。被质疑最多的是博列洛的落选，尽管名宿巴齐解释说：“里皮是想要一个和吉拉迪诺特点类似的替补，因此选择了帕奇尼，放弃了博列洛。”但前国际米兰球星贝卡罗西还是感到可惜：“我知道里皮倾向于吉拉迪诺，但我还是觉得，博列洛拥有一个优秀的赛季。”其实问题倒不是在于里皮的选择究竟是帕奇尼还是博列洛，而是博列洛和朱塞佩-罗西的确是两位有实力的球员，而他俩都落选之后，首先，意大利失去了一种强力中锋的打法，其次，迪纳塔莱唯一的替补没了。在前锋线上，意大利只有吉拉迪诺、帕奇尼、亚昆塔、迪纳塔莱、夸利亚雷拉五个人，的确有些过于单薄。而这其中，意大利媒体此前都预测锋线的落选者肯定会有夸利亚雷拉，而罗西和博列洛将“竞争”一个名额，结果里皮的选择令所有人感到意外。从里皮的选择来看，他还是希望以4-3-3主打，相比于罗西，夸利亚雷拉是一个真正的边锋，但里皮的首选一定还是亚昆塔和迪纳塔莱，一旦两人当中有一人出现伤停，里皮真的敢用状态平平的夸利亚雷拉么？如果这样，即便里皮人为排除了卡萨诺，但为何不选入巴洛特利呢？科苏的落选早在媒体的预料之中，但还是一件令人纠结的事情，一旦意大利需要变阵添一个前腰，目前唯一的人选就只剩下了卡莫拉内西，但相比于赛季助攻12球，并有一脚远射绝活的科苏，已经长起了小肚腩的卡莫拉内西的确是状态太差了，在经验和状态之间选择了前者，不知道里皮做出的是否是正确的选择。在后卫线上，卡萨尼的落选同样有一些疑问。目前，里皮仅拥有7名后卫，其中包括卡纳瓦罗、基耶利尼、博努奇、博凯蒂四名中后卫，马乔、克里西托、赞布罗塔三名边后卫，但三名边后卫中，马乔和克里西托在俱乐部分别打的是3-5-2和3-4-3阵型中的边卫，与4-4-2当中的边卫大相径庭，赞布罗塔的定位还是替补，就算里皮将基耶利尼移到了左路，但基耶利尼在俱乐部打左后卫时还是在卡佩罗执教尤文时代，而他打左后卫的水平比起其后来打中后卫差距很大，这样做，既削弱了基耶利尼，又削弱了意大利的中卫位置。而缺少一个真正的边后卫的问题，很可能将成为意大利在世界杯上一个无可挽回的漏洞。(沈飞)	里皮,科苏,卡萨尼,博列洛,G-罗西,罗西,巴齐,吉拉迪诺,帕奇尼,贝卡罗西,朱塞佩-罗西,迪纳塔莱,亚昆塔,夸利亚雷拉,卡萨诺,巴洛特利,卡莫拉内西,卡纳瓦罗,基耶利尼,博努奇,博凯蒂,马乔,克里西托,赞布罗塔,卡佩罗,尤文,沈飞	正向	"A former Inter star questioned Li Tie's decision to exclude Milan striker, and Italy's vulnerability may be difficult to recover. Sina Sports News, among the 32 countries participating in the World Cup, Italy was the third to announce the list, the national team of 23 people, in the end, Xisigou, Kousu, Casani, Bolelo, G-Rossi became the last to be excluded. Although the previous Grosseto's elimination caused quite a stir, at least the controversy was not very big, but this time the five eliminated candidates have attracted a lot of doubts. The most questioned omission was that of Borrelli, despite the explanation of the veteran Baggio, who said that ""Terry Pratchett wanted a substitute with similar characteristics to Gialiddo, so he chose Paolini and left Borrelli out."" But former Inter Milan star Baccaroschi still feels sorry: ""I know that Prandelli prefers Gialiddino, but I still think that Borrelli had a great season."" The problem is not whether Prandelli chose Pachini or Borrelli, but that Borrelli and Giuseppe Rossi are both talented players. After both of them were left out, first, Italy lost a powerful striker, and second, D'Inazio no longer had a substitute. In the attack, Italy only has Gialiddino, Pachini, Aquilanta, Dinatale, and Quagliarella, which is indeed a little thin. And among them, the Italian media had previously predicted that the striker who would be left out would definitely be Quagliarella, and Rossi and Boleslo would ""compete"" for a spot, but Liapi's choice surprised everyone. From Liapi's choice, he still hopes to play 4-3-3 as the main, compared with Rossi, Quagliarella is a true winger, but Liapi's first choice must still be Aquilani and Dinatale, will Liapi really dare to use Quagliarella, who is in poor form, if one of the two is injured? If so, why did Liapi not select Balotelli, even if he deliberately excluded Cassano? Kossu's defeat was expected by the media, but it was still a difficult matter. Once Italy needed to add a central midfielder, the only choice was Camoranesi. However, compared to Kossu, who scored 12 goals and had a long-range shot skill in the current season, Camoranesi, who had grown a little potbelly, was indeed too poor in form. Between experience and form, he chose the former. I wonder if Li Pei made the right choice. There are also some doubts about Cassani's absence from the back line. Currently, Li Pi only has 7 defenders, including four center-backs, Cannavaro, Chiellini, Bonucci, and Bocchetti, and three wing-backs, Majo, Cristit, and Zambrotta. However, among the three wing-backs, Majo and Cristit play as wing-backs in the 3-5-2 and 3-4-3 formations in their respective clubs, which is quite different from the wing-backs in the 4-4-2 formation. Zambrotta's position is still a substitute. Even if Li Pi moves Chiellini to the left, Chiellini still played as a left-back in the era when Capello coached Juventus, and his level as a left-back is much worse than that of a center-back. In this way, it not only weakens Chiellini, but also weakens the position of Italian center-backs. And the lack of a genuine full-back is likely to become an irreparable hole in Italy’s World Cup campaign. (Shen Fei)"
50%唐正东究竟什么状态？每两分钟就能进1球抢1板新浪体育讯　北京时间10月29日消息，中国男篮在宁波北仑迎战亚运前的另一个热身对手美国明星队，最终中国队以92比64战胜了对手，取得了本次系列热身赛的首场胜利。唐正东本场比赛发挥出色，在出场13分钟的时间里就拿下了7分7个篮板。第三节比赛还有5分钟，朱芳雨在上线吸引防守之后交给了唐正东。此时，唐正东的身边并没有防守人，他犹豫了一下并没有马上进攻，美国明星队的防守球员很快合围过来，形成了三人包夹之势，唐正东转身强攻造成了对手的犯规。这样的一次进攻充分展现了唐正东现在的状态，在因伤离开赛场了一段时间之后，唐正东在场上的感觉还没有达到最佳状态，他在比赛中的攻防选择中还有一些犹豫，速度还有些慢。不过在这支美国明星队面前，唐正东的身高和体重仍然占据着绝对的优势，即使是三人合围，对手也只能用犯规来阻挡他的进攻。身高和体重上的优势，唐正东还会延续到亚洲赛场，只不过他需要赶快找到比赛场上的感觉，把脚步移动的速度提上来才行。虽然唐正东的状态并没有达到最佳，但有一点是可以肯定的，现在的大唐很努力。第三节还有3分42秒，唐正东在一次和对方争抢篮板当中倒地救球，要知道，这已经是他在本场比赛的第二次倒地救球了，这样的场面，即使是在唐正东状态稳稳的时候也没有看到，更何况现在他的膝伤还没有完全痊愈。至少从这点可以看出唐正东的努力态度。持球背身进攻，抢到前场篮板之后的二次进攻，妙传对手的助攻，尽管出场时间并不算太多，但唐正东已经在这场比赛中充分展现出了他在内线的威慑力。如果拿现在的表现和巅峰时的唐正东相比，只能说他刚刚恢复了50%，就算这样，他的效率平均下来也是不到两分钟就能拿下1分1个篮板了。央视的著名评论员苏群谈到唐正东的表现时说到：“在离开了赛场这么久之后，唐正东有99%的可能都会去打亚运会，特别是在苏伟因伤不能打的时候，这对他来说是个非常不错的表现机会。”唐正东上一次穿着国家队的战袍征战在国际赛场上，还要追溯到2006年的多哈亚运会。可那次经历对于唐正东来说却是不堪回首的。当时国家队的主帅还是脾气有些固执的尤纳斯，他只给了唐正东一场的表现机会，便彻底将大唐按在了板凳上。从那开始，唐正东就彻底跌入了低谷，他在联赛中不断遭遇伤病的困扰，国家队的集训更总是与他擦肩而过。现在，从伤病中走出来的唐正东终于有机会在亚运赛场上证明自己了，姚明和易建联因为征战NBA不能出战，苏伟又因伤不能打。对于唐正东来说，这也许是他职业生涯中最重要的一个转折点了。(乳娃娃)	唐正东,朱芳雨,苏群,苏伟,尤纳斯,姚明,易建联	正向	"What is the condition of 50% Tang Zhengdong? Scoring and grabbing a rebound every two minutes, Sina Sports News, on October 29, Beijing time, the Chinese men's national team defeated the American star team, the opponent, in Ningbo Beilun, and won the first victory in this series of warm-up matches. Tang Zhengdong performed excellently in this game, scoring 7 points and grabbing 7 rebounds in just 13 minutes of play. With 5 minutes left in the third quarter, ZHU Fangyu passed to TANG Zhengdong after drawing the defense to the top of the key. There was no defender by Tang Zhengdong at the moment. He hesitated for a moment and did not attack immediately. The American star team's defenders quickly surrounded him, forming a three-man encirclement, and Tang Zhengdong turned and attacked strongly, causing the opponent to commit a foul. This offensive fully demonstrated Tang Zhengdong's current condition. After being away from the court for a period of time due to injury, Tang Zhengdong's feeling on the court has not yet reached the best state, and there is still some hesitation in his offensive and defensive choices in the game, and his speed is still a little slow. But against this American all-star team, Tang Zhengdong still had an absolute advantage in height and weight, and even when three people surrounded him, the opponent could only use fouls to block his attack. Height and weight advantages will still be maintained by Tang Zhengdong in the Asian arena, but he needs to quickly find the feel of the game and speed up his footwork. Although Tang Zhengdong's condition was not at its best, it is certain that the current Tang Dynasty is working hard. With 3:42 left in the third quarter, Tang Zhengdong fell to the ground to save the ball during a rebound battle with the other team. It should be known that this was his second time falling to the ground to save the ball in this game. Such a scene has never been seen even when Tang Zhengdong was in good condition. How could it be now that his knee injury had not yet fully recovered. At least from this, we can see Tang Zhengdong's attitude of effort. With the ball in hand, he went to the backcourt to attack. After grabbing the front court rebound, he launched a second attack. He passed the ball to his teammate, who made a good assist. Although his playing time was not too much, Tang Zhengdong had fully demonstrated his power in the frontcourt in this game. Compared with his peak performance, he can only be said to have recovered 50%. Even so, his efficiency is still less than one point and one rebound every two minutes on average. Su Qun, a famous commentator of CCTV, said about Tang Zhengdong's performance: ""After being away from the court for such a long time, Tang Zhengdong has a 99% chance of participating in the Asian Games, especially when Su Wei cannot participate in the Asian Games due to injury, which is a very good opportunity for him."" The last time Tang Zhengdong wore the national team's uniform to compete on the international stage was back in the 2006 Doha Asian Games. But that experience was one that Tang Zhengdong would rather not recall. At that time, the national team coach was the stubborn Yujun, who only gave Tang Zhengdong one chance to play and then completely sat him on the bench. Since then, Tang Zhengdong has completely fallen into a low point, and he has been plagued by injuries in the league. He always misses the national team training. Now, after recovering from injury, Tang Zhengdong finally has the opportunity to prove himself on the Asian Games stage, while Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian are unable to participate due to their NBA commitments, and Su Wei is also unable to play due to injury. This might be a turning point in Zhang Zhen Dong's career. (Baby doll)"

国奥惨败后集体拒绝采访教练组紧锁房门未进晚餐新浪体育讯　0-3，这是国奥队与韩国队比赛之前没有人想到的结果。就在三天之前，这支韩国球队还以1-4的大比分负于中国香港队。面对这样的结局，中国国奥队在赛后集体失声，晚餐时分教练组更是没有一个人下楼用餐。本场比赛吸引了很多国内的记者前来采访，因为大家都是冲着中国足球能够打破20年逢韩不胜的纪录来的。可是，最终大家又一次见证了中国足球的耻辱。比赛结束之后，主教练刘春明在发布会耐心地接受大家的采访。由于提问的记者很多，发布会结束之后，当记者们匆匆赶到混合采访区的时候，发现这里空无一人。正以为国奥已经走光的时候，志愿者告诉大家，国奥队还没有出来。直到发布会结束将近10分钟之后，国奥队的一行人才默默从休息室的通道内走出来。打头阵的是于洋等一些没有上场的替补，随着当主力队员走出来之后，面对等候在混采的记者们，大家都脚步匆匆地离开，即使偶尔有一两个人被拉住，也是面露难色地近乎用哀求的声音说到：哥，别采了，没啥好说的，而且也不让说。到底是谁不让说，还是借口。随后等候在混区的记者又拉住了两个队员，得到的回答一致的：队里真不让说。事实上就在比赛之前的踩场训练之时，国奥队就已经拒绝了一次媒体采访。即使是面对中央电视台的镜头，国奥队也以代表团有统一规定，只能在新闻发布会与混合采访区接受采访为由拒绝了赛前采访。可是，赛后在混合区，竟然冒出了“不让接受采访”的声音，队员们撇下这一句话之后，就匆匆跑上了大巴车，最后从休息室走出来的是领队李晓光，当记者们询问是不是不让接受采访之时，李晓光一脸疑惑：不能啊，没有啊。随后，有4家媒体再次来到了国奥队下榻的酒店。国奥队吃饭的时候是晚上10点30分，到了用餐的时候，队员们依旧一副失落的表情走进了餐厅。即使面对相熟的记者，也只是偶尔站住低声聊上几句。无奈之下，记者们只能来到楼上向询问个究竟。领队李晓光在了解了整个经过之后进行了解释：“之前代表团确实有规定，只能在发布会和混合采访区接受采访，所以赛前按照规定没有接受采访。但今天绝对没有说不让队员说话，应该是队员们心情不好。毕竟输了球，又是大比分，孩子们都很难过，这是可以理解的。但下一场保证会安排球员配合采访，即使是再输球、即使是队员们心情不好，自己也会把他们从大巴车上叫下来。”队员们没有心情接受采访，教练组则连吃饭的心情都没有了。直到队员们用过晚餐之后，几位教练也都没有走出房门，看来这个夜晚对于国奥来说，注定又是一个苦涩的难眠之夜。(宋词发自香港)	刘春明,于洋,李晓光	负向	"After the惨败, the national team collectively refused to interview the coaching team, locked the door and did not enter the dinner. Sina Sports News 0-3, this is the result of the national team and the Korean team before the match, no one expected. Three days ago, this Korean team lost to Hong Kong by a score of 1-4. In the face of such an outcome, the Chinese Olympic team collectively fell silent after the game, and the coaching staff did not go downstairs for dinner. Many domestic reporters came to interview this game because everyone was looking forward to the record of Chinese football breaking the 20 years of not winning against South Korea. But in the end, everyone witnessed the shame of Chinese football once again. After the match, the head coach Liu Chunming patiently received the interview from everyone at the press conference. Because there were so many reporters asking questions, when the reporters rushed to the mixed interview area after the press conference ended, they found that there was no one there. Just as we thought that Guo Ao had already left, the volunteers told us that the Guo Ao team had not yet come out. It was not until nearly ten minutes after the press conference ended that the members of the Olympic team came out of the passage of the rest room in silence. The substitutes, such as Yu Yang, who did not participate in the game, led the way. After the main players walked out, they hurriedly left the waiting reporters at the mixed zone. Even if one or two of them were pulled back, they pleaded with a sad voice: Brother, don't interview, there's nothing to say, and they are not allowed to say anything. Who is it that doesn't want to say, or is it an excuse? The reporters waiting in the mixed zone then held back two players, who gave a consistent answer: the team really doesn't allow them to talk. In fact, the Olympic team had already refused a media interview during the field training session right before the match. Even in front of the CCTV lens, the Olympic team refused the pre-game interview on the grounds that the delegation had a unified regulation and could only be interviewed in the press conference and the mixed zone. But after the game, in the mixed zone, there was even a voice that did not want to be interviewed. After the players said this, they rushed to the bus, and in the end, the team leader Li Xiaoguang came out of the rest room. When the reporters asked if they were not allowed to be interviewed, Li Xiaoguang was puzzled: No, there was no such thing. Then, four more media outlets came to the hotel where the Olympic team was staying. The Under-23 team had dinner at 10:30 p.m., and when it was time to eat, the players still walked into the dining hall with a disappointed expression. He would only stop occasionally to chat in a low voice with familiar journalists. In the end, the reporters could only go upstairs to ask what was going on. After team leader Li Xiaoguang understood the whole process, he explained: ""The delegation did have a rule before, which was that they could only be interviewed at the press conference and the mixed interview area, so they did not accept interviews before the competition according to the rule."" But today it was definitely not that the players were not allowed to speak; it was that the players were in a bad mood. After all, they lost the game and by a large margin, so it’s understandable that the children are sad. But the next one will definitely arrange for the players to cooperate with the interview, even if they lose again, and even if the players are in a bad mood, I will still call them down from the bus. The players had no mood for an interview, and the coaching staff had no mood for eating. The coaches did not leave their rooms until the players had finished their dinner, and it seemed that this night would be another sleepless one for the Olympic team.

荷兰一名遭绑人质在阿富汗获释新华网喀布尔12月3日电(记者闫亮)阿富汗非政府机构“阿富汗普林斯”负责人3日向新华社记者证实，该机构一名被绑架的荷兰籍雇员和他的阿富汗籍司机2日晚些时候获释。“阿富汗普林斯”负责人阿曼·乌丁说，10月25日，该机构一名荷兰籍男雇员在从昆都士省前往塔哈尔省途中遭到绑架，他于本月2日晚些时候获释。乌丁说，目前，这位名为彼得的荷兰男子身体状况正常，不久将返回荷兰。获释的阿富汗籍司机也已回到家人身边。但尚不清楚荷兰方面是否交付赎金使人质获救。目前尚没有任何组织和个人宣称制造了这起绑架事件。“阿富汗普林斯”主要在阿富汗北部塔哈尔省为残疾儿童提供帮助。	闫亮,阿曼·乌丁,乌丁,彼得	正向	"A Dutch hostage in Afghanistan was released.

家电网购渠道市场发展猛前景看好2011年“五一”过后，库巴网副总裁彭亮有点“上火”，这股火来自于“搬家”。2010年，库巴网的工作人员只有200多人，现在已经超过800人。“以前的办公室挤不下这么多人，我们只好一次次搬家。”彭亮说，“工作人员还在继续扩充，目前最迫切的问题是尽快租房子，否则办公室又要不够用了。”不久前，彭亮又租下瑞达大厦半层写字楼，这样，库巴网北京的办公面积在3000多平方米基础上新增了1000多平方米，在全国的办公面积已经超过1万平方米。5个月时间里，工作人员数量增长3倍。对此，彭亮不无自豪地告诉《电器》记者，工作人员数量的增长与网站销售额的增长呈正比。“2010年，库巴网销售额为5亿元，2011年将为15亿~20亿元。仅今年‘五一’促销期间，库巴网就实现了超过1亿元的销售额。”市场发展迅猛仅几天时间就实现1亿元的销售规模，这在去年对于多数家电网购平台来说都是不敢想象的。2010年，在家电网购渠道中，全年销售额超过1亿元的网站屈指可数。奥维咨询(AVC)数据表明，2010年，中国家电网购规模为80亿元，占家电市场整体规模的比重不到2%。在80亿元的销售规模中，京东商城和苏宁易购分别超过20亿元，居前两位，库巴网达到5亿元，新七天电器网为5.5亿元，淘宝电器城、新蛋网均超过1亿元。业内人士表示，与2010年相比，2011年各传统渠道纷纷发力网络平台，家电网购市场会呈现爆发式增长。2011年2月23日，苏宁电器发布了以电子商务发展为重点的《2011年整体发展规划》，宣布成立独立运作的公司——苏宁易购，与实体连锁零售业务平行，力争实现销售额翻两番、达到80亿元的目标，并在不久的将来实现100亿元的销售收入。4月，改版后的国美(微博)网上商城(www.gome.com.cn)正式上线。国美规划，未来2~3年网上商城将占其销售额的10%以上，并将占据中国家电网购市场容量的15%以上。新七天电器网总裁左英杰认为，2011年，京东商城、淘宝电器城都有望实现40亿元的家电销售规模，国美网上商城和库巴网合计达到40亿元，新七天实现5亿~8亿元。如果苏宁能实现100亿元销售规模，2011年中国家电网购销售规模将比2010年增长近2倍。奥维咨询(AVC)预测，家电网购未来几年将保持高速增长，预计2015年会突破千亿元规模，占家电市场总体规模的比重达14%，成为家电市场的第三大渠道业态。目前中国家电网络渠道的竞争主体已形成三大类平台，即以京东商城和淘宝电器城为代表的第三方B2C家电网络平台、以国美和苏宁为代表的传统连锁渠道网络平台、以各品牌商为代表的企业自建网络平台。从销售规模来看，京东商城、国美电器(微博)(包括国美网上商城、库巴网)、苏宁易购、淘宝电器城、新七天电器网已经树立行业地位。业内人士称，第三方B2C家电网络平台和传统连锁渠道网络平台是网络渠道发展的主力军，企业自建网站因产品单一、没有价格优势，与其他两个渠道相比销售规模较小。2011年，家电企业自建网络平台的销售业绩也在增长，但是与其他两大平台相比增幅较小。作为企业自建网站，从2010年5月到现在，海信网上商城已经上线整整1年。海信科龙(微博)电子商务部总经理禚洪斋说：“到目前为止，海信网上商城销量已经超过上线初期公司规定的任务量，但是中国家电网购市场发展如此迅速，我们销售规模的增长情况并未达到心理预期。”与此同时，禚洪斋表示，虽然海信有自建的网上商城，但是七成多的网上销售额仍来自第三方B2C家电网购平台。一些企业正在着手准备自建网上商城。帅康集团常务副总裁刘春华告诉《电器》记者，网络渠道是家电销售未来的发展方向。两年前，帅康组建了网络营销部，这是国内厨电企业的第一个网络营销部门。“帅康目前在第三方B2C家电网络平台的销售业绩占公司总销售额的比重是5%~8%。我们明年初准备推出自建的网上商城。该商城不仅仅是个销售平台，同时还是信息交换平台、品牌展示平台和用户交流平台，我们将在上面建立论坛，还要利用微博和用户互动。我们之所以用3年时间对网上商城进行前期搭建，也是考虑到网络是把‘双刃剑’，它可以把一个企业的优势和劣势都无限放大。”奥克斯网上商城也在建设中。据奥克斯有关负责人介绍，奥克斯三年前就意识到争夺网络阵地的战略意义，并于2009年9月与淘宝网展开合作。网上商城的主要作用是为企业提供宣传产品和服务的机会，拉近与客户间的距离，使企业和消费者沟通得更顺畅。“与2010年相比，2011年奥克斯在第三方网站上的销售额增长已超出预期，奥克斯正在扩充网购部门人手以应对快速增长的业务量。”如此快速增长与奥克斯的产品布局有关，奥克斯在网上销售的产品与线下有所不同，网购产品以网络专供机型为主、常规机型为补充。合作共赢新模式随着市场的壮大，2011年，家电网络营销出现了一些新模式。2010年之前，三种类型网络渠道平台一直各自为政。随着2010年11月22日国美收购库巴网，第三方家电网络平台与传统连锁渠道开始第一次合作，开创了网络渠道的新模式。改版后的国美网上商城上线后，国美电器总裁王俊洲表示，国美将采用双品牌方式参与电子商务竞争，“两个电子商务平台将共享国美的物流、采购、服务及人力资源”。面对国美与库巴网的合作，一些业内人士表示困惑。一位家电品牌企业网站管理人员认为，国美的双品牌战略是“雾里看花”。“国美网上商城和库巴网销售的都是国美线下产品，销售相同的产品必然存在竞争，而库巴网作为‘后娘养大的孩子’，在与国美网上商城的竞争中会处于不利地位，早晚会消失。”针对此种说法，彭亮表示，2011年库巴网超过300%的销售增速足以证明这种合作是正确的。“家电行业本身是高度垄断的行业，近十年来，中国家电行业没有出现比较有代表性的新品牌。由此可见，在行业内想依靠一己之力创造品牌很困难。库巴网从2006年开始在网上销售家电，是中国最早销售家电的网站，但是到2009年，我们在发展上看到了‘天花板’。我们之前面临的许多困境，包括供应链难题等，相信其他网站同样也会遇到。国美具有1000多亿元的采购规模，在行业内占据着优势地位。在与国美的合作中，我们整合了国美的供应链资源，才会有现在的规模，这种合作是一种共赢。”国美网上商城总经理韩德鹏告诉《电器》记者，国美网上商城改版上线后，一个月就实现600%的销售增长。这也从一个侧面印证了合作共赢。	彭亮,左英杰,禚洪斋,刘春华,王俊洲,韩德鹏	正向	"Home appliance e-commerce channels market development is strong, the prospects are good. After the ""May Day"" in 2011, Vice President Peng Liang of Kuba Network was a little ""fire"", this fire came from ""moving house"". In 2010, the staff of Kuba Network was only more than 200 people, and it has now exceeded 800 people. The old office was too small to accommodate so many people, so we had to move house again and again. Peng Liang said, ""The staff are still expanding. The most urgent problem at the moment is to rent a house as soon as possible, otherwise the office will not be enough again."" Not long ago, Peng Liang leased half a floor of the Ruida Building, and the office area of Kuba Network in Beijing increased by more than 1,000 square meters on the basis of 3,000 square meters, and the office area of Kuba Network across the country exceeded 10,000 square meters. The number of staff increased three times in five months. Peng Liang told the Electric Appliances reporter with no lack of pride that the growth of the number of staff was proportional to the growth of the sales on the website. In 2010, the sales of Kuba Network were 500 million yuan, and it will be between 1.5 and 2 billion yuan in 2011. During the May Day promotion this year, Kuba.com achieved sales of more than 100 million yuan. The market has developed rapidly, and it has achieved a sales scale of 100 million yuan in just a few days. This was unimaginable for most home appliance e-commerce platforms last year. In 2010, there were only a few websites in the home appliance e-commerce channel that exceeded 100 million yuan in annual sales. According to AVC data, in 2010, the scale of home appliance online shopping in China was 8 billion yuan, accounting for less than 2% of the overall scale of the home appliance market. Among the 8 billion yuan in sales, JD.com and Suning.com ranked first and second with more than 2 billion yuan, Kuba reached 500 million yuan, and Xin Qitian Electrical Network reached 550 million yuan. Taobao Electrical City and Newegg both exceeded 100 million yuan. Industry insiders said that compared with 2010, in 2011, all traditional channels will focus on the network platform, and the home appliance online market will show explosive growth. On February 23, 2011, Suning电器 released the overall development plan for 2011 with e-commerce development as the focus, announcing the establishment of a separate operating company - Suning Ebuy, parallel to the physical chain retail business, aiming to achieve a fourfold increase in sales and reach 8 billion yuan, and to achieve a sales revenue of 10 billion yuan in the near future. In April, the newly revised Gome online mall (www.gome.com.cn) was officially launched. Gome plans that in the next 2-3 years, its online mall will account for more than 10% of its sales, and will occupy more than 15% of the capacity of China's home appliance online market. Zuo Yingjie, the president of Xin Qitian Electric Appliances Network, believes that in 2011, JD Mall and Taobao Electrical City are expected to achieve a home appliance sales scale of 4 billion yuan, and Kuba and Gome Online Mall will reach 4 billion yuan in total, and Xin Qitian will achieve 500 million to 800 million yuan. If Suning can achieve a sales scale of 10 billion yuan, the scale of home appliance online sales in China in 2011 will be nearly twice that of 2010. AVC predicts that home appliance online shopping will maintain rapid growth in the next few years, and it is expected to exceed 100 billion yuan in 2015, accounting for 14% of the overall scale of the home appliance market, and becoming the third largest channel model in the home appliance market. Currently, the main competitors in the home appliance network channel in China have formed three categories of platforms, namely, third-party B2C home appliance network platforms represented by JD Mall and Taobao Home Appliances, traditional chain channel network platforms represented by Gome and Suning, and enterprise self-built network platforms represented by various brand owners. In terms of sales scale, JD Mall, Gome Appliances (including Gome Online Mall and Kuba), Suning.com, Taobao Appliances City, and Xin Qiqi Appliances Network have already established their industry status. Industry insiders say that third-party B2C home appliance network platforms and traditional chain channel network platforms are the main force in the development of network channels, and enterprise self-built websites have a smaller sales scale than the other two channels due to their single product and lack of price advantage. In 2011, the sales performance of home appliance enterprises' self-built network platforms also grew, but the increase was smaller compared to the other two major platforms. As a self-built website of the enterprise, Hisense Online Mall has been online for exactly one year from May 2010 to now. Chao Hongzhai, the general manager of Hisense Kelon's e-commerce department, said, ""So far, the sales of Hisense's online mall have exceeded the task volume set by the company at the beginning of the online launch. However, the development of China's home appliance online shopping market is so rapid that the growth of our sales scale has not reached our psychological expectations."" Meanwhile, Zhuo Hongzhai said that although Hisense had its own online mall, more than 70% of its online sales still came from third-party B2C home appliance online shopping platforms. Some companies are getting ready to build their own online shopping malls. Liu Chunhua, the executive vice president of Shuangang Group, told the Electrical Appliances that the network channel is the future direction of home appliance sales. Two years ago, ShuKang established its first online marketing department, which was the first online marketing department in the domestic kitchen appliance industry. Currently, the sales performance of Super King on third-party B2C home appliance network platforms accounts for 5% to 8% of the company's total sales. We are planning to launch our own online mall at the beginning of next year. This mall is not only a sales platform, but also an information exchange platform, a brand display platform, and a user interaction platform. We will build a forum on it, and we will also interact with users through Weibo. We took three years to set up the online mall, also considering that the Internet is a double-edged sword, which can infinitely magnify both the advantages and disadvantages of a company. The Ouxi online mall is also under construction. According to the relevant person in charge of Ouxi, Ouxi realized the strategic significance of competing for the network battlefield three years ago, and began to cooperate with Taobao in September 2009. The main function of the online mall is to provide enterprises with the opportunity to promote their products and services, to bring enterprises and customers closer, and to facilitate communication between enterprises and consumers. Compared with 2010, the sales of Oux in third-party websites in 2011 exceeded the expected growth, and Oux is expanding the manpower of the online shopping department to cope with the rapidly growing business volume. Such rapid growth is related to the product layout of Ouxi. The products sold online by Ouxi are different from those sold offline. The online products are mainly network exclusive models, with regular models as supplements. Win-win new model emerges with the growth of the market. In 2011, some new models of home appliance online marketing appeared. Until 2010, the three types of network channel platforms operated independently. With Gome's acquisition of Kuba Network on November 22, 2010, third-party home appliance online platforms began their first cooperation with traditional chain channels, creating a new model for online channels. After the launch of the new Gome online mall, Gome's president, Wang Junzhou, said that Gome would participate in the competition of e-commerce by adopting a dual brand strategy, ""the two e-commerce platforms will share Gome's logistics, procurement, service and human resources."" Some industry insiders expressed confusion over Gome and Kuba’s cooperation. An appliance brand company website manager believes that Gome's dual-brand strategy is ""like watching flowers through mist."" Both Gome Online Mall and Kuba sell Gome’s offline products. Selling the same products inevitably leads to competition. As a child “raised by a stepmother”, Kuba will be at a disadvantage in the competition with Gome Online Mall and will eventually disappear. Peng Liang said that Kuba’s sales growth of more than 300% in 2011 proved that this cooperation was correct. The home appliance industry itself is a highly monopolized industry, and in the past ten years, there has been no new brand with representative characteristics in the Chinese home appliance industry. It is therefore difficult for an individual to create a brand in the industry. Kuba.com started selling home appliances online in 2006, and was one of the first websites to sell home appliances in China. However, by 2009, we saw a 'ceiling' in our development. Many of the difficulties we have faced in the past, including supply chain challenges, are likely to be encountered by other websites as well. Gome has a purchasing scale of more than 100 billion yuan, and it occupies an advantageous position in the industry. In our cooperation with Gome, we integrated Gome's supply chain resources, which enabled us to reach the current scale. This cooperation is a win-win situation. Han Depeng, the general manager of Gome Online Mall, told the Electrical Appliances that after the Gome Online Mall was revamped and launched, it achieved a 600% increase in sales in just one month. This also serves as a side proof of win-win cooperation."
低端直板机LG发布GS106GS107GS155文/andy921在低端手机市场，向来不缺乏经典机型，比如诺基亚1系列和2系列，还有三星跟LG的众多机型。日前，LG手机在国外连续发布了三款低端直板机GS106、GS107、GS155。LGGS106和GS107设计颇为相似，主要区别我们可以从图中看出来，在于导航键的设计，GS106采用的是金属按键设计，而GS107则是塑料设计。参数上两机很相似，都采用的是一块1.5英寸128*128像素的屏幕，机身尺寸和重量都一样，尺寸为103.9x43.5x12.9mm，重约70克。从屏幕下方的字来看，两款手机主打的FM收音机都能，这在低端手机里也是一个比较好的卖点。此外，两机标配950mAh锂电池，支持GSM900/1800MHz网络以及microUSB连接。另外一款LGGS155则在手机机身颜色上打了主意，GS155推出多达五种颜色，手机的硬件参数基本跟GS106/GS107一样，屏幕都是1.5英寸128*128像素，也支持FM收音机功能，只是在尺寸和重量上略微不同，GS155机身尺寸为103.9x44.5x13.9mm，重约66.8克。GS155同样标配950mAh锂电池，支持GSM900/1800MHz网络以及microUSB连接。	andy921	正向	At the low-end straight phone market, there are always classic models, such as Nokia 1 series and 2 series, and many models from Samsung and LG. By Andy921 Recently, LG has successively released three low-end straight phones abroad, GS106, GS107, and GS155. LGGS106 and GS107 are designed quite similarly, the main difference can be seen from the picture, which lies in the design of the navigation keys, GS106 adopts a metal key design, while GS107 is a plastic design.

足球宝贝二外美女：因为梅西盼阿根廷夺冠(图)7月12日，是夏敏21岁的生日，也是南非世界杯决赛日。夏敏有一个小小的愿望，希望梅西能捧得大力神杯，也算是她最好的生日礼物了。“希望决赛是在阿根廷和巴西队之间进行。当然，最好的结果是：阿根廷夺冠、梅西进球。这是给我的最好的生日礼物。”夏敏不是很热爱足球，但她对南非世界杯却有着独特的感受，因为她喜欢狂野的非洲。喜欢旅游的夏敏，去过很多地方，她去过意大利、法国，她的下一站将是非洲。“我很想去非洲，倒不完全是因为世界杯，我喜欢待在非洲广袤的土地上，看动物大迁徙。”闭上双眼，夏敏想象着那壮丽的情形，“那是视觉和心灵的撞击。”爱屋及乌，对于梅西的迷恋也让夏敏喜欢上了阿根廷队，在已经结束的阿根廷队的两场比赛中，她都未能猜对比分，倒是猜中了巴西2比1战胜朝鲜。“我一直对亚洲球员很关注，而且我有种预感，韩国队一定会打进16强。”夏敏称倒不是因为对韩国队的喜爱，但基于都是亚洲人，她还是选择了支持韩国队。化妆支持：牛牛(东田造型)服装支持：H&M本版摄影：本报记者赵亢王远征采写：本报记者孙海光拍摄统筹：侯浩袁琳	梅西,夏敏,牛牛,东田,赵亢,王远征,孙海光,侯浩,袁琳	正向	"Football Girl Out of Town Beauty: Messi Hopes Argentina Will Win (Photos) July 12 is Xia Min's 21st birthday, also the final day of the South Africa World Cup.

Xiamin, who likes traveling, has been to many places. She has been to Italy and France, and her next destination will be Africa. I would like to go to Africa, not just because of the World Cup, I like to stay on the vast land of Africa and watch the animal migration. Close your eyes, Xia Min imagined the magnificent scene, ""It is a collision of vision and heart."" Love me, love my dog. Xia Min fell in love with the Argentine team because of Messi. In the two matches of the Argentine team that have already ended, she failed to guess the scores, but she guessed that Brazil beat Korea 2-1. I have always been interested in Asian players, and I have a feeling that the Korean team will definitely reach the 16强. Xia Min said that it was not because she liked the South Korean team, but based on the fact that they were all Asians, she still chose to support the South Korean team.

每日看盘：美元ETF回调至重大支撑昨天美股小幅跳空高开，但随后立即反转并在整个上午急剧跳水。中午时分，各大股指均已从盘中高点下跌2%或以上，同时成交量大幅放大。尽管上午的向下突破十分果断，下午大盘还是企稳并出现了一轮强劲反弹，不过收盘前最后一个小时再度迎来一定的抛盘。总体而言，下午的反弹极大地提升了多头的信心，因为它显然意味着投资者在逢低买进。罗素2000小型股指数从200日均线反弹，收盘跌幅仅为0.1%。道琼斯工业平均指数小幅下挫0.3%。标普500指数低收0.4%，标普400中型股指数和纳斯达克综合指数分别下跌0.5%和0.6%。大部分股指均收于振幅中位偏下，不过大幅高于盘中低点。成交量全面激增，纽约证交所总成交量较上一交易日放大17%，纳斯达克交易所大增26%。放量下跌使得纳指和标普500再次出现“出货日”。市场内部力量对比收于平均水平，纳斯达克下跌股成交量与上升股成交量之比为2比1，纽交所该比率为1.2比1。尽管昨天的行情从技术上来讲是一个“出货日”，但我们并不能说它是一个相当利空的交易日，因为空头和多头都有一番表现。由于接近日线图上200日均线的支撑，本周PowerSharesU.S.DollarBullIndex(UUP)重新回到了我们的观察名单之上：UUP存在一个来自2-4月份的强大水平价格支撑。周线图显示UUP此轮回调幅度为略微超过从2009年12月低点到2010年6月高点的50%斐波纳契折线，从而给我们提供了收益-风险比为正的交易机会。另外，欧元(FXE)正上涨到一个巨大的水平价格阻力，因此有可能很快恢复其下跌趋势。UUP的这一建仓形态为中长线机会，因为眼下并没有足够的正面价格动能让短线交易者可以跟进。200日均线依然在标普500指数的日线图上构成铜墙铁壁一般的阻力：尽管上周各大股指均返回50日均线上方，然而我们并未看到出现一波后续的强劲买盘，可以暗示市场已经准备启动一轮大规模上涨。在标普500指数清除200日均线的阻力之前，我们预计大盘还将出现更多宽幅振荡的价格走势。(本文作者：DeronWagnerofTheWagnerDaily)	罗素,DeronWagner	正向	"Daily watch: USD ETF bounces back to major support Yesterday, the US stock market opened slightly higher, but immediately reversed and plunged sharply in the morning. By midday, all major stock indices had fallen by more than 2% from their intraday highs, with volume also surging. Although the downward breakout in the morning was decisive, the major indices stabilized in the afternoon and rallied strongly, but there was some selling pressure in the last hour before the close. Overall, the afternoon rally greatly boosted the bulls' confidence, as it clearly meant that investors were buying on the dips. The Russell 2000 small-cap index bounced off the 200-day moving average, closing down just 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly by 0.3%. The S&P 500 closed down 0.4%, while the S&P 400 Midcap index and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Most stock indices closed slightly below the amplitude median, but well above the day's low. Volume was up across the board, with the NYSE seeing a 17% increase in volume from the previous session, and the Nasdaq up 26%. Volume declines have caused the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to see another ""distribution day"". Market internals were in line with average levels, with Nasdaq declining volume to advancing volume ratio at 2 to 1 and the NYSE ratio at 1.2 to 1. Although technically yesterday's trading day was a ""selling day"", we cannot say that it was a rather bearish trading day, as both the bears and the bulls had a good performance. Due to the support of the 200-day moving average on the daily chart, PowerShares U.S. Dollar Bull Index (UUP) has returned to our watch list this week: UUP has a strong level of price support from February to April. The weekly chart shows that UUP has retraced slightly more than 50% of the Fibonacci retracement from the December 2009 low to the June 2010 high, thus providing us with a trading opportunity with a positive risk-reward ratio. Additionally, the Euro (FXE) is rising to a huge level price resistance, so it is possible that it will soon resume its downward trend. This UUP position formation is for medium to long-term opportunities, as there is currently insufficient positive price momentum for short-term traders to follow. The 200-day moving average still constitutes a formidable resistance on the daily chart of the S&P 500: although all major indices returned above the 50-day moving average last week, we have not seen a strong follow-up buying that would suggest the market is ready to launch a major rally. Before the S&P 500 index breaks through the resistance of the 200-day moving average, we expect more wide-ranging price movements in the broader market.

老教师为救患病儿子当街卖字□记者王勇本报讯昨日，在郑州市陇海路与嵩山路交叉口的人行道上出现这样一幕：郑州市华夏中学59岁的朱永廷老师，在老伴的帮助下，摊开他书写的书法作品，一张白纸上写着：“卖字救子！”老教师的举动引起了路人的关注。“献出爱心，救救我儿子！随意捐点钱，送给您一幅我的字！”昨日上午，朱永廷在街头吆喝着。朱永廷教书有32年了，有6届高考语文成绩第一名获得者出自他的班级。朱永廷说，他老家在开封，儿子朱淼泓今年31岁，儿子4个月大时，在被人抱着的时候不慎摔倒在地，导致颅内出血，此后儿子的症状始终没有缓解，自理能力都没有。2007年，他的儿子经省人民医院和郑大第一附属医院的专家会诊，确诊为多发性神经纤维瘤病。为给儿子看病，朱永廷夫妇跑了十几个省市的医院，始终没有治好，眼下面临再次手术，但数万元费用难倒了他们。许多人路过朱永廷的“卖字摊”前时，都忍不住看上几眼，纷纷拿出钱给老教师，大部分人捐钱后并没有拿走老教师的书法作品。其中一名公司老板了解情况后，掏出1000元交给朱永廷。昨日下午，记者来到了郑州市华夏中学，学校领导和老师都说，朱永廷老师和老伴对自己身患重病的儿子始终不离不弃。“学校老师都非常感动，我们多次要为他们家捐款，遭到了他们的拒绝。”	王勇,朱永廷,朱淼泓	正向	"An elderly teacher sold calligraphy to save his sick son on the street. □ By Wang Yong. Zhengzhou News Agency. Yesterday, a scene appeared on the sidewalk at the intersection of Longhai Road and Songshan Road in Zhengzhou: 59-year-old Zhu Yongting, a teacher at Zhonghua Middle School in Zhengzhou, helped by his wife, spread out his calligraphy works he had written, and wrote on a white paper: ""Sell calligraphy to save my son!"" The old teacher's actions attracted the attention of passers-by. Give love and save my son! Donate a little money, and I will send you a piece of my calligraphy! Zhu Yongting was shouting on the street in the morning yesterday. Zhu Yongting has been teaching for 32 years, and six of his students have won the first place in the college entrance examination Chinese language test. Zhu Yongting said that his hometown was Kaifeng, and his son Zhu Miaohong was 31 years old this year. When his son was four months old, he fell to the ground accidentally while being held by someone, resulting in intracranial hemorrhage. Since then, his son's symptoms have not been relieved, and he has no self-care ability. In 2007, his son was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis after a consultation of experts from the Provincial People's Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Zhu Yongting and his wife have run to hospitals in more than ten provinces and cities for their son's illness, but they have not been cured. Now they are facing another surgery, but the tens of thousands of yuan in costs have made them feel helpless. Many people who passed by Zhu Yongting's ""calligraphy stall"" couldn't help but take a few looks, and many of them gave money to the elderly teacher. After most people donated money, they did not take the teacher's calligraphy works. After one of the company bosses learned about the situation, he took out 1000 yuan and handed it to Zhu Yongting. Yesterday afternoon, the reporters came to Zhongzhou City Huaxia Middle School. The school leaders and teachers said that Teacher Yongting Zhu and his wife never abandoned their son who was seriously ill. The school teachers were deeply moved, and we wanted to donate money to their family several times, but they refused. """
汇金大手笔增持能否掀起行情■主持人：陈琼■特约嘉宾：资深市场评论家秦洪■特约嘉宾：信达证券分析师马佳颖主持人：据建行12月2日晚间发布的公告，汇金公司自9月23日至11月28日，已通过上海证券交易所增持建设银行A股股份超过7000万股。这是汇金公司第二次出手增持建行股份，和之前增持200万股相比，汇金此次出手颇为“豪气”，你们觉得透露出什么信息？秦洪：一是保持持股的稳定，因为外资银行将持有更多的建行股权。二是为了向市场昭示汇金稳定A股市场走势的努力。马佳颖：10月份以来，管理层针对实体经济的利好可谓是“出手快，出拳重”，如果说“9·19”三大利好是管理层为了提振市场信心而出台的，有些“意思一下”的感觉，那么这次对资本市场的关注则是来“真格”的了，这从汇金近期大手笔增持建行就能够看出来。主持人：建设银行12月2日发布的公告同时称，汇金公司完成向美国银行转让其持有的建设银行195.8亿股H股，美国银行持股比例上升到19.13％。对于美国银行大举增持建行股份，有市场人士认为此举是为其减持做铺垫。怎么看？马佳颖：美国银行在本土遭遇金融危机、资本充足率和流动性都陷入困境的时候，为什么还大举增持建行股票，是值得思考的。按照协议约定，美国银行此次增持在2011年8月29日之前不能转让，所以短期内大举减持的可能性不大。主持人：汇金的增持举动会给A股市场和银行股带来怎样的影响？秦洪:对A股市场来说，会改善预期，至少可以向市场折射出管理层稳定市场的努力以及背后的期望值。对于银行股来说，则可以带来估值的改善，同时也向市场表示银行股的价值已明显，银行股或将迎来底部。马佳颖：我认为，第一，由于前期以基金为主的机构资金还在大规模减持权重股，特别是银行股，那么此次汇金的增持，有管理层间接树立机构投资者信心的意思；第二，近期A股市场走势摆脱外盘干扰，在30日均线和60日均线之间窄幅震荡，而随着做多热情的逐渐消耗，市场能够维持多长时间的盘整不好说，汇金在现阶段大举增持银行股，会在一定程度上稳定市场重心，为1900点附近的支撑再增添一个筹码。不过从全球经济走势和我国的预期来看，我们并不看好A股市场的系统性机会，因此汇金增持银行股，我个人认为只是稳定市场，不能带来银行股和A股市场的大幅上涨。主持人:昨天午后大盘呈现久违的放量上升势头，是不是也是得益于汇金增持带来的提振作用？秦洪:之间存在着一定的必然联系，这一信号与前期社保基金增加二级市场股票投资等联系在一起，向市场折射出政策面继续回暖的态势。马佳颖：在政策做多的背景下，市场人气被充分调动，但是银行股、煤炭股等大盘权重股的上涨，和投机资金参与的题材股不同，它一定是要有基本面支撑，而现在显然不具备这样的环境。所以，我个人对蓝筹股的上涨持谨慎态度，有可能意味着反弹已经进入尾声。主持人:汇金增持、社保基金增仓等一系列举动是不是可以视为“市场底部已经到来”的信号？秦洪:这并不存在必然的逻辑推理。马佳颖：目前沪指再次来到60日均线附近，这已经是反弹以来第三次冲击这个关键的点位，这个时候蓝筹股启动，有带动股指强行冲关的意图，但是如果是靠拉抬指数突破60日均线，我个人感觉可持续性不强。下一交易日大盘走势判断您目前的仓位	陈琼,秦洪,马佳颖	正向	"Can the large-scale increase in holdings by China Investment Corporation trigger a market rally? Host: Chen Qiong Special guest: Senior market commentator Qin Hong Special guest: Cinda Securities Analyst Ma Jiaying Host: According to the announcement released by China Construction Bank on the evening of December 2, China Investment Corporation has increased its holdings of China Construction Bank A-shares through the Shanghai Stock Exchange by more than 70 million shares from September 23 to November 28. This is the second time that Huijin has increased its holdings in ICBC. Compared with the previous purchase of 20 million shares, Huijin's move this time is quite ""generous"". What do you think it reveals? Qin Hong: One is to maintain the stability of shareholding, because foreign banks will hold more shares of the Bank of Communications. Second, to demonstrate the efforts of CSFI to stabilize the A-share market. Jiaying Ma: Since October, the authorities have been taking swift and forceful measures to boost the real economy. If the three favorable measures announced on September 19 were intended to boost market confidence, they were more of a “show of support,” then this time the authorities have really taken the issue of the capital market seriously, as can be seen from the recent large-scale purchase of shares of China Construction Bank by China Investment Corporation. The host said that the announcement released by the Construction Bank on December 2 also said that H-share of 19.58 billion shares held by the China Huarong Asset Management Company was transferred to Bank of America, and the shareholding ratio of Bank of America increased to 19.13%. Some market players believe that the US bank’s large-scale increase in its holdings of ICBC shares is a prelude to its subsequent reduction. How do you see it? Ma Jiaying: It is worth thinking about why US banks, when facing a financial crisis at home, a capital adequacy ratio and liquidity in trouble, still massively increased their holdings of shares in ICBC. As stipulated in the agreement, the US bank's increase in holdings cannot be transferred before August 29, 2011, so it is unlikely to make a large-scale reduction in the short term. The host: How will CICC's increase in holdings affect the A-share market and bank stocks? Qin Hong: It will improve expectations for the A-share market, at least it can reflect the efforts of the management to stabilize the market and the underlying expectations. For bank stocks, this can also improve valuation and signal to the market that bank stocks have clearly become undervalued, and bank stocks may have reached the bottom. Jiaying Ma: I think, first, due to the large-scale reduction of weight stocks, especially bank stocks, by institutional funds mainly based on funds in the early stage, the increase of Huijin this time has the meaning of indirectly establishing the confidence of institutional investors by the management; second, in the recent A-share market, the trend has been摆脱the interference of the foreign market and has been oscillating in a narrow range between the 30-day moving average and the 60-day moving average. It is not easy to say how long the market can maintain a consolidation, and Huijin's large-scale increase of bank stocks at this stage will to some extent stabilize the market center and add another support to the support around 1900 points. However, given the global economic trends and our expectations, we do not see a systemic opportunity in the A-share market. Therefore, I believe that the CSRC's purchase of bank stocks is only to stabilize the market and will not lead to a significant rise in bank stocks and the A-share market. Host: Yesterday afternoon, the market showed a rare volume increase, was it also due to the boost brought by the increase in holdings by China Securities Finance Corporation? Qin Hong: There is a certain necessary connection between the two. This signal, together with the increase of the social security fund's investment in the secondary market, reflects the trend of continued warming of the policy face. Jiaying Ma: With the market enthusiasm fully mobilized under the background of policy support, the rise of large-cap weight stocks such as bank stocks and coal stocks is different from that of theme stocks participated by speculative funds. It must have a fundamental support, but the current environment obviously does not have such an environment. So, I am personally cautious about the blue chips, which may mean that the rebound is coming to an end. Host: Can a series of actions such as CMBI's increase in holdings and the Social Security Fund's increase in its position be regarded as a signal that ""the market bottom has arrived""? Qin Hong: There is no necessary logical inference. Ma Jiaying: Currently, the Shangzheng Index has returned to the vicinity of the 60-day moving average. This is the third time that this key point has been challenged since the rebound. At this time, the blue chips are starting, with the intention of forcing the index to break through the 60-day moving average. However, if the index is pushed to break through the 60-day moving average by pulling up the index, I personally feel that its sustainability is not strong.

主持人东方卫视《我和春天有个约会》拼歌技新浪娱乐讯全国各地的主持人们在百忙之中齐聚东方春晚的舞台，除了唱歌跳舞外，所有主持人都转型成了“魔术师”，让观众眼前一亮。这是由东方卫视倾情打造的17天东方春晚的一台重头戏——《我和春天有个约会》，到今年已经是第六届了，为了迎接世博会的到来，虎年的《约会》全面升级，将于今晚(大年初八)19：30在东方卫视播出。全国名嘴倾情加盟浙江卫视朱丹新歌首唱因为2009全国主持人《舞林大会》的热播，不少全国各台的名嘴都和东方卫视结下了深厚的感情，此次《我和春天有个约会》更是真正意义上成为了主持人的嘉年华聚会，来自浙江卫视的当家花旦朱丹、北京卫视的美女主持陈晨、新疆卫视的娜地拉、云南卫视的江钰婷、安徽卫视的开心果张杨果而都倾情加盟，除了美女主持，还有沈凌、刘刚、刘尔金等多位全能男主持的加入，载歌载舞，使出浑身解数，不少各台名嘴都是放下手头的重要节目来到东方卫视。为此，本台晚会的总策划林海表示了感激之情：“特别谢谢这些其他电视台的主持人，真的非常辛苦。”浙江卫视的当家花旦朱丹，更是选择了在《我和春天有个约会》首度开唱她的最新单曲《想起》，她牵着林海的手表示：“谢谢生命中的很多人，我很珍惜你们。”外国歌曲信手拈来曹可凡跳起“Nobody”《我和春天有个约会》今年有了明确的主题，晚会分为几个部分，首先是生肖歌曲轮唱，程雷的《龙的传人》，倪琳的《千年等一回》都博得阵阵掌声。为了迎接世博，此次主持人都被要求唱起了外国歌曲，这些当然难不倒“嘴上功夫”了得的他们，无论是金炜模仿的Vitas，还是倪琳用日语倾情献的《血疑》主题曲，都将晚会带向了高潮。你方唱罢我登场，除了演绎动听歌曲，当然还少不了跳舞，特别是精心编排的2009年度最红舞蹈“Nobody”一度掀起了现场的高潮，曹可凡、刘刚这些平时完全和舞蹈沾不上边的男主持，竟然成为了主角，憨态可掬的表演，加上敦实的身材，现场观众笑声连连，留下了深刻的印象，林海透露：“让曹老师跳这个舞，我们采取了慢慢渗透的办法。”曹可凡本人也激动表示：“我就排练了一天，主要就是做林海的垫背。”戴军“复古”唱《阿莲》今年《我和春天有个约会》还有个板块就是经典老歌回顾，曹可凡坐在摩托车上翻唱了王杰的《安妮》，颇有一番滋味，红遍大江南北的《阿莲》原唱者戴军，时隔多年再次唱起熟悉的旋律，现场的观众报以热烈的掌声，不少都红了眼眶，背景更是配上了当年戴军演绎《阿莲》的风采。每个年代的观众都在一首首金曲中重拾往昔的种种。名嘴表演魔术“洋相百出”今年特别增加的魔术，也被总策划林海称为“最困难”的表演：“让主持人唱歌跳舞完全难不倒他们，但是表演魔术就有不少麻烦了。”丹丹、娜地拉和贝贝表演的快速换装，令人啧啧称奇；程雷、王冠、晓峰和江钰婷表演了扣人心弦的漂浮术，当王冠成功地漂浮在半空中，观众们连连发出惊叹，到了周瑾、吉雪萍等四位女主持这里，就颇为尴尬了——先是周瑾“大变活鱼”的小鱼提前跳出来，再是王冠的“甩绳变鱼”的金鱼死死咬住她的衣服不放，这场魔术带给观众的更多是笑意。不过，平时忙于工作的主持人能够在短时间内领悟魔术要领，还是值得肯定的。总策划林海谦虚地表示：“我对收视率不敢期待，今年只是试水。”	东方,朱丹,陈晨,娜地拉,江钰婷,张杨果而,沈凌,刘刚,刘尔金,林海,曹可凡,程雷,倪琳,金炜,戴军,王杰,安妮,丹丹,贝贝,王冠,晓峰,周瑾,吉雪萍,林海谦	正向	"Hosts from all over the country gathered on the stage of the Spring Festival Gala of Dongfang Satellite TV to compete in singing skills. Apart from singing and dancing, all hosts transformed into ""magicians"" and amazed the audience. This is a major event of the 17-day Spring Festival Gala of the Eastern Satellite TV, ""My Appointment with Spring"", which has been held for the sixth time this year. In order to welcome the World Expo, the ""appointment"" of the Year of the Tiger has been comprehensively upgraded and will be broadcast on the Eastern Satellite TV at 7:30 p.m. tonight (the eighth day of the first month). All the famous hosts from all over the country have joined Zhejiang TV for Zhu Dan's first song. Because of the popularity of the 2009 nationwide host ""Dance in the Forest"", many famous hosts from all over the country have developed a deep affection for the Eastern Satellite TV. This time, ""I Have an Appointment with Spring"" has truly become a carnival party for hosts. The leading lady Zhu Dan from Zhejiang TV, Chen Chen, the beautiful host from Beijing Satellite TV, Nadiya from Xinjiang Satellite TV, Jiang Yuting from Yunnan Satellite TV, and Zhang Yangguoer, the happy nut from Anhui Satellite TV, have all joined in. In addition to the beautiful hosts, Shen Ling, Liu Gang, Liu Erjin, and other multi-talented male hosts have also joined in, singing and dancing, using all their skills. Many famous hosts from all over the country have come to the Eastern Satellite TV to drop their important programs. For this, Lin Hai, the overall planner of the evening, expressed his gratitude: ""I would like to especially thank the hosts from other TV stations, who really worked very hard."" Zhejiang TV's leading lady Zhu Dan chose to debut her latest single ""Think of"" at ""Me and Spring Have an Appointment"". She held hands with Lin Hai and said, ""Thank you to everyone in my life. I cherish you very much."" Foreign songs are at hand, and Cao Kefan dances to ""Nobody"" and ""I Have an Appointment with Spring"". This year's evening has a clear theme, and the evening is divided into several parts. The first part is the round singing of zodiac songs, and Cheng Lei's ""Descendants of the Dragon"" and Ni Lin's ""A Thousand Years in Waiting"" have won applause. To welcome the World Expo, the hosts were required to sing foreign songs. Of course, they were not difficult for them, who were good at singing. Whether it was Jin Wei's imitation of Vitas, or Ni Lin's passionate rendition of the theme song of ""Blood and Love"" in Japanese, it brought the party to a climax. You sing and I dance, in addition to performing beautiful songs, of course, there is also dancing, especially the most popular dance of 2009, ""Nobody"", which once brought the climax of the scene. Cao Kefan, Liu Gang, these male hosts who are completely unrelated to dancing, unexpectedly became the main characters. The clumsy and lovable performance, combined with the sturdy figure, made the audience laugh continuously, leaving a deep impression. Lin Hai revealed: ""To make Teacher Cao dance this dance, we took a gradual infiltration approach."" Cao Kefan himself was also excited to say, ""I only rehearsed for one day, mainly to be the cushion for Lin Hai."" “Dai Jun” Retro “sang “Ailian” this year. There is also a section of classic old songs in “I have an appointment with spring”. Cao Ke Fan sang Wang Jie’s “Annie” on a motorcycle, which was quite a taste. Dai Jun, the original singer of “Ailian” that was popular all over the country, sang the familiar melody again after many years. The audience at the scene gave a warm applause, and many of them were red-eyed. The background was also equipped with Dai Jun’s style when he performed “Ailian” in the past. Each generation of viewers relives the past in a series of golden songs. The hosts' performance of magic tricks was a real embarrassment this year, and the performance of magic, which was specially added this year and was called the ""most difficult"" by Lin Hai, the overall planner: it is not difficult for the hosts to sing and dance, but performing magic is troublesome. Dandan, Nali and Beibei's quick costume change amazed everyone; Cheng Lei, Wang Guan, Xiaofeng and Jiang Yuting performed a heart-stirring floating act. When Wang Guan successfully floated in mid-air, the audience was amazed. When it came to the four female hosts, Zhou Jin, Jixueping, and the others, it was rather embarrassing. First, Zhou Jin's little fish came out of the fish tank early, and then Wang Guan's goldfish bit her clothes tightly, refusing to let go. This magic show brought more laughter to the audience.

南非欧风劲爆桑巴狂舞郁金含苞待放斗牛需战胜自己随着西班牙在伊比利亚半岛“德比”胜出，南非世界杯的“八骏图”也全部出炉。南美球队占据半壁江山，欧洲球队占据了其中的三个席位，又一场欧美大战即将上演。而亚非两片大陆只有加纳晋级八强，也使亚非足球继续生活在欧美足球的夹缝之中。郁金飘香提及荷兰，不由让人想起了田园风光与风车轮转，而他们的足球，则往往是悲情的代言词。这不是一个笑话，荷兰足球引领了全攻全守、进攻足球的风暴，但是他们从来没有在世界杯中夺魁过。不过这次，郁金香终于等到了含苞待放的时候，罗本、斯内德、范佩西等一大群优秀球员的出现，让荷兰人看到了金杯的闪光。而范马尔维克的战术体系，在符合时下盛行的打法同时，也将荷兰球员的特点发挥得淋漓尽致。并且在这位慈父的带领下，荷兰球员摒弃了所有个人恩怨，将所有的心思都放在比赛之中。好牙遇硬骨头锋利的西班“牙”虽然有好胃口，但这次遇到了巴拉圭这块“硬”骨头。网友小跳斗牛狂想伊比利亚半岛从来都不会缺少探索的足迹，从哥伦布开始，众多的航海家都从这里出发，面对神秘的前景，在时刻充满威胁的航道上航行。如今的西班牙人继承了前辈们对于未知领域的好奇心，朝着他们第一座金杯迈进。华美优雅又带着刺客冷峻面容的斗牛士们，即将面对防守反击战素养极高的巴拉圭人。对于西班牙人而言，能够战胜他们的只剩下他们自己，没有夺冠经验的他们，或许顶不住心理的压力，状态不佳的托雷斯，或许无法重现金童的风采。如果西班牙能够将所有不利的因素通通顺利解决，那么在这场欧美对话中，高傲的欧洲人将再一次笑到最后。意志战车在欧洲足球的版图上，永远都存在这样一股强大势力，那就是有着顽强意志严明纪律的德意志战车。在解决了英格兰之后，他们将要对阵另一个“世仇”阿根廷队，这不仅仅是一场1/4决赛，更是一场关系到欧洲足球荣耀的比赛。德国和阿根廷之间的宿仇由来已久，在上一届德国世界杯当中，同样是在1/4决赛，德国人点球淘汰阿根廷，几乎创造了“冬天的童话”。但在本届世界杯上，我们看到了一支似曾相识但又不是非常熟悉的德国队。同样拥有钢铁般的意志，同样拥有铁血般的精神，这支德国队中更柔和了阿根廷人精湛的前场配合以及脚下技术。德国队在节节胜利的同时，带给我们极具冲击力的视觉享受。而笼罩在德国队身上的另一层光环则是阳光帅气。越来越多的女球迷爱上了德国队，而德国队主帅勒夫则成为潮流的代言词。在本赛季的欧洲各项比赛当中，德国人永远处于话题的中央，德国青年队在欧洲青年锦标赛中连连夺冠，德国的俱乐部球队纷纷杀入欧洲顶级联赛，这一系列利好消息让德国足球重新回到了一流球队的行列。对于目前的德国队而言，最大的问题就是球队过于年轻，而如果他们能够摆正心态，那么在南非的土地上，这群年轻人很有可能演绎一出精彩的“冬天童话”。非洲沙化非洲足球曾经带给我们太多惊喜，1990年的意大利之夏，喀麦隆人在揭幕战力克潘帕斯雄鹰；2002年的韩日世界杯，塞内加尔的青年禁卫军又一次让法国人俯首称臣。然而这一次在南非，他们几乎全军覆没，如果不是加纳人抓住了最后的救命稻草，非洲人将以耻辱结束本届世界杯。加纳足球在本届世界杯的出色表现，让所有球迷都眼前一亮，他们有着南美人细腻的脚法，而一群效力于欧洲联赛的球员又给他们带来了欧洲足球的整体概念。同时，加纳人又给非洲球队提了个醒，那就是要合理利用移民这股力量，加纳队中的23号球员博阿滕，出生在德国，此前拥有加纳和德国双重国籍，而且也曾经入选过德国的青年队但在世界杯开始之前，加纳足协接受了他，他顺利代表加纳出战，并且在几场比赛中都有上佳发挥，而类似博阿滕这种经历的球员在欧洲一抓一大把。本届世界杯，非洲球队实力的下降是有目共睹的，排除分组这个运气因素，非洲球队没有表现出必胜的决心。这两年，阻碍非洲足球发展的因素越来越多，很少有非洲国家有完备的联赛机制，而越来越多的青少年没有系统的青训指导，并且欧洲联赛一再限制非欧盟球员的加盟，也让越来越多向往欧洲联赛的年轻人放弃了本国国籍。由于贫穷导致的一系列不利因素，已经让曾经辉煌的非洲足球陷入到足球沙漠之中。亚洲期待需要感谢韩国和日本，如果不是这两支球队在本届世界杯上的出色发挥，亚洲恐怕又将无人问津。打法细化、任意球功底以及跑不死精神已经成为亚洲的旗帜，韩国队在这些基础上多了球星的概念，而日本足球在经过许多年的摸索后也有了自己的锋线尖刀。本届世界杯注定将成为朴智星和本田圭佑发挥的舞台，继首场比赛进球之后，朴智星在接下来的比赛中场场都成为韩国队全队的核心力量，即使在落后的时候，韩国人依然在朴老大的带领下奋勇向前。而日本小将本田圭佑更是成为了日本队的灵魂人物，他的细腻脚法以及在前场的拼劲让全世界领教了亚洲的力量。本届世界杯，亚洲拥有4.5个参赛名额，最终晋级到32强的4支球队都给世界留下了印象，随着韩国和日本队闯入16强，亚足联可以理直气壮地向成绩不佳的非洲足联讨取一个参赛名额。当然想要真正与世界强队抗衡，亚洲足球还有许多重要的事情要做，拒绝黑哨、拒绝假球这些喊了多年的口号依然没能制止赌球势力对亚洲足球的不利影响。而亚洲足球不能只靠日本韩国，西亚球队以及我们中国必须尽快迎头而上。圭兄圭弟“圭氏兄弟”的成功有分组运气，另一方面也靠着球队的整体实力。巴拉圭队一直秉承球队防守坚固的优点，他们在4场比赛中，仅丢1球，出色的防守让所有球队望尘莫及。而在接下来的比赛中，巴拉圭将要迎战西班牙队，面对火力十足的西班牙队，巴拉圭队是否能够延续他们良好的防守将至关重要。相比巴拉圭队的整体，乌拉圭队则更讲究个人技术，弗兰以及苏亚雷斯的个人能力将成为加纳队后防线的恶魔。当然乌拉圭队薄弱的中场控制能力将很有可能让他们在比赛中陷入被动。当然，这两支球队在本届世界杯中有一个很大的优势，那就是他们的许多球员都是来自于本国联赛。由于欧洲职业联赛的负担实在太重，许多大牌球员在赛前伤病缠身，而且欧洲联赛直到世界杯开赛前半月才全部结束，因此对于欧洲球员来说，身体和心理的双重疲惫，让南美球队在本届比赛中更加出彩。雄鹰风采谁都没有想到马拉多纳和他的阿根廷能在本届世界杯上一帆风顺，在外界看来，这个踢球超一流、人品三流、执教能力不入流的教练会让阿根廷队掉入到万劫不复的深渊中。但大家都错了，马拉多纳的认真和他的执着，已经让潘帕斯雄鹰脱胎换骨。在马拉多纳将梅西成功塑造成一个前腰后，从前锋线上后撤到中场的梅西逐渐崭露头角，但是让所有阿根廷球迷感到郁闷的是，梅西到目前为止依然没有进球。倒是伊瓜因在他的助攻下，登上了射手榜的榜首。阿根廷作为巴西最好的帮手，负载着为南美洲淘汰德国队的光荣使命，随着球队走上正轨，这些小精灵用他们完美的表现寄托着对于冠军的渴望。巴西人在南美足坛的统治地位无人能及。在里约热内卢的街头巷尾，到处都可以看到踢球的男孩，正是这样的氛围，造就了五星巴西的辉煌。邓加率领阳光男孩卡卡、单车少年罗比尼奥、怒吼天尊卢西奥，无论巴西队到哪里，他们都是聚光灯下的焦点。而桑巴军团在之前的4场比赛中的发挥，以及天时地利人和的优势，让我们看到了第六颗星的希望。巴西队一来到南非就享受到了其他球队所没有的待遇，南非境内绝大多数球迷除了支持本国球队之外，最支持的当属巴西队，巴西队在南非队出局之后，成为了南非球迷最大的精神寄托。而迄今为止在南半球举办的世界杯都是南美球队获得最终冠军，也让信奉魔咒学说的球迷更加期待巴西队的表演。在本届世界杯上，邓加的球队在战术选择上更加欧洲化。在防守反击战术大行其道的今天，巴西人同样加入到了这个战术的行列，在比赛中，你会发现优美的桑巴舞不见了，取而代之的是务实的传切配合。而如果让巴西人用“欧洲的方式”击败欧洲球队最终夺魁的话，那么欧洲球队是否应该在今后的比赛中多多汲取美洲球队的优点呢？见习记者陈欣闻四分之一决赛时间表荷兰VS巴西7月2日CCTV-522:00乌拉圭VS加纳7月3日CCTV-502∶30德国VS阿根廷7月3日CCTV-522:00巴拉圭VS西班牙7月4日CCTV-502∶30	郁金,罗本,斯内德,范佩西,范马尔维克,圭,哥伦布,托雷斯,勒夫,潘帕斯,博阿滕,朴智星,本田圭佑,弗兰,苏亚雷斯,马拉多纳,梅西,伊瓜因,邓加,卡卡,罗比尼奥,卢西奥,陈欣闻	正向	"South African European wind powerful samba dance, saffron bud, bullfighting needs to win yourself, with Spain's victory in the ""Derby"" on the Iberian Peninsula, the ""eight horses"" of the South African World Cup are all out. South American teams occupy half of the seats, European teams occupy three of them, and another battle between Europe and America is about to take place. And with only Ghana qualifying for the quarter-finals from the two continents of Asia and Africa, Asian and African football continue to live in the shadow of European and American football. The scent of turmeric evokes the Dutch countryside and windmills, while their football is often a symbol of tragedy. This is not a joke, Dutch football led the storm of total football and attacking football, but they have never won the World Cup. But this time, the tulip finally waited for the bud to bloom, and the appearance of a group of excellent players such as Robben, Sneijder, and van Persie made the Dutch people see the glitter of the golden cup. And Van Marwijk's tactical system not only met the prevailing style of play at the time, but also brought out the best in the characteristics of the Dutch players. And under the guidance of this benevolent father, the Dutch players put aside all personal grudges and focused all their thoughts on the game. Good teeth met a sharp Spanish ""tooth"" although the Spanish ""tooth"" had a good appetite, but this time it met Paraguay, a ""hard"" tooth. Little Hop Bullfight Fantasy, there is never a lack of exploratory footsteps on the Iberian Peninsula, from Columbus, many sailors set out from here, facing the mysterious prospect, sailing on the routes full of threats. The Spaniards of today inherit their predecessors' curiosity about the unknown and move towards their first golden cup. The bullfighters, who are elegant, beautiful, and have the cold face of an assassin, will soon face the Paraguayans, who are highly skilled in counter-attacks. For the Spanish, the only thing that can defeat them is themselves. Without any experience of winning, they may not be able to withstand the psychological pressure. Torres, who is in poor form, may not be able to recapture the magic of the golden boy. If Spain were to resolve all the adverse factors, the proud Europeans would once again come out on top in the transatlantic dialogue. In the map of European football, there has always been a powerful force, that is, the German war chariot with a strong will and strict discipline. After defeating England, they will face another ""rival"", Argentina, in the quarter-finals, which is not only a quarter-final match, but also a match that concerns the honor of European football. There has been a long-standing grudge between Germany and Argentina. In the last Germany World Cup, in the 1/4 final, the Germans eliminated Argentina by penalty shootout, almost creating a ""winter fairy tale"". But in this World Cup, we saw a Germany team that was familiar but not entirely familiar. With the same iron will and the same iron blood, this German team is more gentle, with the exquisite front cooperation and foot skills of the Argentinians. The German team, while winning game after game, has brought us a visual feast with a strong impact. Another halo that envelops the German team is sunny and handsome. More and more female fans are falling in love with the German team, and coach Löw has become a spokesperson for the trend. In this season's European competitions, the Germans were always at the center of the topic. The German youth team won the European youth championship one after another, and the German club teams rushed into the top European leagues. This series of good news has made German football return to the ranks of top teams. For the current German team, the biggest problem is that the team is too young, and if they can adjust their mindset, these young people may perform a wonderful ""winter fairy tale"" on the land of South Africa. The Sahara of Africa African football has brought us too many surprises. In the summer of 1990, Cameroon defeated the Pampas Eagles in the opening match in Italy; in the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup, the young guards of Senegal once again made the French bow. However, this time in South Africa, they were almost wiped out, and if it were not for the Ghanaians grabbing the last straw, the Africans would have ended the World Cup with a shame. Ghana's excellent performance in this World Cup has made all fans dazzled, they have the South American delicate footwork, and a group of players in European leagues have brought the overall concept of European football to them. At the same time, the Ghanaians also reminded the African teams to make good use of the power of immigration. The No. 23 player of the Ghana team, Boadu, was born in Germany and previously had dual citizenship of Ghana and Germany, and he had also been selected into the German youth team. However, before the World Cup, the Ghana Football Association accepted him, and he successfully represented Ghana to play, and performed excellently in several matches. There are many players with similar experiences in Europe. The decline in the strength of African teams in this World Cup is obvious, excluding the luck factor of the group, African teams have not shown the determination to win. In recent years, there have been more and more factors hindering the development of football in Africa. Few African countries have a complete league system, and more and more teenagers lack systematic youth training guidance. And the European league has repeatedly restricted the joining of non-EU players, which has also made more and more teenagers who aspire to the European league give up their nationality. Due to a series of unfavorable factors caused by poverty, African football, which was once glorious, has fallen into a football desert. Asia would have been left out again if not for the excellent performance of South Korea and Japan in this World Cup. The fine details of the tactics, the free-kick skills, and the never-give-up spirit have become the banner of Asia. The Korean team has the concept of stars on this basis, while the Japanese football, after many years of exploration, has its own striker. This World Cup will be a stage for Park Ji-sung and Kiyoshi Hasebe to show their talents. After scoring in the first match, Park Ji-sung became the core force of the whole team of South Korea in the following matches, and even when South Korea was behind, the South Koreans still fought bravely under the leadership of Park, the big boss. And the young Japanese player Gouzo Honda became the soul of the Japanese team, his delicate footwork and fighting spirit in the front field made the whole world feel the strength of Asia. This World Cup, Asia has 4.5 spots, and the four teams that ultimately qualified for the 32 teams all left an impression on the world. With South Korea and Japan advancing to the 16th place, AFC can reasonably demand a spot from the underperforming CAF. Of course, in order to really compete with the world's top teams, Asian football still has a lot of important things to do. Refusing black whistle and refusing fake games, these slogans that have been shouted for many years have not yet stopped the negative impact of gambling forces on Asian football. And Asian football cannot rely solely on Japan, South Korea, and the西亚球队 Middle Eastern teams; we in China must catch up as soon as possible. The success of the brothers Gu has a share of luck, on the other hand, it also relies on the team's overall strength. Paraguay has always been good at defending, and they only conceded 1 goal in 4 matches, their excellent defense is beyond the reach of all teams. In the next match, Paraguay will face Spain. Whether Paraguay can continue their good defense against the powerful Spain will be crucial. Compared with the whole of Paraguay, Uruguay is more skilled in individual skills, and the individual abilities of Franch and Suarez will become the devil of Ghana's back line. Of course, Uruguay's weak midfield control will likely put them at a disadvantage in the match. Of course, both of these teams have a big advantage in this World Cup, that is, many of their players come from their own leagues. Due to the heavy burden of European professional leagues, many big-name players were injured before the games, and the European leagues did not end until half a month before the World Cup, so for European players, the dual fatigue of body and mind made South American teams more outstanding in this tournament. Who could have imagined that Maradona and Argentina would sail smoothly through the World Cup, with the outside world believing that this first-class player, third-class person, and unskilled coach would lead the Argentine team to an irretrievable abyss. But everyone was wrong, Maradona's seriousness and perseverance have already transformed the Pampas Eagles. After Messi was successfully molded into a playmaker by Maradona, Messi gradually emerged from the midfield after retreating from the forward line, but it disappointed all Argentine fans that Messi has not scored so far. Instead, Iguan was at the top of the scorer list with his assist. As Argentina’s best helper for Brazil, it bears the glorious mission of eliminating Germany from South America. With the team on track, these little sprites寄托 their longing for the championship with their perfect performance. Brazil's dominance in South American football is unparalleled. In the streets and alleys of Rio de Janeiro, you can see boys playing football everywhere, and it is this atmosphere that has created the glory of Brazil with five stars. Deng Jia led the Sun Boys, Kaka, the Bike Boy, Robinio, and the Roaring Lu Xio, and wherever the Brazilian team went, they were the focus of the spotlight. And the performance of the Samba军团 in the previous four matches, as well as the advantage of heaven, earth, and people, has given us hope for the sixth star. Brazil was treated differently from other teams as soon as it arrived in South Africa, and most of the fans in South Africa, apart from supporting their own teams, supported Brazil the most. After the South African team was eliminated, the Brazilian team became the spiritual寄托of the South African fans. So far, all the World Cups held in the Southern Hemisphere have been won by South American teams, which has made fans who believe in the curse even more eager to see Brazil's performance. In this World Cup, Dunga's team has become more European in its tactical choices. With counter-attacking tactics in vogue today, the Brazilians have also joined the ranks of this tactic. In the match, you will find that the beautiful samba dance is gone, replaced by practical passing and cutting cooperation. And if a Brazilian team were to defeat European teams in the European way and ultimately win the trophy, should European teams learn from the strengths of American teams in future matches?

豪格否认奔驰考虑撤离F1未来规则将决定三叉星去留新浪体育讯　奔驰汽车运动主管罗伯特-豪格辟谣，否认奔驰可能因迈凯轮“伪证门”事件撤出F1。本周三德国媒体《stuttgarter-zeitung》在一篇采访戴姆勒监事会成员HelmutLense的报道中中分析指出，迫于全球低迷的汽车产业现状，外加迈凯轮可能因“伪证门”事件遭到FIA的进一步处罚。迈凯轮车队40%的大股东奔驰可能撤出F1。今天在巴林，三叉星的汽车主管诺伯特-豪格对此予以了否认。“有些人暗示奔驰会退出F1。NO，奔驰不会退出。”豪格周五在巴林对《汽车运动》说道。但德国人承认如今的产业现状，的确使得汽车厂商的参赛行为存在不确定性。“当然，每一个诚实的人都在考虑当前的情况，这是事实。我们的赞助行为，的确始终存在不确定。我无法预知汽车行业在未来两个月、三个月、四个月或者五个月会发生什么、没法预知行业情况是否会好转。但如果你的车卖的多了，那你的情况肯定就会更好。”豪格分析说道。随后他指出，决定奔驰是否长期效忠F1并非人们热议的“伪证门”事件，而是F1未来几年是套怎样的规则，特别F1可能引入预算帽的问题。“当前，一切完全照旧。媒体的理解是——只要你面临FIA的听证会，那他们就会认为你的将来会陷入疑问。但是普遍的观点是、我们首先需要意识到的一点是：汽车工业的整体经济形势。”“当人问我能否保证未来5年奔驰依旧效忠F1，这是不可能有的承诺。更重要的在于，我们是否能否找到一套规则，限制也好、预算帽也好，如果是可能的，那就能带来帮助。”“这需要FOTA和FIA联手共同协商，需要大家都把它放在心上，这是非常严肃的现实问题，绝不容许有丝毫的懈怠、敷衍塞责。现在的问题是不是讨论扩散器、用不用KERS的，所有参赛者应该考虑重要的事。”豪格接着说道。(行云)	豪格,罗伯特-豪格,HelmutLense,诺伯特-豪格	正向	"Haug denied that Mercedes would withdraw from F1 in the future, and the future rules would decide the fate of the Mercedes star. Mercedes F1 team manager Robert Haug refuted the rumor and denied that Mercedes would withdraw from F1 due to the ""perjury door"" incident of McLaren. This week, the German media Stuttgarter-Zeitung analyzed in an interview with Helmut Lense, a member of the Daimler supervisory board, that due to the gloomy situation of the global automotive industry and the possible further punishment of McLaren for the ""perjury"" incident, Mercedes is under pressure. Mercedes, which holds 40% of the McLaren team, may withdraw from F1. Today in Bahrain, Norbert Haug, the three-pointed star’s car boss, denied it. Some people hinted that Mercedes would withdraw from F1. NO, Mercedes will not withdraw. ""Haag said to Auto Motor und Sport in Bahrain on Friday."" But the Germans do acknowledge that the current industrial situation does make the participation of car manufacturers in the race uncertain. Of course, every honest person is considering the current situation, which is a fact. Our sponsorship behavior does indeed always exist with uncertainty. I can't predict what will happen in the automotive industry in the next two, three, four, or five months, and I can't predict whether the industry situation will improve. But if you sell more cars, your situation will definitely be better. ""Haag analyzed,"" he said. He then pointed out that the decision of whether Mercedes would remain loyal to F1 in the long term was not the ""perjury"" incident that people were discussing, but what kind of rules F1 would have in the next few years, especially the issue of whether F1 would introduce a budget cap. As it stands, everything is as usual. The media's understanding is that as long as you face the FIA hearing, they will think that your future is in doubt. But the general view is that the first thing we need to be aware of is the overall economic situation of the automotive industry. It is impossible to make a commitment that Mercedes will remain loyal to F1 in the next five years when people ask me. More importantly, can we find a set of rules, whether caps or budget ceilings, that, if possible, would be helpful. This requires the FOTA and FIA to work together and negotiate, and everyone needs to take it seriously. This is a very serious and real problem, and there must be no negligence or shirking of responsibility. Is it now about the diffuser and whether or not to use KERS? All the teams should consider the important things. Haug continued. (Traveling Cloud)"

At around 6:45 am on November 12, Li and Tang drove to the entrance of a bank on Zhongshan South Road. When Xiaojie was passing by on his way to school, Tang first pretended to ask the way and chatted with him, and then sprayed anesthetic spray on his face. Then Li came up with a knife to force Xiaojie into the car. The two people blindfolded Xiao Jie's eyes with a black cloth prepared in advance, tied his hands and feet with tape, and put him in the trunk of the car to take him away from Shanghai. Then the two people called to extort RMB 10 million from Xiao Jie's parents as ransom, threatening to kill him. After the police received the report, they immediately launched an investigation. After locking down the location of the suspect, they launched a swift operation. After 12 hours, they successfully rescued the hostage and apprehended Kong Mou and two others in Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province.

Based on the development of the annual report season in recent years, except for the fact that there was no annual report season during the launch of the share reform in early 2005, there has been annual report season hype every year, usually starting in early to mid-January and ending in early April. Yesterday, a fund researcher told the reporter that the annual report performance of this year would not be as spectacular as that of last year, but would be a stock performance. Private equity investor Wu Guoping said that a wave of phase strengthening may appear in February and March when the annual report is concentratedly disclosed. As for how high we can go, we dare not be too optimistic. Part of the stock price adjustment is not sufficient, and special attention or avoidance is needed for these varieties.

小学教师强奸猥亵多名女童被执行死刑中新网南阳9月16日电(吴扬曹萌张庆江)今天下午，河南南阳市中级人民法院遵照最高人民法院院长签发的执行死刑命令，依法将当地强奸、猥亵儿童的小学教师刘翔宇验明正身，押赴刑场执行死刑。据调查，2008年上学期及2009年下学期，刘翔宇利用担任南阳市宛城区红泥湾镇某小学班主任之便，在教室分别对多名6—9岁的女学生进行奸淫、猥亵，甚至在上课期间多次将女生叫到讲台上进行猥亵。2010年7月5日，南阳市中级人民法院一审认定被告人刘翔宇犯强奸罪，判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身；犯猥亵儿童罪，判处有期徒刑十三年，决定执行死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。刘翔宇不服，提出上诉。河南省高级人民法院经过二审，裁定驳回上诉，维持原判，并提请最高人民法院核准。最高人民法院经复核认为，被告人刘翔宇利用教师身份，多次在教室等公共场所对多名幼女进行奸淫，并致一人重伤，罪行极其严重，应依法从重处罚。一审判决，二审裁定准确适当，遂核准河南省高级人民法院对被告人刘翔宇作出的维持一审判决的刑事裁定。刘翔宇强奸、猥亵儿童案曾备受社会各界关注，网友将其评论为“最不要脸的老师”“禽兽老师”。	吴扬,曹萌,张庆江,刘翔宇	负向	"A primary school teacher who raped and molested multiple girls was executed in Nanyang, Henan province. WU Yang, CAO Meng, ZHANG Qingjiang, September 16, 2021, Nanyang, Henan province (China News Network) - In the afternoon of today, the Intermediate People's Court of Nanyang City, Henan Province, carried out the death penalty in accordance with the execution order signed by the President of the Supreme People's Court, and lawfully verified the identity of Liu Xiangyu, a primary school teacher who raped and molested children, and transported him to the execution ground for the death penalty. According to the investigation, in the first semester of 2008 and the second semester of 2009, Liu Xiangyu, taking advantage of his position as a homeroom teacher at a primary school in the Hongniwan Town of Wancun District, Nanyang City, raped and molested several girls aged 6-9 in the classroom, and even molested girls on the podium during class time on multiple occasions. On July 5, 2010, the Intermediate People's Court of Nanyang City ruled that the defendant Liu Xiangyu was guilty of rape and sentenced to death, deprivation of political rights for life; guilty of molesting children and sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment, and decided to execute the death penalty, deprivation of political rights for life.  Liu Xiangyu was不服不服 means dissatisfaction or disagreement, but it's not a proper term in English. I will translate it as ""disagreed"" or ""was dissatisfied"". So, the sentence would be: Liu Xiangyu disagreed, and appealed. The Henan Provincial Higher People's Court, after the second trial, ruled to dismiss the appeal, uphold the original judgment, and submit it to the Supreme People's Court for approval. After the Supreme People's Court reviewed the case, it found that defendant Liu Xiangyu, taking advantage of his teacher's identity, repeatedly raped multiple young girls in public places such as classrooms, causing one of them to suffer serious injuries, and the crime was extremely serious. He should be punished more severely according to the law. The first-instance judgment and the second-instance ruling were accurate and appropriate, and the Supreme People's Court approved the criminal ruling of the Henan Provincial Higher People's Court to uphold the first-instance judgment against the defendant Liu Xiangyu. Liu Xiangyu, who was accused of rape and molestation of children, was once widely concerned by all sectors of society, and netizens commented that he was the ""most shameless teacher"" and ""beastly teacher""."
托雷斯放言愿破利物浦球门他切尔西战袍1天狂售2万件新浪体育讯　冬季转会窗关闭当天，切尔西给托雷斯开出的5000万英镑报价终于被利物浦接受，很快切尔西官方就宣布西班牙前锋正式加盟球队。这出由球员本人在似乎毫无征兆的情况下，递交转会申请而引发的转会肥皂剧终于尘埃落定。事后《每日邮报》披露，托雷斯本人早在去年就萌生了离开球队的想法。托雷斯本人透露：“在去年夏天，我就在思考是不是得离开了，因为我希望自己的职业生涯能更进一步，以实现自己作为职业球员的抱负。切尔西这样的球队，每个赛季都能去角逐各个锦标，特别是英超冠军和欧冠的冠军，当这样的球队希望你加盟时，你不可能去拒绝。“对于他的抱负理想，很多利物浦球迷就不是那么买账了。在托雷斯转会的消息确认之后，部分激进的利物浦球迷甚至选择焚烧他的9号球衣来示威。不久之后利物浦将在主场迎战切尔西，至于在比赛中球迷们将会给托雷斯怎样的待遇，就不得而知了。面对愤怒的利物浦球迷，托雷斯这样说：“和我当初从马德里竞技转投利物浦一样，就好像天命，我只是遵循它所以选择离开。我从来没有也绝不会说任何利物浦的坏话，现在我为切尔西效力了，我定当为球队竭尽全力。”托雷斯还表示，自己迫切希望在接下来对阵利物浦的比赛中能够登场亮相，而且能够在这场比赛中取得进球，不过他将不会庆祝，以示对前东家的尊重。谈到自己即将在切尔西开始的新生活，托雷斯谈到：“我无疑是来到了一个伟大的集体之中——特里，兰帕德，德罗巴，他们一个个全都是响当当的大人物，我相信自己也会成为他们中的一分子。我会努力做好工作，认真训练，不断进球，融入到集体中。在此我还要感谢切尔西俱乐部，因为这让我拥有了更上一层楼的机会。”此外，前利物浦队友贝纳永也会帮助托雷斯尽快的与新队友们打成一片。“我和贝纳永以前就是很好的朋友，能再和他一起踢球我十分高兴，我希望他能尽快从伤病中恢复过来，同样我也很期待和新朋友们的见面。”几乎在他加盟球队的同时，切尔西球迷商店就立即推出了印有托雷斯名字的9号队服，50英镑一件的球服甚至在官方最终确认转会之前就卖出了2万多件。他的到来，无疑已经在切尔西球迷中掀起了一股托雷斯浪潮，无数球迷为他的加盟而欣喜若狂。对于新援，主帅安切洛蒂也有话要说：“我迫不及待地想要立马见到他们，他们的到来对于球队是梦幻般的事件。”一前一后两员大将的加盟，使得意大利人手里的牌更好了，究竟切尔西能不能在最后阶段奋起直追，夺下英超冠军的奖杯，我们拭目以待。(阿韦多)	托雷斯,特里,兰帕德,德罗巴,贝纳永,安切洛蒂,阿韦多	正向	"Torres said he was willing to break the Liverpool goal in his Chelsea jersey, and 20,000 pieces of Chelsea were sold in one day. On the day the winter transfer window closed, Chelsea's offer of 50 million pounds to Torres was finally accepted by Liverpool, and soon Chelsea's official announced that the Spanish forward had officially joined the team. This transfer soap opera, triggered by the player himself submitting a transfer application seemingly out of the blue, has finally come to an end. Afterwards, The Daily Mail revealed that Torres himself had already had the idea to leave the team last year. Torres himself revealed that last summer he was thinking about leaving, as he wanted to take his career to the next level and realize his aspirations as a professional player. Chelsea, a team that competes for all the trophies every season, especially the Premier League and the Champions League, when such a team wants you to join, you can't refuse. Many Liverpool fans are not so enthusiastic about his ambitions and ideals. After Torres' transfer was confirmed, some radical Liverpool fans even chose to burn his No. 9 shirt to protest. Liverpool will play Chelsea at home soon, and it is unknown how the fans will treat Torre in the match. Faced with the angry Liverpool fans, Torres said, ""Just like when I transferred from Atletico Madrid to Liverpool, it was like fate, and I just followed it and chose to leave."" I have never said anything bad about Liverpool and I will never say anything bad about them. Now that I play for Chelsea, I will do my best for the team. Torres also said that he was eager to play in the next match against Liverpool and score a goal, but he would not celebrate to show respect for his former club. When it comes to the new life he is about to start at Chelsea, Torres said, ""I have undoubtedly joined a great team – Terry, Lampard, Drogba, they are all big shots, and I believe I will also be one of them."" I will work hard to do a good job, train seriously, score more goals, and integrate into the team. I also want to thank Chelsea FC for giving me the opportunity to take the next step. In addition, Benayoun, who used to play for Liverpool, will help Torres to quickly integrate with his new teammates. I was a good friend with Benayoun before, and I am very happy to play with him again. I hope he can recover from his injury as soon as possible. I am also looking forward to meeting my new friends. Almost at the same time as his signing, Chelsea's fan shop immediately launched a jersey with Torres' name on the No.9 shirt, and more than 20,000 jerseys were sold at 50 pounds each even before the official confirmation of the transfer. His arrival has certainly sparked a Torres craze among Chelsea fans, with countless fans rejoicing at his signing. For the new signings, the head coach Ancelotti also has something to say: ""I can't wait to meet them right away, their arrival is a dreamlike event for the team."" The arrival of two leading players one after another has made the Italian hand better. Whether Chelsea can catch up in the final stage and win the Premier League trophy, we will have to wait and see.

曼联中场一大弱点成为命门若非意外和运气红魔靠什么记者寒冰评述利物浦没有杰拉德，曼联没有弗莱彻，两个中场的缺失让比赛的天平发生了微妙变化。贝尼特斯和弗格森各自都是不变应万变，吉格斯出现在左路负责串联前场，但因为利物浦的中场抢球能力过于强大，整个上半场吉格斯几乎没有几次致命的直传。托雷斯和技术出众的贝纳永主攻右路，曼联的攻势也从吉格斯一侧转移到瓦伦西亚的右翼。不过，因为缺少了吉格斯的发挥，鲁尼和贝尔巴托夫在前场几乎哑火，这也是整个上半场曼联居然只有2脚射门的根本原因。利物浦的问题同样在于库伊特无法替代杰拉德，右路的贝纳永突破和传中都有特点，但在托雷斯已拉开空当的前提下，库伊特把握机会能力非常一般。于是更多情况下，托雷斯甚至开始尝试在边路突破带球，但中路没有接应的痼疾让红军没有实质性的威胁。下半场曼联在攻势上的乏术愈加凸显，助攻能力差的奥谢死守后场，而一味突入底线传中的瓦伦西亚有勇无谋。双后腰的效果方面，马斯切拉诺和卢卡斯的组合远胜卡里克和斯科尔斯，吉格斯得球机会少，也就无法向锋线提供帮助。第65分钟，曼联为自己在进攻上的无能付出了必然的代价，费迪南德和维迪奇的组合在速度上根本无法与托雷斯竞争，托雷斯的进球只是时间问题。曼联在控球时间上略多，但真正能在禁区内找到空间的传球寥寥。相反，贝纳永在杰拉德缺席下的作用，是几乎镜像位置的吉格斯无法比拟的。10分钟后，弗格森拿出了自己的战术变化：欧文出场与鲁尼搭档强调速度，纳尼换下斯科尔斯代替吉格斯拉边，吉格斯则回到中路串联攻防。吉格斯个人技术突出，尤其是纳尼在左路的突破很有效果。体能下降的红军终于遇到了真正的问题，贝尼特斯此时只是用高大的锋线小将恩戈格换下带伤上阵体能不佳的托雷斯。弗格森孤注一掷的前场5人组进攻搭档，给主动收缩防守的利物浦制造了极大的麻烦。不过，显然贝尼特斯安排贝纳永和库伊特，在反击中的优势远大于曼联。最后时刻的20分钟里，面对红军摆出的铁桶阵，曼联在进攻上的想象力匮乏让他们付出了最惨重的代价。维迪奇和马斯切拉诺的红牌，并没有影响两支球队的战术布置。至于最后时刻恩戈格的进球，缺少了维迪奇的曼联根本无法阻挡。至少在安菲尔德，贝尼特斯的451在中场建立的强大优势，让弗格森本就缺乏想象力的攻击线无从下口。没有C·罗纳尔多的曼联，的确非常不同。假若没有“弗格森时间”和运气的照顾，曼联根本走不到如今的排名。	杰拉德,弗莱彻,贝尼特斯,弗格森,吉格斯,托雷斯,贝纳永,瓦伦西亚,鲁尼,贝尔巴托夫,库伊特,奥谢,马斯切拉诺,卢卡斯,卡里克,斯科尔斯,费迪南德,维迪奇,欧文,纳尼,恩戈格,罗纳尔多	正向	"One of Manchester United's major weaknesses in the midfield has become a fatal flaw if not for accidents and luck, how can the Red Devils rely on it? Commentator Cold Ice: Liverpool has no Gerrard, Manchester United has no Fletcher, the absence of two midfielders has caused a subtle change in the balance of the game. Benitez and Ferguson are both versatile, Giggs appears on the left to link up the front, but because Liverpool's midfield is too strong in ball recovery, Giggs hardly made a few deadly through balls in the first half. Torres and Benayoun, who are technically excellent, attack on the right, and Manchester United's attack also shifts from Giggs to Valencia's right wing. But because of the lack of Giggs' performance, Rooney and Berbatov were almost silent in the front, which was the fundamental reason why Manchester United only had 2 shots in the first half. Liverpool's problem is that Kuyt cannot replace Gerrard, Benayoun has his own characteristics in breaking and crossing on the right, but Kuyt's ability to seize opportunities is very ordinary under the premise that Torres has opened up the space. So Torres even began to try to break through and dribble on the wing more often, but the old problem of no support in the middle left the Reds with no real threat. In the second half, Manchester United's lack of offensive ability was even more obvious, with O'Shea, who was poor at assisting, defending at the back, and Valencia, who was brave but not wise, rushing to the byline to cross. In terms of the double pivot, Mascherano and Lucas are far superior to Carrick and Scholes, and Giggs has fewer opportunities to receive the ball, so he can no longer provide assistance to the front line. In the 65th minute, Manchester United paid the inevitable price for their inability to attack, Ferdinand and Vidic's combination could not compete with Torres in terms of speed, and Torres's goal was only a matter of time. Man United had a slight edge in possession, but there were few passes that found space in the box. On the contrary, Benayoun’s role when Gerrard is absent is almost incomparable to that of Giggs, who occupies a mirror position. In 10 minutes, Ferguson made his tactical changes: Owen came on to play with Rooney to emphasize speed, Nani replaced Scholes to play on the wing, while Giggs returned to the middle to link up attack and defense. Giggs has outstanding personal skills, especially Nani's breakthrough on the left is very effective. The physically exhausted Reds finally encountered a real problem, and Benitez replaced the injured and tired Torres with the tall forward youngster Enogge. Ferguson’s five-man front line, who staked everything on the attack, caused Liverpool, who were playing a more defensive game, a great deal of trouble. But clearly Benitez had Benayoun and Kuyt on for the counter-attack, and they had a distinct advantage over Manchester United. In the last 20 minutes of the game, Manchester United paid the heaviest price for their lack of attacking imagination in the face of Liverpool’s solid defense. Vidic and Mascherano's red cards did not affect the tactical setup of the two teams. As for Engoge's goal in the final moments, Manchester United, without Vidic, could not stop it. At least at Anfield, Benitez’s 451 set up a strong midfield advantage that made Ferguson’s already unimaginative attack irrelevant. Without Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United is indeed very different. Without ""Ferguson Time"" and a bit of luck, Manchester United would not have reached its current ranking."

And Zhang Hanyu's version of Song Jiang was also praised by netizens as the most realistic one, not only in terms of heroic temperament, but also in terms of the air of a commoner. In the latest set of photos, the golden line on the forehead of Zhang Hanyu is faintly visible, and it fully expresses Song Jiang's martial and literary spirit. Both tough and gentle, with a strong and imposing demeanor. From the time the news of his participation in the new version of ""Water Margin"" was released to the hot shooting of the TV series, the ""flower scarf"" incident received criticism from netizens, but for Zhang Hanyu's ""Song Jiang"", netizens gave him consistent praise. The production team also recognized Zhang Han Yu as the only choice to play Song Jiang from the beginning. Sina Entertainment conducted an exclusive interview with the production team of the new ""Water Margin"", and they said: ""Zhang Han Yu himself has the ruggedness of Liangshan heroes, and also has a unique literary and elegant temperament, which is also his charm."" In the most recent episode of ""Dongping"", Zhang Hanyu's pose with a book in hand also brings out Song Jiang's unique identity and momentum. “Song Jiang is very real” In the new version of Water Margin, Song Jiang is played by Zhang Hanyu, and from the costume photos, his appearance is very close to the original. Zhang Hanyu's superb acting naturally does not need to be worried, but it is reported that Zhang Hanyu, who is known for his tough image, wants to play Song Jiang as a hero. Li Zonghan, who has many on-screen duels with Zhang Hanyu, said that Zhang Hanyu's appearance is exactly the same as Song Jiang in his mind. The appearance is very close to the original. At a glance, he is not Zhang Hanyu, he is Song Jiang. Since I joined the crew, I have had the most scenes with Huanyu. We watched the footage together in many film sets, and at that moment, I saw a particularly real and very human Song Jiang. In terms of Hanyu's acting, Song Jiang he played has his own personal characteristics."
地量未必地价欧美隐忧恐拖累A股《红周刊》特约作者民族证券徐一钉本周五，A股市场成交量为1051亿元，再创本轮调整的地量。地量以后是地价？未必！6月20日，A股市场成交1101亿元，创出本轮调整的地量，虽然出现2610点至2826点或8.27%的反弹，但随后上证综指又创出2437点的新低。温家宝总理日前表示：经济放缓没超预期，宏观调控取向不能变。透视出很多机构所期待的货币政策结构性微调可能延后，资金不足依然是制约A股强力反弹的最主要因素之一。今年上半年，沪深两市2244家上市公司共实现营业收入10.13万亿元，同比增长25.78%；实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润9943.30亿元，同比增长22.31%。而去年上半年，1947家上市公司实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润7849.89亿元，同比增长41.17%。今年上半年上市公司净利润增长比去年明显放缓。值得关注的是，今年上半年，16家上市银行共实现净利润4610.88亿元，同比增长34.27%，上半年16家银行净利润占2244家上市公司净利润的46.37%。如果剔除银行，余下的2228家上市公司实现净利润5332.42%，同比仅增长13.56%。显然，16家银行出色的业绩掩盖了余下的2228家上市公司净利润大幅下滑。上半年，上市公司毛利率降1.3个百分点，主要原因是通胀加剧以及信贷环境紧缩导致的原材料、人力、融资等综合成本上升，正在大幅侵蚀上市公司的利润率。笔者预计，三季度上市公司净利润同比增长还将继续下滑。花旗银行最新报告指出，全球经济，特别是发达国家经济前景持续明显恶化。美银美林模型计算显示，根据最近费城联储和密西根大学的调查数据，美国经济衰退的概率已经超过80%，欧元区制造业采购经理人指数PMI从7月的50.4跌至8月份的49。其中，德国8月PMI由52跌至50.9，为2009年9月以来最低水平。而欧元区17个国家中，仅有德国、荷兰和奥地利三个国家仍保持在50以上，这是欧洲经济失去动力的又一迹象。值得关注的是，面对不佳的经济复苏前景，经济减速已取代通胀成为新兴市场主要的隐忧，部分新兴经济体货币政策已出现悄然松动，巴西央行本周三将基准利率下调0.5个百分点至12%。如果没有预期外的利好或利淡因素，沪市将维持在2500点～2600点区域弱平衡整理。虽然A股估值处于较低水平，沪深股市下跌动能似乎不足。笔者担忧，美国经济、或欧洲主权债务危机再起波澜，若此将打破目前多空弱平衡的格局。	徐一钉,温家宝	正向	The volume may not be a sign of the price of land in Europe and America, and the worries may drag down the A-share market. This week, the A-share market trading volume was 1051 billion yuan, setting a new record for the lowest trading volume in this round of adjustment. After the volume of transactions, is it the land price? Not necessarily! On June 20, the A-share market traded 110.1 billion yuan, setting a new low volume of this round of adjustment, although a rebound from 2,610 points to 2,826 points or 8.27% appeared, the Shanghai Composite Index then set a new low of 2,437 points. Premier Wen Jiabao recently said that the economic slowdown was not beyond expectations, and the orientation of macro-control could not be changed. It may take a while for monetary policy to be structurally fine-tuned as many institutions expect, and funding shortages remain one of the main factors constraining a strong rebound in the A-share market. In the first half of this year, a total of 2,244 listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges achieved a total operating revenue of 10.13 trillion yuan, up 25.78% year-on-year, and realized a net profit attributable to the shareholders of listed companies of 994.33 billion yuan, up 22.31% year-on-year. In the first half of last year, 1,947 listed companies achieved a net profit attributable to the shareholders of listed companies of 784.989 billion yuan, up 41.17% year-on-year. Net profits of listed companies in the first half of this year grew much more slowly than last year. Notably, in the first half of this year, 16 listed banks achieved a net profit of 461.088 billion yuan, up 34.27% year-on-year, and the net profit of the 16 banks in the first half of the year accounted for 46.37% of the net profit of 2,244 listed companies. If excluding banks, the remaining 2,228 listed companies achieved a net profit of 533.24%, with a year-on-year increase of only 13.56%. Clearly, the excellent performance of 16 banks has masked the sharp decline in net profits of the remaining 2,228 listed companies. In the first half of the year, the gross profit margin of listed companies fell by 1.3 percentage points, mainly due to the rising inflation and the rising comprehensive costs of raw materials, labor, financing, etc. caused by the tightening credit environment, which is eroding the profit margin of listed companies to a large extent. The author expects that the year-on-year growth of listed companies' net profit in the third quarter will continue to decline. The latest report from Citibank points out that the global economy, especially that of developed countries, is continuing to deteriorate significantly. The BofA Merrill Lynch model calculations show that the probability of an economic recession in the United States has exceeded 80% according to the latest surveys from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve and the University of Michigan, and the eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell from 50.4 in July to 49 in August. Among them, Germany's PMI in August fell to 50.9 from 52, the lowest level since September 2009. And among the 17 countries in the eurozone, only Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria remain above 50, another sign that the European economy is losing momentum. It is worth noting that, in the face of a poor economic recovery, economic deceleration has replaced inflation as the main concern for emerging markets, and some emerging economies have quietly eased their monetary policies. The central bank of Brazil cut the benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 12% this Wednesday. If there are no unexpected favorable or unfavorable factors, the Shanghai market will maintain a weak equilibrium consolidation in the area of 2500-2600 points. Although A-share valuations are at low levels, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets seem to lack the impetus for a decline. I am concerned that the US economy or the European sovereign debt crisis may flare up again, which would break the current weak equilibrium between bulls and bears.
美股评论：内线人士在抄底导读：虽然股市被日本的麻烦搅得心神不安，但是在上周，企业内线人士卖出股票的速度却突然减缓到了只有前一周的一半。投资通讯专家、MarketWatch专栏作家赫伯特(MarkHulbert)指出，这实际上是意味着内线人士恢复了信心，将混乱当作了入场的机会。以下即赫伯特的评论文章全文：原本看上去，市场似乎很快就要在内线人士股票抛售的压力之下遭受重创了，可就在这当口，内线人士们却撤退了。要知道，这样的事情，他们最近两年之间可干了远不止一次了，因此观察家们也就难免感到迷惑：他们是在和我们闹着玩么？具体的层面，我们先来了解一下内线人士在上周日本危机当中的反应。根据那些内线人士行为研究专家的看法，如果他们继续按照之前那样的速度出售自己公司的股票，就意味着一个超级不祥之兆已经出现在市场的眼前。所谓不祥之兆是指，这意味着他们对于自己公司股票价格在短期之内复原几乎没有什么信心。好在，他们事实上并没有那样做。想要了解真实的情况，我们可以参考一个内线人士上周售出与买进自己公司股票的比率——ArgusResearch发行的VickersWeeklyInsiderReport每周都会发布这一比率的最新版本。周一的最新一期通讯显示，内线人士售出买进比率上周大大降低，只有前一周的一半左右。根据Vickers提供的数据，这已经是比率去年9月以来的最低水平。InsiderInsights投资通讯编辑莫兰德(JonathanMoreland)对这一明显变化的解释是：“内线人士将过去一周的混乱看作是一个机会，他们抄底买进了。”去年的9月，即这一比率上一次如此之低的时候，道琼斯工业平均指数的点位大约是1万500点以下，较之现在低了近2000点。看涨者发现内线人士在市场前进了这么大一步之后还是类似的姿态，当然会非常高兴。《赫伯特金融摘要》所追踪的以内线人士行为为线索的投资通讯，在这一周都选择了增持。那么，他们建议自己的客户买进哪些股票？Vickers推荐了无线服务提供商USAMobility(USMO)。莫兰德推荐了三支股票，其中两支都是医药类股：LigandPharmaceuticals(LGND)和ThresholdPharmaceuticals(THLD)。莫兰德的第三个推荐是UraniumResources(URRE)。他表示，这是个“让人极度紧张的”选择，因为该股在日本核危机期间价格暴跌。不过，如果你想要追踪内线人士的做法，那么你的策略就不可能不让人紧张，因为和所有的逆势分析策略一样，这一策略往往都会要我们买进那些不被多数人看好的股票。(子衿)	赫伯特,Argus,Vickers,莫兰德,子衿	正向	US stock market commentary: insiders are buying back stocks: although the stock market was disturbed by Japan's troubles, the speed at which corporate insiders sold stocks last week suddenly slowed to half of the previous week. Mark Hulbert, an investment newsletter expert and MarketWatch columnist, notes that this actually means that insiders have regained confidence and are using the chaos as an opportunity to enter the market. The following is the full text of Herbert's commentary: It seemed that the market was about to suffer a heavy blow under the pressure of insider stock sales, but at this moment, insiders withdrew. To know that such things have been going on for more than a couple of years, and to wonder whether they are just playing with us. At the specific level, let us first understand the response of the insiders during the Japanese crisis last week. According to the view of insiders' behavior research experts, if they continue to sell the stocks of their own company at the previous speed, it means that a super ominous sign has appeared in the market. An omen of ill omen means that they have almost no confidence that the stock price of their company will recover in the short term. Fortunately, they did not do that in fact. To understand the real situation, we can refer to the ratio of insiders buying and selling their own company's stock last week - the latest version of the VickersWeeklyInsiderReport published by ArgusResearch, which provides this ratio. The latest edition of the Monday newsletter shows that the insider buy-sell ratio last week was greatly reduced, only about half of the previous week. According to the data provided by Vickers, this is the lowest ratio since September last year. Jonathan Moreland, the editor of Insider Insights investment newsletter, explained the obvious change as follows: insiders saw the chaos of the past week as an opportunity to buy at the bottom. Last September, when this ratio was last this low, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading at around 15,000 points, nearly 2,000 points lower than it is now. The bulls, finding the insiders had made such a big step forward in the market, of course would be very happy in a similar posture. The investment newsletters tracked by Herbert Financial Digest all chose to increase their positions this week, based on insider behavior. So, what stocks do they recommend to their clients to buy? Vickers recommended the wireless service provider USAMobility (USMO). Moran recommended three stocks, two of which were pharmaceutical stocks: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and Threshold Pharmaceuticals (THLD). Mollander's third recommendation is UraniumResources(URRE). He said it was an “extremely nerve-wracking” choice, given the stock’s price plunge during Japan’s nuclear crisis. But if you want to follow the approach of the insider, your strategy will inevitably be a nervous one, because, like all contrarian analysis strategies, it will often require you to buy stocks that most people do not like.

The college entrance examination will begin on June 7, and the examination affairs will be arranged by the district and county today. According to the regulations, the examination room will initiate the handling method for accidental events in the college entrance examination when there are 20 situations such as mixed examination papers, unclear printing of examination papers, and candidates cheating. The teacher particularly reminds that the foreign language test must arrive 15 minutes in advance. The college entrance examination regulations stipulate that if a candidate forgets to bring or loses their admission ticket, the invigilator may first verify the candidate's appearance. If it matches the photo on the admission ticket stub, the invigilator may allow the candidate to enter the examination room for the exam and require the candidate to bring the admission ticket for the next exam. In addition, the invigilator should record the questions answered in advance by the examinee before the examination signal is given or the questions answered after the examination signal is given in the ""Record of Violating Candidates"". If the examinee experiences a faint or illness, and there are more than 30 minutes left before the end of the exam, the examinee should be isolated for treatment. The teacher reminded the candidates to pay special attention to the entry time for each exam. 20 minutes before the exam (30 minutes before the Chinese exam), candidates may enter the examination room with their admission cards and other relevant documents. It is especially important to note that foreign language tests include listening tests. To avoid affecting other candidates, candidates who are late for the foreign language subject are required to enter the examination room 15 minutes before the start of the exam, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the examination room.

亚太松下公开赛首日比赛因天气取消比赛减至54洞新浪体育讯　北京时间9月23日消息，由于受到恶劣天气的影响，亚巡赛与日巡赛共同认可的亚太松下公开赛第一轮比赛被迫取消，本来四轮72洞的比赛因此压缩至三天(周五至周日)54洞比赛。总奖金约为170万美元的亚太松下公开赛本来今天早上在日本神户兵库县六甲国际高尔夫俱乐部东球场(RokkoKokusaiGolfClubEastCourse)开打。可是，在球手们打了25分钟后，赛事的裁判因为大风大雨的天气吹响了汽笛，在7点25分暂停比赛。随着风雨相加的势头没有减弱，赛事的裁判随后在10点取消了当天的比赛，表示本届赛事将会缩减至54洞。这样，第一轮比赛将于周五举行，依旧按照之前的开球时间进行。在周六打完36洞之后，比赛将产生晋级决赛的球手，然后在周日举行最后一轮的比赛。按照天气预报，兵库县在随后几天的天气将会放晴。亚巡赛赛事主管JittisakTamprasert说：“在审议之后，赛事组委会决定取消第一天的比赛，因为这样的状况无法举行比赛。亚太松下公开赛现在将进行三轮比赛，第一轮比赛将在周五早上重新开始。”这是亚巡赛连续第二周因为天气影响将比赛缩减至54洞。上周，在宝岛台湾林口国际高尔夫俱乐部举行的亚巡赛新赛事--仰德TPC高尔夫球公开赛因为在周日遭遇台风天气的影响，不得不同样将比赛缩减至54洞。本届亚太松下公开赛吸引了众多亚巡赛和日巡赛高手参赛，包括了2007年亚巡赛奖金王梁文冲、目前领先亚巡赛奖金榜的19岁韩国小将卢乘烈以及上赛季日巡赛奖金王石川辽。他们都是本周的夺冠热门人选，其中中国名将梁文冲在去年的亚太松下公开赛上获得了并列第2名，只输给了冠军丸山大辅(DaisukeMaruyama)。另外，来自福建的吴阿顺则第一次参加亚太松下公开赛。(罗毅)	JittisakTamprasert,林口,仰德,梁文冲,卢乘烈,石川辽,丸山大辅,吴阿顺,罗毅	正向	The first round of the Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open, co-sanctioned by the Asian and Japan Tours, was canceled due to bad weather, and the four-round 72-hole competition was compressed to a 54-hole competition from Friday to Sunday. The Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open, with a total prize money of about $1.7 million, was originally scheduled to start this morning at the East Course of the RokkoKokusaiGolfClub in Hyogo Prefecture, Kobe, Japan. But after 25 minutes of play, the referee blew the whistle to suspend play at 7:25 p.m. due to the heavy wind and rain. As the rain continued to fall, the tournament officials canceled the day's play at 10 a.m., and announced that the tournament would be shortened to 54 holes. In this way, the first round of the competition will be held on Friday, with the kick-off time still as before. After 36 holes on Saturday, the players who qualify for the final round will be determined, and the final round will be held on Sunday. According to the weather forecast, Hyogo Prefecture will be sunny in the following days. Jittisak Tamprasert, the managing director of the Asian Tour, said that after deliberation, the tournament committee decided to cancel the first day's play because the situation was not conducive to holding the tournament. The Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open will now have three rounds of competition, and the first round will be restarted in the morning of Friday. This is the second week in a row that the Asia Tour has had to cut the tournament to 54 holes due to weather. Last week, the new Asian Tour event, the Yunda TPC Golf Open, held at the LinKou International Golf Club in Taiwan, had to be shortened to 54 holes due to the impact of typhoon weather on Sunday. The 2008 Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open attracted a number of top players from the Asian and Japan Tours, including Liang Wen-chung, the 2007 Asian Tour money leader, 19-year-old Korean star Ryu Tae-yeol, who leads the Asian Tour money list at present, and Higa Ryo, the 2007 Japan Tour money leader. They are all the favorites to win this week, with Chinese veteran Liang Wenchong finishing tied for second in the 2016 Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open, losing only to champion Daisuke Maruyama. Also, Wu Aishun from Fujian Province made his debut at the APAC Panasonic Open. (Lu Yi)
即将挑战前期高点关注两会机会昨天，两市开盘后小幅震荡上扬，在地产、银行等权重板块的推动下，盘中最高一度越过2930点，逼近2月中旬及去年12月中旬的两波反弹高点。但终因市场缺乏领导力的领涨板块无功而返，最终以带上影线的小阳线报收，成交量亦出现明显放大，K线形态呈现冲高回落态势。总体来看，由于缺乏主流领涨热点，市场短期大幅上攻尚缺乏人气支持，后期仍以温和震荡为主。从盘中来看，前期领涨的高铁、重装、水利等品种无疑开始进入了震荡整理阶段，退潮迹象非常明显。而农业、水泥等板块则表现参差不齐，联动性较差，石墨烯更是曲高和寡，也很难调动起市场的人气。市场中已经形成各自为战的比较混乱的局面，绝大部分个股的走势取决于指数的波动。指数涨，则个股涨，指数跌，则个股跌。所以对于大多数投资者而言，目前尚无法判断明确的可中线操作的热点，只能采取耐心等待的策略。从外围环境来看，对市场有利因素较多。一方面，考虑到“两会”即将召开，市场会维持一个稳定运行的环境，大落的可能性不大。另一方面，国家重拳整治楼市的政策滞后效应开始逐渐显现，通胀压力相应得以缓解，货币政策对市场的威胁会有所减弱。当然，也有不利因素，典型的莫过于目前市场资金面仍然显得并不充裕，而即使通胀有所缓解，短期内资金面也不会有所改观。另外，国家对于提高直接融资比重的定调，多少会让人联想起主板市场的再度大规模扩容。综合起来看，外围环境对市场短期内维持稳定还是多少会提供一定的支持，而且“两会”期间可能出现的一些政策性利好，多少也会对市场构成一定刺激，造成局部热点的活跃。从技术上来看，市场在一个上有压力下有支撑的区域中运行。2950点上方压力明显，要想向上突破，需要主流领涨热点及成交量的配合；2700点下方支撑强劲，在无重大外部环境负面影响下轻易不会跌破。估计近期这种横向震荡局面仍会延续，以等待中线突破方向的明朗。从操作上来看，在大的突破方向明朗前，最为稳妥的操作策略是以逸待劳，需找那些近期涨幅不大、基本面没有问题的品种小仓位参与，等待反弹补涨机会，一旦出现一定涨幅，也要及时获利出局。对于受到突发性政策因素刺激而出现的短线热点，需要结合市场情况，亦需见好就收。和讯信息崔晓黎■观点组合●金证顾问盘中宽幅震荡利于消化压力昨日市场延续强势格局，继四连阳后，上证综指继续向前期高点英勇推进，盘中最高上摸至2931点，基本到达前期高点附近，深证成指走势更强，收盘已突破近期高点，并创出自去年11月12日以来的收盘新高，两市成交继续温和梯度放大，价升量增预示着增量资金正在逐步入场，利于后市股指继续走好。昨日下午盘中，股指出现剧烈波动，上证综指在攻至前期高点附近时出现连续跳水，但回落至2900点整数关口附近再获支撑回升。我们认为，前期股指在2920点附近连续震荡达6个交易日，积累了一定的套牢盘压力，股指在此位置出现震荡整理是合情合理的，而略带恐慌性的跳水，有利于清洗短线不稳定的获利盘筹码，有利于后市股指继续向上攻击。同时，这也从一个侧面反映出目前主力资金意在长远。●东海证券即将挑战前期高点昨日公布的经济先行指标PMI为52.2%，环比回落0.7个百分点，这也是连续第三个月回落，显示经济环比增速下滑，但我们认为，进入3月份之后，经济基本面将出现相对好转。首先，1月份新增贷款反弹，显示企业潜在投资需求较旺。我们认为随着货币供应量增速反弹，企业投资需求将显现。其次，房地产投资面临好转，我国有史以来最大规模保障性安居工程已经全面启动，这将极大弥补商品房投资下降的缺口。从昨日公布业绩的保利地产等地产股来看，动态市盈率将迅速下降到10倍以下，地产股的反弹动力已经日益强劲。再次，海外经济持续复苏。近期欧美经济先行指标显示海外经济复苏正在继续，虽然中东局势导致油价大涨，但目前并不会对世界经济复苏产生太大的负面影响，且目前中东局势已有趋于明朗的迹象。不出意外，近期紧张的国际局势即将缓解，外围市场已经开始持续回升，这些都将刺激A股随之反弹。预计近几个交易日市场将维持盘升格局，并择机向上突破前期高点2939点和2944点的压制。●北京股商震荡攀升更关注机会昨日大盘震荡上行，午后在银行板块冲高之后，出现快速跳水，尾盘在两油的推动下，股指收复了部分失地。从盘面上看，主力做局的痕迹较为明显，近期几次快速下杀，都伴随着成交量的瞬时放大，而后又有资金奋起接盘，推动股指继续向好。但昨日尾盘向上挑的主要动力来自权重股，再结合早盘部分资金出现净流出状态，说明部分涨幅较大的个股出现获利盘集中兑现的动作。因此，虽然后市中线趋势依然看好，但短期内板块分化的趋势会得到强化。我们认为，只要盘中出现能够赚钱的机会，就不应该成为操作的障碍，而且中线行情看好，出现大的系统性风险概率较小，激进的投资者可在新材料、水泥、农业等板块中寻找机会，稳健的投资者可继续控制仓位，等待明确的市场热点出现。	崔晓黎	正向	"Prepare to challenge the early high point and pay attention to the opportunities of the two sessions. Yesterday, the two markets fluctuated slightly after opening, and reached as high as 2930 points during the trading process, approaching the two peaks of the two rebounds in mid-February and late December last year, with the support of heavyweights such as real estate and banks. But in the end, the market failed to rise due to the lack of a leading sector, and closed with a small bullish candle with an upper shadow, and the volume also showed a significant increase. The K-line pattern showed a pattern of rising and falling. Overall, due to the lack of mainstream leading hotspots, the market lacks the support of人气to make a sharp upward attack in the short term, and it is still mainly温和oscillation in the later period. From the plate, the leading high-speed rail, heavy industry, water conservancy and other varieties in the early stage have undoubtedly entered the stage of oscillation and consolidation, and the signs of ebb and flow are very obvious. And the agricultural, cement, and other sectors have shown uneven performance, with poor coordination, and graphene is even too highbrow for the masses, making it difficult to stir up market enthusiasm. The market has formed a chaotic situation with each player fighting for themselves, and the majority of individual stocks' trends depend on the fluctuations of the index. When the index rises, individual stocks rise, and when the index falls, individual stocks fall. So for most investors, there is currently no clear hot spot for medium-term operations, and they can only adopt a strategy of patient waiting. From the external environment, there are many favorable factors for the market. On the one hand, given that the “two sessions” are about to be held, the market is likely to maintain a stable operating environment, and a large drop is unlikely. On the other hand, the lag effect of the country's tough measures to regulate the real estate market is gradually becoming apparent, and the inflationary pressure is correspondingly relieved, and the threat of monetary policy to the market will be somewhat reduced. Of course, there are also negative factors, the most typical of which is that the market liquidity is still not sufficient at present, and even if inflation eases, the liquidity will not improve in the short term. Moreover, the country’s tone for increasing the proportion of direct financing would remind people of the large-scale expansion of the main board market. Taken together, the external environment will provide some support for the market to maintain stability in the short term, and some policy benefits that may occur during the ""two sessions"" will also stimulate the market to some extent, causing some local hotspots to be active. Technically, the market is operating in a range with upward pressure and downward support. There is a clear upward pressure at 2950 points, and a breakthrough upward requires the cooperation of mainstream leading hotspots and trading volume; the support at 2700 points is strong and will not easily break through without major negative external environmental impacts. It is estimated that this lateral oscillation pattern will continue in the near term to wait for the clarity of the breakout direction of the medium-term. Operationally, before the direction of a major breakthrough is clear, the most stable operational strategy is to wait and see, and to participate in those varieties with small gains in recent periods and no problems in fundamentals with a small position, waiting for the opportunity to rebound and catch up. Once a certain gain appears, it is also necessary to exit with profits in time. For short-term hotspots triggered by sudden policy factors, it is necessary to combine market conditions and also to cash in when the opportunity arises. For Xin Huan Information Cui Xiaoli, the combination of views, the large fluctuation of the golden certificate advisor during the day is conducive to the digestion of pressure. Yesterday's market continued the strong pattern, after four consecutive days of growth, the Shenzhen Composite Index continued to advance courageously towards the previous high point, the highest price during the day reached 2931 points, basically reaching the previous high point, the Shenzhen Composite Index was stronger, closed above the recent high point, and created a new closing high since November 12, 2011. The two markets' trading volume continued to increase in a gentle gradient, the price increased and the volume increased, indicating that the incremental funds were gradually entering the market, which was conducive to the continued improvement of the stock index in the future. In the afternoon trading session of yesterday, the stock index showed violent fluctuations, and the SSE Composite Index experienced a continuous plunge when it approached the previous high point, but it regained support and rose again near the 2900-point integer level. We believe that the stock index has accumulated a certain amount of pressure of being trapped at around 2920 points for six consecutive trading days, and it is reasonable for the stock index to show a fluctuation and consolidation at this position. A slightly panic-driven plunge is beneficial for cleaning up the short-term unstable profit-taking shares, which is conducive to the stock index continuing to attack upward in the future. Meanwhile, this also reflects, to some extent, that the main players are looking to the long term. ● Donghai Securities is about to challenge the previous high point. The economic leading indicator PMI released yesterday was 52.2%, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, which is also the third consecutive month of decline, indicating a slowdown in the ring ratio of economic growth. However, we believe that the basic economic situation will show relative improvement after March. First, the increase in new loans in January rebounded, indicating strong potential investment demand from enterprises. We believe that corporate investment demand will emerge as the growth rate of money supply rebounds. Second, real estate investment is expected to improve, as the largest-ever housing security program in China has been fully launched, which will significantly make up for the shortfall caused by the decline in residential investment. Based on the performance of Poly Real Estate and other real estate stocks that have announced their performance in the past, the dynamic P/E ratio will quickly fall below 10 times, and the rebound momentum of real estate stocks is becoming increasingly strong. Second, the overseas economy continued to recover. Recent leading indicators of the economies of Europe and America show that the overseas economic recovery is continuing. Although the Middle East situation has led to a sharp rise in oil prices, it will not have a significant negative impact on the world economic recovery at present, and there are signs that the Middle East situation is becoming clearer. As expected, the tense international situation is expected to ease in the near future, and the peripheral markets have already started to rise continuously, which will stimulate the A-share market to rebound accordingly. It is expected that the market will maintain an upward trend in the next few trading days and break through the previous highs of 2939 points and 2944 points. ● Beijing stock traders rose and climbed more focused on opportunities. Yesterday, the major market fluctuated and rose. In the afternoon, after the banking sector rose sharply, it quickly dived. At the end of the day, the stock index recovered some of the lost ground under the impetus of the two oils. From the chart, the traces of the main players setting the trap are quite obvious. In recent several quick drops, the trading volume has been instantly enlarged, and then the funds have risen to take over the positions, pushing the index to continue to improve. But the main driving force for the upward pull at the end of yesterday's trading was the heavyweights, and combined with the fact that some funds flowed out in net terms in the morning, it indicates that there is a concentrated realization of profits for some stocks with large gains. Thus, while the long-term trend of the market remains positive, the trend of sector divergence will be strengthened in the short term. We believe that as long as there are opportunities to make money during the trading day, they should not become obstacles to operations, and since the medium-term market outlook is positive and the probability of large systemic risks is small, aggressive investors can look for opportunities in sectors such as new materials, cement, agriculture, etc., while conservative investors can continue to control their positions and wait for clear market hotspots to appear."
你的房子能值多少钱？佐藤先生家住东京都中野区，已经安家长崎的儿子也无意返回东京。佐藤先生已经72岁，身体每况愈下。近日他奔走于各大银行之间，咨询倒按揭的事。自己的年龄、房地产权归属等条件都符合条件，现在，最关键的是土地和房屋的价值评估问题。40年前以1亿日元买下的这块土地加房屋，怎么也能评估到8000多万日元吧，他想。可是估价结果是4200万日元，佐藤先生不信，连跑4家银行，结果估价额都差不多。房屋和土地的估价是倒按揭中最重要的一环，因为关系到按揭人的可融资额度。在日本，虽然每家银行各自有指定的估价机构，但是主要的估价指标都是相同的，主要包括：土地价、房屋的折旧率、房屋的现价和将来预期价等等。日本多数银行不接受公寓抵押根据2003年数据，在日本，地价同房屋的市值比值是6.9：1。在倒按揭的估价中，地价的占比更高，多数说法是对房屋的估价接近0，这也是多数银行不接受用公寓抵押来做倒按揭的主要原因，虽然银行没有在明文中规定不接受公寓的倒按揭，但在实际的操作中，一般公寓是会被拒绝的。在历史中，极少数被接受倒按揭的高档公寓的评估价值也是非常低，同购买价是不可比的。其实，日本的公寓产权中是含有小面积土地的，只是因为面积太小，在倒按揭的估价中的价值占比还是太小，起不到保值的作用。可贷款的额度还要再打折扣，一般是估价额的70%左右。因此，金融机构一般只挑估价额在5000万日元有的甚至要求是1亿日元以上的不动产才做的。对于倒按揭的申请人，过去银行的规定是限于55岁以上，但是随着日本的人均寿命的延长，现在多数银行把年龄界限设置在60岁以上，甚至还有的产品要求申请人是在65、75岁以上。房屋产权的归属要求是贷款人本人或者夫妇是唯一产权所有者，在签订倒按揭合同的同时，申请人会被要求签署遗嘱，明确产权将在贷款期满之后归属于放贷机构。在中国推广倒按揭的难点在中国，倒按揭的推广还有许多课题需要研究。同日本的房产相比较，中国的房产有很多不同之处，比如中国的房屋不包含土地、使用权是有年限的、房屋的平均使用寿命较短、房价一直处于快速涨价通道等。中国房屋的平均寿命是多长呢？有数据称，新建筑的平均使用寿命尚不足30年。可见，在给这样的房屋估价时，不确定的变量太多，房屋的估价存在难度，因此需要建立科学的估价模型，它要能在最大限度上平衡贷款方和放贷方的双方的利益和风险。此外，估价标准、估价的执行机构的选择、对于抵押物的约束条件(诸如建筑年限、保养程度等)、贷款利息的约定(在日本一般采用浮动利率)、贷款人的贷款期限预测等等操作层面的技术性问题，也是在推行倒按揭的过程中需要解决好的一些问题。政府应扮演什么角色？那么，倒按揭的操作方应该是谁呢？银行、保险公司加上政府。银行和保险公司是执行者不错，但是从日本和美国的实际操作历史来看，政府必须扮演推动者的角色。在日本，倒按揭的放贷方主体分成政府机构和民间机构两种。地方政府提供的倒按揭服务包括：地方政府直接提供融资、地方政府协调通过民间金融机构融资、通过地方社会福利协会融资、通过地方住宅公积金融资四种主要的方式。在日本，政府主要为不动产的估价在5000万日元以下的贷款者融资，来帮助金融机构不愿做的中低端客户。日本公寓约占总住宅数的10%，预计有0.8兆亿日元的市场，还有待于开发。因为属于中低端的市场，估计还是需要政府来主导推动公寓倒按揭市场的开发。在美国，联邦住宅局(FHA)的保险机关为倒按揭提供保险服务，在直接关系到贷款人利益的“不动产估价”这一关键点上，FHA对评估机构直接实行指导和教育的权力。这对于贷款人是极大的保障，也能有效减少后期纠纷，并促进倒按揭的推广。倒按揭在日本的推广虽然艰难而漫长，但是它利国利民的作用已经被社会认可。据推算如果有20000名高龄者使用倒按揭，可以为日本减少政府支出100亿日元。祝愿倒按揭也能早日惠及中国的老年朋友们。(作者为日本养老产业专家、皇家庄园管理公司执行董事)我要评论	佐藤	正向	"How much is your house worth? Mr. Sato lives in Nakano, Tokyo, and his son who has already settled in Nagasaki has no intention of returning to Tokyo. Mr. Sato is already 72 years old and his health is deteriorating. Recently, he has been running around the banks to consult about reverse mortgage. Your age, property rights, and other conditions all meet the requirements. Now, the key issue is the valuation of the land and the house. The land with the house, which he had bought for one hundred million yen forty years ago, should be appraised at more than eighty million yen, he thought. But the valuation was 42 million yen, and Mr. Sato did not believe it, so he ran to four banks in a row, and the valuation was about the same. The valuation of the house and the land is the most important part of reverse mortgage, because it is related to the mortgagee's financing quota. In Japan, although each bank has its own designated appraisal agency, the main appraisal indicators are the same, including land price, depreciation rate of houses, current price of houses, and expected future price, etc. Most Japanese banks do not accept apartments as collateral. According to data from 2003, the ratio of land prices to the market value of houses in Japan was 6.9:1. In reverse mortgages, the proportion of land prices is higher, and most people say that the valuation of the house is close to 0, which is also the main reason why most banks do not accept apartments as collateral for reverse mortgages, although banks have not explicitly stipulated that they do not accept reverse mortgages with apartments, in actual operation, apartments are generally refused. In history, the appraised value of a few high-end apartments that were accepted for reverse mortgages was also very low and was not comparable to the purchase price. Actually, the apartment in Japan does contain a small piece of land, but because the area is too small, the proportion of its value in the reverse mortgage valuation is still too small to play a role in preserving value. The amount that can be loaned is usually discounted to about 70% of the appraised value. Thus, financial institutions generally only deal with real estate with an appraised value of 50 million yen or more, and some even require it to be over 100 million yen. For reverse mortgage applicants, banks used to limit the age to 55 or above, but with the extension of the average life expectancy in Japan, most banks now set the age limit at 60 or above, and some products even require applicants to be 65 or 75 or above. The ownership of the property is required to be the loan applicant or the couple as the only property owner. At the same time as signing the reverse mortgage contract, the applicant will be required to sign a will to clarify that the property will belong to the lending institution after the loan period. Promoting reverse mortgages in China is difficult, and there are still many issues to be studied in promoting reverse mortgages in China. Compared with the properties in Japan, there are many differences in the properties in China, such as the houses in China do not include land, the right to use has a time limit, the average service life of the house is shorter, and the house price has been in a rapid price increase channel. What is the average lifespan of a house in China? Data show that the average lifespan of new buildings is less than 30 years. Thus, when valuing such a house, there are too many uncertain variables, and it is difficult to value the house. Therefore, a scientific valuation model needs to be established, which can balance the interests and risks of both the lending and borrowing parties to the greatest extent. In addition, technical issues such as the valuation standard, the selection of the valuation agency, the constraints on the mortgaged property (such as the age of the building and the level of maintenance), the agreement on the loan interest rate (floating interest rate is generally adopted in Japan), and the prediction of the loan term of the borrower, etc., are also some of the issues that need to be resolved well during the promotion of reverse mortgage. What role should the government play? Then, who should be the operator of reverse mortgage? Banks, insurance companies, plus the government. The banks and insurance companies are good executors, but from the actual operation history of Japan and the United States, the government must play the role of a promoter. In Japan, the lending parties of reverse mortgages are divided into government institutions and private institutions. The main ways of reverse mortgage services provided by local governments include: local governments directly providing financing, local governments coordinating financing through private financial institutions, financing through local social welfare associations, and financing through local housing provident funds. In Japan, the government finances loans for borrowers whose property valuation is below 50 million yen, to help financial institutions serve the middle and lower-end customers that they are unwilling to serve. Japanese apartments account for about 10% of total housing, and there is a market of 800 billion yen that is yet to be developed. Because it is a mid-to-low-end market, it is still estimated that the government will need to take the lead in promoting the development of the reverse mortgage market for apartments. In the United States, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an insurance agency, provides insurance services for reverse mortgages, and has the power to directly guide and educate the appraisal agencies on the key point of ""real estate valuation"" directly related to the interests of the lender. This is a great guarantee for the lender, can effectively reduce disputes later, and promote the promotion of reverse mortgage. Reverse mortgages have been difficult and long to promote in Japan, but their benefits to the country and its people have been recognized by society. It is estimated that if 20,000 elderly people use reverse mortgages, it can reduce the Japanese government's expenditure by 10 billion yen. May reverse mortgage soon benefit the elderly friends in China as well. (The author is an expert in the Japanese elderly care industry and a director of the Royal Manor Management Company.) I would like to comment."
穆迪：亚太地区主权信用评级稳定向好摘要：穆迪发布报告称，亚太地区21个主权信用评级总体仍保持稳定乃至积极走向。中国和其他新兴市场国家在2010年上半年引领了全球经济复苏。汇通网1月31日讯——穆迪投资者服务公司(Moody'sInvestorsService)周一(31日)召开新闻发布会，发布了《亚太地区主权评级年中展望》报告，称亚太地区21个主权信用评级总体仍保持稳定乃至积极走向。穆迪亚洲和中东地区主权信用风险业务分析师拜恩(ThomasByrne)表示，亚太地区主权信用评级并没有因此次全球金融危机而遭降，未来12个月，该地区多数主权信用基本面仍可能保持稳固。2010年年初以来，穆迪上调了韩国主权信用评级以及印度本币信用评级，将印尼评级前景从稳定调制积极，泰国和越南评级前景依旧为负面。拜恩指出：“中国经济强劲增长帮助铸就了区域经济的V型复苏，中国大陆对地区出口的强劲需求成为关键推动力。该地区多数国家经济产出已经完全恢复至危机前水平，中国和其他新兴市场国家在2010年上半年引领了全球经济复苏。”他还表示：“从总体上看，亚太地区经济以及评级前景面临的风险可控，我们相信，即便全球金融市场进一步发生动荡，该地区21个主权信用评级也会展示出强大的适应性。”穆迪维持日本Aa2评级的稳定前景不变，但同时表示该国容易遭受全球经济增长或者出口需求放缓的打击。此外，一旦巩固预算以及恢复经济增长的政策失效，日本评级前景就会面临下行压力。穆迪还表示，若中国以及发达经济体经济增速放缓，亚太地区增长速度也将随之下降，发达经济体经济增长面临的不确定性也可能影响该地区未来几年的增长强度。	穆迪,拜恩,ThomasByrne	正向	"Moody's: Summary of Sovereign Credit Rating in Asia-Pacific Region: Moody's has released a report stating that the overall sovereign credit ratings in the Asia-Pacific region have remained stable and even positive. China and other emerging market countries led the global economic recovery in the first half of 2010. On January 31, the Moody's Investors Service held a press conference and released the ""Mid-Year Outlook for Sovereign Ratings in the Asia-Pacific Region"" report, stating that the overall sovereign credit ratings in the Asia-Pacific region remained stable and even positive. Moody's sovereign credit risk analyst for Asia and the Middle East, Thomas Byrne, said that the sovereign credit ratings in the Asia-Pacific region have not been downgraded as a result of the global financial crisis, and that the fundamentals of most sovereign credit in the region are likely to remain stable over the next 12 months. Since the beginning of 2010, Moody's has upgraded South Korea's sovereign credit rating and India's local currency credit rating, and adjusted Indonesia's rating outlook from stable to positive, while Thailand and Vietnam's rating outlook remains negative. Bain noted that China’s strong economic growth helped to shape a V-shaped recovery in the region, with strong demand for exports from mainland China serving as a key driver. Most countries in the region have recovered fully to their pre-crisis levels of economic output, and China and other emerging market countries led the global economic recovery in the first half of 2010. He also said that, overall, the risks to the economic outlook and ratings in the Asia-Pacific region are manageable, and we believe that the 21 sovereign credit ratings in the region will demonstrate strong adaptability even if the global financial markets experience further turmoil. Moody's has maintained the stable outlook for Japan's Aa2 rating, but at the same time, it has stated that the country is vulnerable to a slowdown in global economic growth or export demand. Moreover, Japan’s rating outlook would face downward pressure if policies to consolidate the budget and restore economic growth were to fail. Moody also noted that if China and advanced economies slow down, the growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region will also decline, and the uncertainty facing the growth of advanced economies may also affect the growth intensity of the region in the coming years."
苹果再诉宏达电侵犯其两项专利权连环诉讼再现比特网(ChinaByte)6月24日消息，据国外媒体报道，苹果本周再向美国特拉华州地区法院提起诉讼，称宏达电(HTC)侵犯了该公司的另两项专利。根据法庭文件，苹果在本次诉讼中提到了四项专利。但是其中两项已经包含于此前的诉讼中。苹果在本次诉讼中新增的两项专利为：-6282646：随显示配置改变而实时调整的系统和-7380116：随显示配置改变而实时调整的系统。今年3月初，苹果对宏达电提起诉讼，称宏达电侵犯了苹果与iPhone图形界面、架构及硬件相关的20项专利。美国国际贸易委员会目前仍在调查苹果对宏达电的侵权申诉。在上次诉讼尚无定论的情况下，苹果再次发难，显然是继续施压。目前，两家公司都向美国国际贸易委员会起诉对方，要求禁止进口另一家公司的产品。业内人士分析，许多关注国外市场的中国公司都知道，在国外的竞争中，诉讼尤其是专利诉讼是相当常见的。苹果公司对台湾HTC公司提起的专利诉讼是一个大型科技公司试图防止一个新崛起的竞争对手分割现有市场的实例。HTC是一家智能手机制造商，2009年该公司率先在其生产的手机上运行谷歌Android操作系统。不久后，HTC又开始制造谷歌广泛推广的Nexus智能手机。2010年初，HTC推出了一款新智能手机(Legend)，其设计看起来很像最初的iPhone。因此，在智能手机制造商中，HTC被看做是苹果最有威胁性的竞争对手之一。据悉，截至2010年6月9日，HTC只有100多个专利(不包括正在购买和争取许可的)。这个数字大大低于其他主要手机制造公司。而同一数据库显示苹果有3000多项专利，更不要提其数量庞大的专利申请了。所以，苹果的战略手段是通过打击竞争对手中最薄弱的环节来阻止或至少减慢对手侵占自己市场的速度。		正向	Apple Sues HTC for Patent Infringement, Continues the Ring of Lawsuits ChinaByte, June 24, 2008 - According to foreign media reports, Apple has filed a lawsuit against HTC in the Delaware District Court this week, claiming that HTC has infringed on two of its patents. According to the court documents, Apple mentioned four patents in this lawsuit. But two of them were already included in the earlier litigation. The two patents that Apple added to this lawsuit are: -6282646: System that adjusts in real time with changes in display configuration, and -7380116: System that adjusts in real time with changes in display configuration. In early March of this year, Apple sued HTC, claiming that HTC had infringed on 20 of Apple's patents related to the iPhone's graphical user interface, architecture, and hardware. The U.S. International Trade Commission is still investigating Apple’s infringement complaint against HTC. In the absence of a definitive ruling in the previous lawsuit, Apple’s renewed attack is clearly an attempt to exert more pressure. Currently, both companies have sued each other in the US International Trade Commission, requesting a ban on the import of the other company's products. Industry insiders say that many Chinese companies that focus on the overseas market know that litigation, especially patent litigation, is quite common in foreign competition. Apple's lawsuit against HTC, a Taiwanese company, is an example of a large tech company trying to prevent a rising competitor from carving up an existing market. HTC is a smartphone manufacturer, and in 2009, the company ran the Google Android operating system on the phones it produced first. Soon, HTC began manufacturing the Nexus smartphones, which Google widely promoted. In early 2010, HTC launched a new smartphone (Legend), whose design looked very much like the original iPhone. Thus, HTC is regarded as one of Apple’s most threatening competitors among smartphone manufacturers. As of June 9, 2010, it is reported that HTC had only about 100 patents (excluding those being purchased and licensed). This figure is much lower than that of other major mobile phone manufacturers. And the same database shows that Apple has over 3,000 patents, not to mention the large number of patent applications. So, Apple’s strategy is to attack the weakest link of its competitors in order to prevent or at least slow down the pace at which competitors are encroaching on its market.
女大学生跨省为病友筹款微博悼念称来生再见《湖南女大学生赴粤为先心病友筹款》续“三军哥，来生再见”信息时报讯(记者何剑辉)信息时报曾在本月20日报道湖南女大学生胡双赴粤为先心病友筹款一事。前日晚上8时许，患有先天性心脏病的23岁小伙崔三军在广东省人民医院抢救无效病逝。胡双昨日再一次来到广州，给崔三军送行，并在微博留言“三军哥，来生再见”。闻三军去世双妹急赴穗昨日上午6时58分，人在湖南的胡双哭着给记者打来电话：“崔大叔说，三军哥昨天晚上去世了。我不敢相信，前几天他才转出ICU病房的。”上午10时，胡双的姐姐给记者来电说，“胡双已经登上了前往广州的高铁，她身体不好，麻烦您接一下她”。下午1时许，胡双到达广州，因本身也患有先心病的原因，哭得双眼通红的她更显得十分虚弱。在乘坐地铁前往广东省人民医院的途中，她不断地对记者说，“前几天我离开广州时，医生说三军哥起码能坚持一个月。上海一位明星一直关注三军哥的病情，还说过段时间就能请到最好的医生让三军哥去上海治疗……他怎么会走得这么突然……”三军未签协议无法捐遗体下午2时30分，到省人民医院后，胡双直奔到崔三军生前住的病房，护士安慰她说，“昨晚被送到4楼的ICU病房抢救，小伙曾已经去世了。别哭，赶紧去问问看能否和他再见一面”。胡双随后碰到了正处理崔三军后事的崔三军父亲。崔大叔看到胡双哭红了的双眼，也不禁哭了起来，“埋怨”胡双说，“你过来干什么，这不又浪费钱吗”。胡双说，“大叔，这个时候还谈什么钱，我还能见三军哥一面吗？”但当崔三军父亲办理完手续后，带着胡双进入了医院的车库，运载崔三军遗体的车已开走前往殡仪馆了。胡双告诉记者，她特意从长沙赶来广州，一个目的就是希望能帮崔三军实现捐献遗体的愿望。胡双说，“在广州深圳住院期间，三军哥也曾多次对我说要捐献遗体的事。他是希望能对社会做出贡献，并且希望有人能关心他60多岁的老父亲和智障的哥哥。”可惜，因为崔三军生前并没有真正签订捐献遗体的协议，其遗体只能火化处理。胡双说，“医生说，三军哥没有签订协议。另外时间过得太长了，遗体捐献是要在死亡后两小时内进行各项保护工作。三军哥的遗体只能火化，他唯一的遗愿无法实现了。”双妹奔波劳累入院吸氧昨日下午6时许，忙碌12小时后，疲惫的胡双陪同崔三军父亲回到住宿的地方。胡双说，“我感觉自己有点喘不过起来。”为防万一，胡双在安顿好崔三军父亲后，自己前往医院做检查。由于下午有些劳累，医生要求她吸氧恢复一下。今日，胡双将陪同崔大叔到殡仪馆为三军送行。在确认崔三军逝世后，胡双抽空在新浪微博“先心病崔三军的呼唤”上，写下这样一句话，“天堂不会有贫穷，不会有病魔……那里又多了一个顽强小子，三军哥，今生只能做你小妹了，‘来生再见’”。事件回顾两名病友的真情故事崔三军，是河南舞阳人，7岁时被查出患有先心病，由于家境贫寒，中专休学来广东打工，去年春病情逐渐严重，家人与他开始四处求医。去年8月，崔三军注册名为“极度号唤”的新浪微博求援，记录治病经历，并曾表示“愿捐献身体帮助他人”。胡双是湖南中医药大学学生，也是一名先心病患者，与崔三军在网上求医过程中认识后，积极帮助崔三军筹款治疗，并注册了“先心病崔三军的呼唤”的新浪微博进行筹款。胡双的善行得到了不少网友的支持和捐款。	三军哥,三军,胡双,崔三军,崔大叔	正向	"A female college student from Hunan province has been fundraising for a congenital heart disease patient in Guangdong province. She wrote a tweet to mourn her friend, saying ""see you in the next life"". Information Times (Reporter He Jianhui) The Information Times reported on the 20th of this month that a female college student from Hunan province, Hu Shuang, went to Guangdong to raise funds for a congenital heart disease patient. At around 8 p.m. the previous evening, Cui Sijun, a 23-year-old man with congenital heart disease, died after unsuccessful resuscitation at the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. Hu Shuang came to Guangzhou again yesterday to see off Cui Sanjun, and left a message on Weibo, ""Brother Sanjun, see you in the next life."" Upon learning of Comrade Sanjun's passing, the two sisters rushed to Guangzhou early in the morning. At 6:58 am yesterday, Hu Shuang, who was in Hunan, called the journalist in tears, saying, ""Auntie Cuile said that Comrade Sanjun passed away last night."" I can't believe it, he was just transferred out of the ICU a few days ago. At 10 a.m., Hu Shuang's sister called the journalist to say, ""Hu Shuang has already boarded the high-speed train to Guangzhou. She is not well, and it would be a bother if you could pick her up."" At 1 p.m., Hu Shuang arrived in Guangzhou. Because she also suffers from congenital heart disease, she looked even more weak and red-eyed. During the trip to Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital by subway, she kept telling the reporter, ""The doctor said that Sanjunguo could at least last a month when I left Guangzhou a few days ago."" A celebrity in Shanghai has been concerned about San Junge's condition and said that he could invite the best doctor to Shanghai for treatment in a few days. How could he suddenly die so suddenly? San Jun did not sign an agreement to donate his body. At 2:30 PM, after arriving at the provincial people's hospital, Hu Shuang rushed to the ward where San Jun lived before. The nurse comforted her, saying that the young man had already died after being sent to the ICU ward on the 4th floor for rescue last night. Don't cry, go and ask if you can see him again. Hu Shuang then ran into Cui Sanjun’s father, who was handling Cui Sanjun’s funeral. Uncle Cui, seeing Hu Shuang’s red eyes, couldn’t help crying, “Complaining” to Hu Shuang, “Why did you come over? This is just wasting money again.” Hu Shuang said, ""Uncle, what are you talking about money at this time? Can I still see Brother Sanjun?"" But after Mr. Cui Sijun’s father finished the procedures, he took Hu Shuang to the hospital’s garage. The vehicle that carried Cui Sijun’s body had already left for the morgue. Hu Shuang told the reporter that she specially came from Changsha to Guangzhou, one of the purposes was to help Cui Sanjun realize the wish of donating his body. Hu Shuang said, ""During his hospitalization in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Sanjun哥also told me many times that he wanted to donate his body after death."" He hopes to make contributions to society and that someone will care about his father, who is over 60 years old, and his mentally disabled brother. Unfortunately, because Cui Sanjun did not actually sign a donation agreement for his body before his death, his body can only be cremated. Hu Shuang said, ""The doctor said that Sanjun哥 had not signed a contract."" And the time has passed, the body donation should be done within two hours after death for all protective measures. Only cremation was possible for Sanguan Ge's body, and his only wish could not be fulfilled. ""Double Sister was tired after running around and was admitted to the hospital for oxygen inhalation. Yesterday afternoon at 6 o'clock, after a busy 12 hours, Hu Shuang accompanied Cui Sanjun's father back to the place of accommodation."" Hu Shuang said, ""I feel a bit short of breath."" In order to be on the safe side, Hu Shuang went to the hospital for a check-up after settling Cui Sanjun’s father. Because she was a little tired in the afternoon, the doctor asked her to inhale oxygen to recover. Today, Hu Shuang will accompany Uncle Cui to the funeral home to see off the three armies. After confirming that Cui Sanjun had passed away, Hu Shuang took the time to write a sentence on Sina Weibo ""Cui Sanjun's Cry for Congenital Heart Disease"": ""There is no poverty and no disease in heaven... Another strong boy has been added there. Brother Sanjun, I can only be your little sister in this life. 'See you in the next life'."" Event review The true story of two patients. Cui Sanjun is from Wuyang, Henan. He was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at the age of 7. Due to his poor family background, he dropped out of vocational school and came to Guangdong to work. Last spring, his condition gradually worsened, and his family and he began to seek medical treatment all over the place. In August last year, Cui Sijun registered a Sina Weibo account named ""Extremely Cry"" to seek help, recorded his medical experience, and once said that he was willing to donate his body to help others. Hu Shuang is a student of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine and also a patient with congenital heart disease. After meeting Cui Sanjun online, she actively helped Cui Sanjun raise funds for treatment and registered a Sina Weibo account named ""Cui Sanjun's Call for Congenital Heart Disease"" for fundraising. Hu Shuang’s good deeds have received a lot of support and donations from netizens."

基金：中央汇金入市意义更重大证券时报记者杨磊程满清股市热切期盼的利好政策终于出台，证券交易印花税单边收取和中央汇金公司将购买工中建三大行股票的利好政策同时出台。基金经理们普遍认为，利好政策的及时出台有利于稳定股市投资者的信心，其中，汇金公司入市意义要比单边收取印花税更重要。银行股上涨对股指形成支撑基金经理普遍认为，中央汇金公司出人意料地直接购买三大银行股，此举意义重大，将对股市形成明显的支撑作用。因为银行股在中国股市的权重最大，占到了沪深300指数两成以上的份额，银行股的上涨预期将对股指形成很大的支撑。“单边收取印花税的作用主要体现在心理层面上，毕竟在现阶段的成交水平上，单边收取印花税一年只能节约资金100亿元左右，对资金面直接影响不大。如果投资者对未来股市信心不足，单降低印花税影响有限。”北京一位基金经理表示。回顾今年4月份印花税从千分之三下调到千分之一后股市的表现，一些基金经理对此次印花税单边收取的作用仍然有所担心。有基金经理认为，宏观经济形势和大小非问题依然是影响股市最大的问题，降低印花税的政策只能缓解市场恐慌情绪，如果国际和国内的经济形势进一步下滑，单边印花税的救市效果可能微乎其微。购买三大行股票是共赢深圳一位基金经理表示，汇金公司作为三大行的股东，直接购买三大行的股票本身就可以缓解市场对银行股大小非减持的担忧。而在购买价格上，建行远低于A股IPO价格，中行昨日收盘仍略低于3.08元的IPO价格，只有工行略高于IPO价格，汇金公司以发行价左右甚至低于发行价购买三大行股票，对市场各方来说都是一个共赢的局面。记者采访中了解到，多只基金在沪指跌破2000点大关之后就在逐步加仓。其中一位基金经理表示，2000点以下加仓的投资行为主要是从估值的角度来考虑的，并没有刻意去“赌”利好政策。单边印花税和汇金购买三大行的组合利好出台后，基金将根据市场情况波段操作，从目前情况来看，沪指1800点的阶段底部也已经初步探明。	杨磊,程满清	正向	"The Fund: The significance of Central Huijin's entry into the market is more important. Securities Times reporter Yang Lei Cheng Manqing The market is looking forward to the favorable policy, and the favorable policy of single-side collection of securities transaction stamp duty and Central Huijin will purchase stocks of the three major banks of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Bank of China is issued at the same time. Fund managers generally believe that timely policy support is conducive to stabilizing the confidence of stock market investors, and that the entry of the CSRC is more important than unilaterally levying stamp duty. Bank stocks' rise supports the index, fund managers generally believe that the central Huijin Company's unexpected direct purchase of the three major bank stocks, this move is significant, will form a clear support for the stock market. Because the weight of the banking sector in the Chinese stock market is the largest, accounting for more than 20% of the CSI 300 index, the upward expectation of banking stocks will form a great support for the index. The main role of unilaterally collecting stamp duty lies in the psychological level. After all, with the current transaction level, unilaterally collecting stamp duty can only save about 10 billion yuan in funds annually, which has little direct impact on the liquidity of funds. If investors lack confidence in the stock market in the future, a single reduction in stamp duty will have a limited impact. ""A fund manager in Beijing said. Reviewing the stock market performance after the stamp duty was cut from 0.3% to 0.1% in April this year, some fund managers are still concerned about the effect of one-sided stamp duty collection. Some fund managers believe that the macroeconomic situation and the issue of state-owned and non-state-owned shareholders are still the biggest problems affecting the stock market. The policy of reducing stamp duty can only alleviate market panic. If the international and domestic economic situation continues to decline, the effect of one-sided stamp duty to rescue the market may be negligible. Buying the stocks of the three major banks is a win-win situation, said a fund manager in Shenzhen. As shareholders of the three major banks, the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC) can directly buy the stocks of the three major banks, which can alleviate market concerns about the reduction of N-block shares of bank stocks. And in terms of purchase price, the Construction Bank is much lower than the A-share IPO price, and the Bank of China's closing price yesterday was still slightly lower than the IPO price of 3.08 yuan. Only the Industrial and Commercial Bank is slightly higher than the IPO price. The China Investment Corporation purchases the stocks of the three major banks at or even below the issue price, which is a win-win situation for all parties in the market. Journalists learned from the interview that many funds have been gradually increasing their positions after the Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 2000-point mark. One fund manager said that the decision to increase holdings below 2,000 points was mainly based on valuation considerations, and there was no deliberate attempt to ""gamble"" on favorable policies. After the combination of unilateral stamp duty and the purchase of the three major banks by the Gold Exchange was introduced, the fund will operate in a wave according to the market situation. From the current situation, the phase bottom of the Shangzheng Index at 1800 points has also been basically identified."

Talbots第一财季亏损缩小新浪财经讯北京时间周二晚间消息，服装零售商TalbotsInc(TLB)宣布，第一财季亏损缩小，主要得益于其春季服装的强劲销售。调整后盈利好于预期，该公司因此预计全年调整后盈利将超过市场预期。经历了衰退期间的销售疲软之后，Talbots今年早些时候达成了一项复杂交易，使其得以削减债务，并买断了最大股东——日本零售商Aeon(U.S.A。)Inc的股份。截至5月1日的财季，该公司净亏损从上年同期的2360万美元，合每股44美分，降至440万美元，合每股8美分。扣除重组开支，以及与Aeon交易相关的开支后，该公司当季每股盈利38美分。接受汤森路透调查的分析师平均预期该公司当季每股盈利16美分，分析师预期中一般不包括一次性项目。季度营收增长4%，从上年同期的3.06亿美元增至3.21亿美元，低于分析师平均预期的3.23亿美元。同店销售额、即开业至少一年的店面的销售额增长了2.4%，主要得益于全价销售项目的增加。对于第二财季，Talbots预计调整后每股盈利0-5美分，营收将呈低单位数增长。分析师平均预期该公司第二季每股盈利5美分。Talbots预计全年调整后盈利75-83美分，营收将增长3-5%。分析师平均预期该公司全年每股盈利73美分。		正向	Talbots' first quarter loss narrowed. Talbots Inc. (TLB) announced that its first quarter loss narrowed, mainly due to strong sales of spring clothing. Adjusted earnings were better than expected, and the company expects adjusted earnings for the full year to exceed market expectations. Following the sales slump during the recession, Talbots reached a complex deal earlier this year that allowed it to cut its debt and buy out its largest shareholder, Japanese retailer Aeon (U.S.A. Shares of Inc. For the quarter ended May 1, the company's net loss narrowed to $4.4 million, or 8 cents per share, from $23.6 million, or 44 cents per share, in the year-ago period. After deducting restructuring charges and expenses related to the Aeon transaction, the company earned 38 cents per share for the quarter. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn 16 cents per share for the quarter, and typically do not include one-off items in their earnings expectations. Quarterly revenue grew by 4%, from $306 million in the same period last year to $321 million, below the average analyst expectation of $323 million. Same-store sales, which are sales from stores open at least one year, increased by 2.4%, mainly due to an increase in full-price selling items. For the second quarter, Talbots expects adjusted earnings per share of $0.00 to $0.05, and revenue growth in the low single digits. Analysts are expecting an earnings of five cents per share for the second quarter of the company on average. Talbots expects adjusted earnings of $0.75 to $0.83 per share for the full year, with revenue growth of 3-5%. Analysts are expecting an average of 73 cents per share for the company's full year.
大和首予内地汽车股中性评级新浪财经讯2月25日消息，大和指出，国内乘用车销量在经历2009年同比增长53%?2010年增长33%之后，2011年的增长率将大幅放缓至12%；首予内地汽车股中性评级。大和补充说，2010年的销量在一定程度上得益于政府推出的一次性激励措施和减税政策，而这些措施和政策在2011年都不再继续执行。该行表示，在销量增长率降低的环境中，二三线城市的销量情况将突出。该行称，由于这些城市居民的收入水平较一线城市低，因而像长城汽车(2333.HK)?吉利汽车(0175.HK)和比亚迪(1211.HK)等国产品牌将受益最大。欢迎发表评论我要评论		正向	Daiwa Gives Neutral Rating to Domestic Auto Shares of Mainland ChinaSina Corp.

盛大觊觎四年之后终得华友：整合可能艰难孙冰/北京报道喧嚣多日、剧情在盛大与独立财团之间峰回路f转了几次之后，华友终于如愿地收到了来自盛大的丰厚offer(要约函)。收购对于近几年来一直到处“扫货”的盛大来说不是新闻，而被收购对于连年亏损、待卖许久的华友而言更不是新闻，但是“网游老大”出手收购一家SP和音乐公司，还是会引发业界和大众无数的遐想。觊觎四年6月8日晚，盛大互动娱乐有限公司(下称“盛大”)和华友控股有限公司(下称“华友”)联合发布公告：双方已签署正式协议，同意由盛大的一家全资子公司启动要约收购，以收购华友已发行普通股总数的51%，总收购价约为4620万美元。此收购价与华友前一个交易日(即6月5日)股价相比提供了25%的溢价。51%的收购比例与事先传闻的80%有一定差距，但4620万美元的出价，高于另外一个买家——由欢乐传媒总裁董朝晖牵头组成的独立财团(下称“独立财团”)所开出的4000万美元的出价。此前，该独立财团一直是华友收购传闻的主角，但是华友董事会否决了其收购要约，同时市场传出盛大作为第三方入局，并获华友管理层力邀的消息。“收购华友符合盛大一贯的互动娱乐媒体战略，”盛大公关总监、新闻发言人诸葛辉在接受《中国经济周刊》采访时表示，“盛大一贯的目标是做互动娱乐，我们一直在向这个战略方向努力，收购华友是符合这个战略的，我们也一直都在评估关注类似战略的机会。”但是对于盛大将如何对华友进行整合等信息，诸葛辉表示目前不便透露。“我们尊重华友董事会和管理层过去所做的努力以及为华友未来制定的战略和方向，我相信在盛大的用户、资源和平台的支持下，华友将获得更大的发展。”他说，“但是我们目前只是提出一个意向，还没有正式启动具体的要约收购。这是一个系列程序，我们现在做的是第一步，只是双方签署了这样一个协议。”据记者了解，即使毫无变数，要约收购完成也至少需要20个交易日左右。记者试图联系华友方面，但是相关负责人的电话一直无人接听。华友董事长王秦岱也尚未在媒体面前露面，只是在发给媒体的官方声明中表示：“我们相信华友和盛大拥有共同的愿景成为数码娱乐业的领头人。两家公司在内容、分发平台和用户群方面的互补将为双方的未来发展提供巨大的协同效应。”“对于华友来说，盛大当然是一个更好的选择。”艾瑞咨询分析师赵旭枫告诉《中国经济周刊》，“独立财团能给华友的只是一些资金上的援助，盛大则还能给华友一些资源和帮助，更不用说盛大的出价更高了。”她说。据盛大一位内部人士向《中国经济周刊》透露，其实早在2005年，盛大就与华友进行过收购谈判，而且几乎谈成。但是当时盛大正在忙着收购新浪，手中现金有限，加上有高层有不同意见，所以最终未能成行。“当时华友的股价是现在的三倍左右，现在买便宜了很多。”该人士说。只是一个便宜的壳？盛大为何如此钟情华友，甚至心仪了几年？尽管一直以“网络迪斯尼”为目标并自称为“互动娱乐公司”，但是大众还是会将盛大归入网游公司之列，而且其大部分营收也确实来自于游戏业务。根据盛大2009年第一季度财报显示，盛大一季度总营收为11.07亿元人民币(约1.62亿美元)，其中网络游戏营收为10.62亿元人民币。游戏起家的陈天桥在今天对于游戏的情感似乎有些复杂，他曾试图把盛大的侧重点从网游带向“盒子”(即家庭娱乐战略)，但是却使得盛大业绩大减甚至出现巨亏，之后陈天桥即时调整策略，重回游戏，才有了今天盛大单季营收超10亿人民币的骄人业绩。但是陈天桥和盛大从未放弃做互动娱乐媒体的战略。目前盛大集团旗下拥有盛大游戏、盛大文学、盛大在线三大全资公司以及其它投资公司和业务。“就盛大目前的庞大资产群和日益纵深的业务架构来看，陈天桥需要另外的上市公司来承载一些业务模块，让盛大看起来更像是一个集团，而不仅仅是一个游戏公司。”赵旭枫说。外界猜测颇多的是盛大可能会借壳华友实现盛大文学上市。盛大文学2008年7月组建，整合了此前盛大收购的起点中文网、红袖添香和晋江原创网。目前，盛大文学已占全国原创版权网络文学市场80%的份额，营收已进入亿元级别。而此前的5月25日，盛大宣布旗下子公司盛大游戏已向美国证券交易委员会递交上市申请。因此，盛大文学很有可能也将谋求独立上市。对于买华友就是为了买壳上市的猜测，赵旭枫并不大赞同，“如果仅仅是为了借一个壳上市，对于盛大来说完全没有必要，而且如果仅仅是为了买一个壳，这个壳可能还贵了一点。”她认为，华友作为一家集电信增值服务(SP)、音乐及音乐剧制作、游戏、艺人经纪及新媒体等平台建设于一身的企业，盛大更可能是想借其众多的付费用户、与运营商的良好关系、成熟的团队和丰富的业界资源进入无线领域，争夺3G市场上的机会。“盛大早就收购了专门做手机游戏的数位红公司，起点中文网的付费阅读也可以整合到手机平台上，如果盛大能把华友SP业务以及音乐业务与这些资源整合起来，可能将来会有比较好的发展。”她说。目前，业界都相当看好手机游戏业务，其产业链已经基本成熟。根据艾瑞咨询的调查数据显示，2008年我国手机网游用户已经突破1.5亿，所以有人称手机游戏已经到了“井喷前夜”。特别是今年一季度，靠手机游戏的巨大推动，空中网在连续亏损近3年后首次盈利，实现营收近3000万美元，与历史最高峰值持平，极大了提升了业界对于手机游戏的关注。盛大当然更是没有理由看不到这样的趋势。整合艰难“以前盛大收购一些不大的网游公司都开价上千万美元，一个上市公司5000万都不到真的很便宜。”一位张先生告诉《中国经济周刊》，他是被盛大收购的一家公司的高层。但是“便宜”的华友“消化”起来可能没那么容易。赵旭枫认为盛大要想整合华友“其实挺难的”，因为只是得到一个控股权，要真正去影响、控制这个企业并不容易。根据华友公布的财报，2007年该公司净亏损4200万美元，2008年净亏损1200万美元，而2009年第一季度净亏损为210万美元。赵旭枫认为盛大的进入能否帮华友走出亏损的境地还很难说，“能帮他们多撑一段时间吧。”她认为华友的业务线是比较尴尬的，营利模式还不是非常的明确，业务也有断点，华友SP和手机音乐业务营利都不是很好，“华友业务线的未来大家都看好，但是目前来讲这些都是不赚钱的。”她说。另外一个更大的不确定性和挑战来自于国家的政策和3G的发展前景，“关于3G很多相关政策还没有最终确定，特别是资费，如果还是很贵，那估计这些东西都没戏。”赵旭枫说。“从盛大目前状况来看，还不太具备整合华友的能力。盛大的精力毕竟是有限的，华友的业务对于盛大来说又是陌生的业务。”张先生透露说，“盛大对于旗下这些收购的企业的整合力度其实是非常小的，很多时候就是给一笔钱，至于如何经营、怎样营利还是靠原来的经营者。但是这个公司是盛大的和是自己的，这种投入程度要差很多。”张先生说，“全资买下来都只是放在那边不管，更不要说是入股的。”不过外界的担心从某种角度看似乎并不必要。“此次盛大收购华友是通过二级市场进行的，这51%也都是可流通的股票，完全可以抛掉，只要高于现在买进的价格就不亏。”赵旭枫认为，“对于双方来说，这都不是一次绝对的收购，双方都是有余地、有保留的。”赵旭枫说，“此次收购本质上只是盛大来做华友的大股东，不像全资收购，买下来就要负责，又不能轻易卖掉，做不好就会变成不良资产。”2005年，当很多人看到盛大收购新浪的消息，都觉得陈天桥在“扯淡”，而他也的确无法进入新浪董事会，实现整合新浪资源为盛大所用的美好愿望。但不久之后，他卖掉新浪股票，成功抽身还转手赚了1亿多美元。于是，陈天桥再一次告诉大家，他绝不会是输家。	华友,孙冰,董朝晖,诸葛辉,王秦岱,赵旭枫,陈天桥,张先生	正向	"After four years of anticipation, Huayou finally received a generous offer from Shanda. The integration may be difficult. Sun Bing, Beijing report. After the plot of Huayou, which was full of ups and downs, finally turned several times between Shanda and an independent consortium, Huayou finally received a generous offer from Shanda. Acquisition is not news for Great Wall, which has been ""shopping"" all over the place in recent years, and acquisition is not news for Huayou, which has been losing money for years and has been on the market for a long time, but the acquisition of a SP and a music company by the ""King of Online Games"" will still trigger countless speculations in the industry and the public. On the evening of June 8, 2006, Great Wall Interactive Entertainment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Great Wall"") and Huayou Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Huayou"") jointly issued an announcement: the two parties have signed a formal agreement, and agreed that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Wall will initiate a tender offer to acquire 51% of the total number of ordinary shares issued by Huayou, with a total acquisition price of about US$46.2 million. This acquisition price provides a 25% premium compared to Huayou's stock price on the previous trading day (June 5). The 51% acquisition ratio is somewhat different from the 80% that was rumored before, but the $46.2 million bid is higher than the $40 million bid made by an independent consortium led by Dong Zhaohui, president of Happy Media. Previously, the independent consortium had been the main subject of rumors of Huayou's acquisition, but Huayou's board of directors rejected its acquisition offer, and the market spread rumors that Shanda would join as a third party and be invited by Huayou's management. ""Acquiring Huayou is in line with our long-standing strategy of interactive entertainment media,"" Zhu Jihui, the spokesperson of the public relations department of Dangdang, told China Economic Weekly, ""Our long-term goal is to be in the interactive entertainment business. We have been working towards this strategic direction, and the acquisition of Huayou is in line with this strategy. We have always been evaluating and paying attention to similar strategic opportunities."" But Zhuo Hui did not reveal how Great Wall would integrate Huayou. We respect the efforts that Huayou Board and management have made in the past and the strategy and direction they have set for Huayou's future. I believe that with the support of Grand's users, resources, and platform, Huayou will achieve greater development. He said, ""But we are only putting forward an intention at the moment and have not yet launched a specific tender offer."" This is a series of programs, and what we are doing now is the first step, just that both parties have signed such an agreement. According to relevant reporters, even without any changes, the tender offer would take at least 20 trading days to be completed. Journalists tried to contact Huayou, but the phone of the relevant person in charge was always unanswered. Wang Qin Tai, chairman of Huayou, has not yet appeared in front of the media, but only stated in the official statement sent to the media: ""We believe that Huayou and Suning have a common vision to become the leaders in the digital entertainment industry."" The complementary nature of the two companies in terms of content, distribution platforms, and user base will provide significant synergies for the future development of both parties. For Huayou, Shanda is definitely a better choice. Zha Xufeng, an analyst from iResearch, told China Economic Weekly that an independent consortium could only provide Huayou with some financial aid, while Shanda could provide Huayou with more resources and help, not to mention that Shanda’s bid was higher. She said. According to an insider of Shanda, Shanda had actually negotiated with Huayou for acquisition as early as 2005, and the deal was almost done. But at the time, Shinei was busy acquiring Sina, and it had limited cash. In addition, there were different opinions among the senior executives, so it ultimately failed to go through. Huayou's stock price was three times what it is now at that time, and it is much cheaper to buy now. The person said. Just a cheap shell? Why did Grandview have such a strong preference for Huayou, even for several years? Despite its self-proclaimed identity as an “interactive entertainment company” and its aspirations to be known as the “Internet Disney,” the public still classifies Shanda as a game company, and its revenues are largely derived from its gaming business. According to the first quarter financial report of Shanda in 2009, Shanda's total revenue in the first quarter was 1.107 billion yuan RMB (about 162 million US dollars), of which the revenue of online games was 1.062 billion yuan RMB. Chen Tianqiao, who started his career in games, seems to have a somewhat complex feeling towards games today. He once tried to shift the focus of Shanda from online games to ""boxes"" (i.e., home entertainment strategy), but it led to a significant decline in Shanda's performance and even a huge loss. After that, Chen Tianqiao immediately adjusted his strategy and returned to games, which led to Shanda's impressive revenue of over 1 billion RMB per quarter today. But Chen Tianqiao and Shanda never gave up on their strategy of interactive entertainment media. Currently, the Great Joy Group owns three wholly-owned companies, Great Joy Games, Great Joy Literature, and Great Joy Online, as well as other investment companies and businesses. Given the vast asset base and deepening business structure of盛大at present, Chen Tianqiao needs another listed company to carry some business modules, so that it looks more like a group rather than just a game company. Zhao Xufeng said. There are many speculations that Suning may use Huayou as a backdoor to list Suning Literature. Shanda Literature was established in July 2008, integrating Qidian Chinese Network, Hongxiang Tianshang and Jinjiang Original Network, which Shanda had acquired previously. Currently, Suning Literature has taken up 80% of the market share of original copyright online literature in China, and its revenue has entered the level of hundreds of millions of yuan. On May 25, prior to this,盛大 announced that its subsidiary, Shanda Games, had filed for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. So,盛大文学 is likely to seek an independent listing as well. Zhao Xufeng does not agree much with the speculation that Huayou was bought just to get a shell for listing. For Shanda, there is no need to do so. Moreover, if Huayou was bought just for a shell, the price of the shell might be a little too high. She believes that as a company that integrates telecommunications value-added services (SP), music and musical production, games, artist agency, and new media platform construction, Suning is more likely to want to enter the wireless field with its numerous paying users, good relationship with operators, mature team, and rich industry resources, and compete for opportunities in the 3G market. 盛大 long ago acquired Shudihong, a company that specializes in mobile games, and the paid reading of Qidian Chinese Literature Network can also be integrated into the mobile platform. If Shanda can integrate the SP and music businesses of Huayou with these resources, there may be better development in the future. She said. Currently, the mobile game business is highly regarded by the industry, and its industrial chain has basically matured. According to the data from iResearch, the number of mobile game users in China has exceeded 150 million in 2008, so some people say that mobile games are on the verge of a ""bloom"". In particular, in the first quarter of this year, with the huge promotion of mobile games, Kingsoft Online achieved a profit for the first time in nearly three years, with revenue of nearly $30 million, reaching the historical peak, greatly increasing the industry's attention to mobile games. Of course,盛大 had no reason not to see such a trend. Integration is difficult: Previously, when Great Prosperity acquired some small online game companies, the price was over ten million US dollars, and a listed company was less than 50 million, which was really cheap. Mr. Zhang told China Economic Weekly that he is a senior executive of a company that was acquired by盛大 (Shanda). But “cheap” Huayou may not be so easy to “digest”. Zhao Xufeng believes that it is actually quite difficult for Shanda to integrate Huayou, because it only gets a controlling stake, and it is not easy to really influence and control this company. According to the financial report of Huayou, the company lost $42 million in 2007, $12 million in 2008, and $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2009. Zhao Xufeng thinks it is still hard to say whether盛大's entry can help Hua You out of the loss, ""It can help them to last for a longer time."" She thinks Huayou's business line is somewhat awkward, and the profit model is not yet very clear. The business also has breaks. Huayou SP and mobile music business are not very profitable. Huayou's business line is expected to have a bright future, but at present, these are all unprofitable. She said. Another greater uncertainty and challenge comes from the country’s policies and the prospects of 3G. There are still many policies about 3G that have not been finally determined, especially the charges, if they are still very expensive, then these things are unlikely to happen. Zhao Xufeng said. Given the current situation of Grandview, it is not yet ready to integrate Huayou. Great energy is always limited, and Hu友's business is unfamiliar to盛大. Mr. Zhang revealed that ""The integration of the companies acquired by盛大is actually very small. Many times, they just give a sum of money, and how to operate and make profits still depends on the original operators."" But this company is huge and is its own, and the level of commitment is much less. Mr. Zhang said, ""To buy it outright and just leave it there without any management, let alone to invest in it."" But the concerns of the outside world, from a certain perspective, do not seem to be necessary. This grand acquisition of Huayou was made through the secondary market, and these 51% are all tradable shares, which can be completely thrown away, as long as they are sold at a higher price than the current purchase price. Zhao Xufeng believes that for both sides, this is not an absolute acquisition, and both sides have room for maneuver and reservation. Zhao Xufeng said, ""This acquisition is essentially for Suning to become the majority shareholder of Huayou, unlike a full acquisition, where they would be responsible for it and not be able to sell it easily. If it doesn't do well, it will become a bad asset."" In 2005, when many people saw the news of Shanda's acquisition of Sina, they thought Chen Tianqiao was ""talking nonsense,"" and he indeed could not enter Sina's board of directors to realize his beautiful wish of integrating Sina's resources for Shanda's use.

iPhone冻坏苹果拒绝修理(图)新浪科技讯北京时间1月11日晚间消息，挪威iPhone手机用户莱妮·克里斯汀·罗维克(LeniKristinLvvik)近日表示，她的iPhone出现故障后，苹果却拒绝负责维修。去年10月，罗维克购买了一部iPhone4手机。两个多月后，iPhone出现了故障，而苹果却拒绝为她修理，理由是在温度过低的条件下使用了iPhone。根据苹果的规定，iPhone的使用温度在0摄氏度至35摄氏度之间。而罗维克当时开着汽车，将iPhone与汽车音响相连。当时的室外温度是零下12摄氏度，苹果以此为理由拒绝为罗维克修理。而罗维克称，尽管当时室外温度为零下12摄氏度，但估计汽车内部的温度高达零上20度。目前，苹果尚未对此发表评论。(李明)	莱妮·克里斯汀·罗维克,罗维克,李明	负向	An iPhone that was frozen by Apple refused to repair (picture) Sina Technology News, on the evening of January 11, it was reported that the Norwegian iPhone user Leina Kristin Lvvik recently said that after her iPhone malfunction, Apple refused to be responsible for repair.

On April 11, the booming Chinese social game development market has attracted more and more international companies to join. John Pleasants, CEO of Playdom, one of the three major social game developers on the Facebook platform, said at the China Social Game Summit on Saturday that the company is preparing to set up an office in China and is actively seeking more excellent developers and partners. John said that the company was looking forward to the rapid expansion of the Chinese social game market this year, and hoped to find a more cost-effective and excellent development team in China. It is speculated that, given the five acquisitions and investments that Playdom has made since November last year, the company is likely to directly choose the acquisition method when entering the Chinese market. Playdom raised its first external funding of $43 million in November last year, with four venture capital firms led by EA, and rumors that Playdom would use the funds to quickly narrow the gap with Playfish and Zynga and go public, and usually acquisition is the fastest way for a company to expand. John represented Playdom in the roundtable forum on “Focus on Users, Play in the World” at the China Social Game Summit on Saturday, along with other social game developers such as Playfish and Rockyou from the US, and Hotcool and 5 Minutes from China. Among Playdom’s competitors, Playfish, which is also under EA, has already set up an office in Beijing and has a large team. Zynga, which is valued at 5 billion US dollars, is rumored to open an office in China soon. In addition, another strong competitor of Facebook, Rockyou, is also actively promoting its entry into the Chinese market. Its co-founder Shen Jia has been actively looking for partners in China since last year. On Saturday, Shen Jia hosted a forum at the Chinese social game summit, where he had close contact with Chinese social game developers. The data shows that Playdom is headquartered in California, USA, and the company is valued at more than 260 million US dollars. Three of the four co-founders in the core management team are Chinese. 60% of the company's revenue comes from applications on the MySpace platform, 40% of the revenue comes from applications on the Facebook platform, 70% of the profits come from social games, 10% of the revenue comes from advertising, and the rest 20% comes from other services.

陕西新赛季竟“自废武功”省钱政策难掩危机四伏看透了易帜看不清前途这是换汤不换药的改变“没有新变化，怎么可能有新变化呢。老板还是原来的老板，思路还是原本的思路。这次陕西男篮的易帜，完全是换汤不换药的改变啊。”谈到陕西男篮由亚旅到锂源动力的变化时，一位知情者笑着说道。至少，在公开接受媒体采访时，就连锂源俱乐部的“掌舵者”梁瑞麟也没有否认这个事实。“投资方锂源动力与亚旅体育产业有限集团其实是一脉相承的关系。亚旅集团控股了珠海锂源动力，在珠海锂源动力的基础上又投资了唐山、长春和辽源三家锂源动力公司。这四家公司还与其他公司构成了中国锂源动力集团。既然俱乐部已经归亚旅了，锂源动力产品又是亚旅新的投资主业，球队的新名称就冠以锂源动力的名称。”既然与亚旅时代相比，如今的锂源动力完全堪称“新瓶装旧酒”，那么延续亚旅时代的思路，自然就是一件顺理成章的事情了，而这种思路就是省钱为先了。从去年季后赛的无外援“裸奔”，到大龙、张伟、陈照升、代勇的“一个不留”，再到如今的放走最后一位大佬。无论“培养新人”的招牌如何光鲜，但又怎能遮盖“自废武功”的事实。看不清前途这般决策锂源能成长吗“新赛季我们的口号是：锻炼新人。希望球迷和媒体理解我们，我们会全力以赴，但成绩肯定不如去年。”展望锂源男篮的新赛季时，新任主帅史利平这样说道。球队需要新人，而新人总需要成长时间，这些广大三秦球迷自然懂得、也理解。但要变这种“短痛”为不痛，这里面的“技术含量”却远不是说说口号就可以解决的问题。在多次和记者聊天时，“神奇教练”吴庆龙就曾多次表示，新人的培养必须尊重篮球运动的规律，要在保持他们自信心的基础上，通过比赛提高他们运用技战术动作的能力、临场发挥水平和应付比赛的经验。以锂源男篮目前的阵容，要指望这些大多数在二队时都没有“练到位”的年轻队员，短时间内承担起“挑大梁”的重任。到底是“揠苗助长”，还是“急功近利”呢？对此，多位CBA资深教练也表示，“现在陕西队这帮孩子，打青年联赛就是10名以后的水平，没有老队员的传、帮、带，冒冒失失地让他们打CBA，还不把他们打得连东西南北都分不清啊。”记者张勇	梁瑞麟,张伟,陈照升,代勇,史利平,吴庆龙,张勇	负向	"Shaanxi's new season is ""self-defeating"" and the frugality policy can hardly conceal the crisis. Seeing through the change of flag, but not clear about the future. This is a change without changing the medicine. How can there be new changes without new changes? The boss is still the original boss, and the thinking is still the original thinking. This change of the Shaanxi men's basketball team is a complete change of name without changing the essence. When talking about the change of Shaanxi men's basketball team from Yali to Lithium Power, a person who knows said with a smile. At least, even Liuyuan Club’s “ringleader” Liang Ruilin did not deny this fact in public interviews with the media. The investment party, Lithium Power, and the Yaloo Sports Industry Group Co., Ltd. are actually related by a common lineage. Yalv Group controls Zhehai Lithium Power, and has invested in three more Lithium Power companies in Tangshan, Changchun and Liaoyuan based on Zhehai Lithium Power. These four companies also form part of the Chinese Lithium Power Group with other companies. Since the club has already returned to Yalv, and lithium source power products are Yalv's new investment main business, the new name of the team will be named after the name of lithium source power. Since lithium power is now completely comparable to ""new wine in old bottles"" compared to the era of Yalv, it is only natural to continue the思路 of Yalv, and the idea is to save money first. From the bare playoff last year without any foreign players, to the ""no one left"" of Daliang, Zhang Wei, Chen Zhaosheng, and Dayong, and then to the release of the last big boss. No matter how dazzling the sign of ""cultivating new people"" is, it can never cover up the fact that it is ""self-destructing martial arts"". Can't see the future, such decision lithium source can grow? ""In the new season, our slogan is: to train new people. We hope that fans and the media will understand us, and we will do our best, but the results will definitely not be as good as last year. When looking forward to the new season of the Lithium Source men's basketball team, the new head coach Shliping said so. The team needs new players, and new players always need time to grow. These vast fans of San Qin naturally understand and are tolerant. But to turn this “short-term pain” into no pain at all, the “technological content” involved is far from a problem that can be solved by just saying slogans. During multiple chats with reporters, ""Magic Coach"" Wu Qinglong has repeatedly stated that the cultivation of new players must respect the laws of basketball, and they should be improved in terms of their ability to use technical and tactical actions, their ability to perform on the spot, and their experience in dealing with games, on the basis of maintaining their confidence. With the current roster of the lithium source men's basketball team, it is expected that these young players, who were not fully trained in the second team, will shoulder the heavy responsibility in a short period of time. Is it ""helping the seedling grow by pulling it up"", or ""hastening success""? For this, several veteran coaches of CBA also said, ""Now, the kids of Shaanxi team, their level in youth league is after the 10th place, without the old players' passing and helping, they will be lost if they are forced to play CBA.""

The index broke through 2600 points twice, and the lowest was 2589.61 points. After that, the index slowly recovered and regained 2600 points. At the early close, the SSE Composite Index closed at 2,612.04 points, down 1.26%, with a half-day turnover of 61.9 billion yuan, showing a tendency to increase. The ratio of the number of stocks that rose and fell was about 1:2. Not counting ST stocks, there were 2 stocks that reached the limit up on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and no stocks reached the limit down. The market showed that a large number of Shanghai stocks fell in the morning, with only about 250 stocks rising, and the major stocks performed poorly, with only 10 stocks of the SSE 50 rising. Only 5 sectors rose in the two markets in terms of sectors. Stimulated by the resumption of trading of Yangtze Power (600900.SZ), the power sector led the way with a 1.28% increase, followed by the winemaking and food sector with a 1.07% increase. The other three sectors saw increases of less than 1.0%. Four sectors, including securities, real estate, tourism and hotels, and foreign trade, saw the largest declines, all exceeding 2.0%. Coal, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, venture capital, banking, telecommunications, non-ferrous metals and other sectors saw the largest declines, all falling more than 1.0%. BOCHK said that today's volume surge after the resumption of trading of Changjiang Power failed to support the index. Currently, the market's gains are too large and the valuation is too high, which brings some adjustment pressure. However, the funding and policy face support the market, which indicates that the market's structural differentiation will continue, and short-term fluctuations will intensify.

公募基金集体失算金融股逆势加仓损失惨重重仓金融股使基金陷入尴尬的境地。据本报记者统计，在刚刚过去的这轮股市调整中，由于仓位中金融股(下跌中的领跌板块)占比过大，众多股票型基金净值缩水严重。加仓后现暴跌截至2009年四季度末，基金前七大重仓股全部为金融行业个股。其中，招商银行有208只基金持有，中国平安有205只基金持有，兴业银行有166只基金持有，民生银行有117只基金持有，中信证券有110只基金持有，浦发银行有96只基金持有，北京银行有94只基金持有。这一数字较2009年三季度有明显加仓的痕迹。基金对此的解释是，由于整个中小盘估值偏高，目前风险较大，因此进行减持。而金融行业个股是整个大盘中最为明显的估值低洼地带，加仓金融股有利于规避风险，同时有望获取超额收益。可惜的是，期望中的小盘股向大盘股的风格转换并未实现，基金此次再度成为暴跌前最后的接棒者。截至2月5日，基金前七大重仓的金融股中，除民生银行外全部都高于大盘10.31%的跌幅，其中中信证券、北京银行和兴业银行跌幅超过15%。本轮金融股的暴跌，使基金损失惨重。晨星数据显示，截至2月5日跌幅超过10%的基金数目已经超过120只，这些基金的重仓股也多为金融股。抱团取暖为何失效？但是值得注意的是，基金似乎不但选错了金融股，还选错了金融股中的公司。基金数目仅有9只的中国银行，今年以来跌幅仅有4.62%，是所有金融股中跌幅最浅的个股。基金数目不足5只的光大证券和招商证券，今年以来甚至出现上涨。保险行业中，基金数目最少的中国太保，跌幅也仅有8.82%，是惟一一只跌幅未超过10%的保险股。这也显示出，基金扎堆的金融股跌幅大于基金较少的金融股。基金抱团取暖非但没有成功，反而成为“累赘”。事实上，基金选择的金融股，就质地上来说一般高于基金较少的金融股。分析人士指出，基金“抱团取暖”失败的原因，是由于有的基金率先砸盘。因为金融板块基金较多，政策也较为透明，因此基金没有共同进退的可能。事实上，有分析指出，基金行业2009年的状元华夏大盘，就率先砸盘金融股，所以避过了本轮的惨跌。另一个原因是，从去年四季度末基金加仓幅度来看，该买金融股的基金都已经买得差不多了。因此，当有基金不断出货时，接盘的资金明显不够，金融股只能下跌。未来还得买金融股？不过，目前看来，基金对金融股的“贼心不死”。信达证券基金行业分析师李琛表示，从目前基金减仓的情况来看，单周减仓幅度也就1%左右，有时候还会出现加仓。这表明，除一小部分基金外，其余基金并未大幅减持金融股。从业绩上来看，尽管紧缩政策预期强烈，但是分析人士对金融行业的业绩预期却仍然稳定，这也是基金仍然不舍金融股的根本原因。“经过本轮下跌，现在基金看明白了，今年的股市很难指望有太高的收益，因此注意风险是第一位的。而金融股经过下跌，估值进一步下降。在政策明朗后，基金还是得买它，目的不是为了获取超额收益，而是为了得到平均的收益。”一位基金业内人士表示。商报记者陈洁	李琛,陈洁	负向	Publicly-raised funds collectively miscalculated and increased their holdings of financial stocks against the trend, resulting in heavy losses. Heavy holdings of financial stocks put funds in an embarrassing situation. According to the statistics of the reporter, in the just past round of stock market adjustment, due to the proportion of financial stocks (the leading sector to fall) in the position was too large, many stock funds suffered serious shrinkage in net value. After the increase in position, the sharp decline occurred. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, the top seven heavily held stocks of the fund were all financial industry stocks. Among them, China Merchants Bank has 208 funds, Ping An of China has 205 funds, Industrial Bank has 166 funds, Minsheng Bank has 117 funds, CITIC Securities has 110 funds,浦发银行 has 96 funds, and Beijing Bank has 94 funds. There is a clear sign of a significant increase in this figure in the third quarter of 2009. The fund explained that, due to the high valuation of small and medium-sized stocks, the risk is currently high, so they are reducing their holdings. And financial stocks are the most obvious undervalued areas in the entire market. Adding to financial stocks can help avoid risks, and at the same time, it is expected to obtain excess returns. Unfortunately, the expected style shift from small-cap to large-cap stocks did not materialize, and funds once again became the last recipients before the crash. As of February 5, among the top seven holdings of the fund, all financial stocks except for Minsheng Bank were more than 10.31% lower than the market, with CITIC Securities, Beijing Bank, and Industrial Bank falling more than 15%. The plunge of the financial stocks in this round has caused heavy losses to the funds. Morningstar data shows that the number of funds with a decline of more than 10% by February 5 has exceeded 120, and the heavyweights of these funds are mostly financial stocks. Why does huddling together for warmth fail? But it is worth noting that the fund seems to have picked the wrong financial stocks, and the wrong companies within those stocks. With only 9 funds, the China Merchants Bank, which has fallen only 4.62% so far this year, is the stock with the shallowest decline among all financial stocks. Guangda Securities and Shenzhen Securities, which have fewer than 5 funds, have even seen increases so far this year. Among the insurance companies, CPIC, which has the fewest funds in the insurance industry, has only dropped by 8.82%, making it the only insurance stock whose decline has not exceeded 10%. This also shows that financial stocks with a concentration of funds have fallen more than financial stocks with fewer funds. The fund抱团取暖not only failed, but also became a burden. In fact, the financial stocks selected by the funds are generally of better quality than the financial stocks selected by funds with fewer selections. Analysts point out that the failure of the funds to huddle together for warmth is due to the fact that some funds dumped their holdings first. Because there are more funds in the financial sector and the policies are more transparent, it is unlikely that the funds will move in unison. In fact, analysis has pointed out that the champion Huaxia大盘of the fund industry in 2009, had already dumped financial stocks, so it avoided the sharp decline in this round. Another reason is that, from the fund's increased position at the end of the fourth quarter last year, the funds that should have bought financial stocks have already bought them. Thus, when there is a continuous outflow of funds, the funds to take over are clearly insufficient, and financial stocks can only fall. Will you have to buy financial stocks in the future? But, for now, funds are not giving up on financial stocks. Li Chen, an analyst in the fund industry of Xinda Securities, said that from the current situation of fund reduction, the reduction in a single week is only about 1%, and sometimes there will be an increase in holdings. This suggests that, apart from a small portion of funds, the rest of the funds have not significantly reduced their holdings in financial stocks. In terms of performance, although the expectation of a tight policy is strong, analysts still expect the performance of the financial industry to be stable, which is also the reason why funds are still unwilling to give up financial stocks. After this round of decline, the funds have realized that it is difficult to expect high returns in the stock market this year, so the first priority is to pay attention to risks. And financial stocks, after a decline, saw further declines in valuation. After the policy is clear, the fund still needs to buy it, the purpose is not to obtain excess returns, but to obtain average returns. As stated by a fund industry insider. Business reporter Chen Jie
男子驾车撞人后又向伤者扔6枚燃烧汽油弹(组图)29日，沈阳发生的一起恶性事件引来恐惧、悲伤的同时，也引发了一串疑问。他撞人后烧车，往路人身上扔了6枚“汽油弹”，是为了什么？全身烧伤面积达到95%、在重症监护室里伤者，与行凶者是什么关系？有人猜测，这事是因寻仇报复而起。事发现场>>撞人后扔6枚汽油弹29日12时许，沈阳市铁西区保工街南十三路交通岗西侧20米处。两辆消防车停在路边，事发地被围上了警戒线。透过警戒线，一辆牌照为辽AY0548墨绿色吉普车停在现场，车辆已被烧穿，前后风挡玻璃被烧化，后车门附近有一瓶装有黄色透明质液体的白酒瓶子，瓶子旁边放着一个白色桶，车下有一只黑色皮鞋。距吉普车不到两米远的马路边石上，一些被烧黑的衣物残留物留在原地，一个银灰色的皮带头落在地上，皮带被烧化。据附近门市的目击者回忆，事情发生在11时30分许，一名男子驾驶该辆吉普车将一位男性路人撞倒，司机下车后发现人没死，又上车将两个玻璃瓶子往车下扔。“刚开始我们以为他要救人呢，后来发现连人带车全着了。”目击者说，当时躺在车下的人慢慢爬了出来，站起来后又倒下了。很多路过的人都围了过来，帮忙拨打120和119。一名目击者说：“他一直往路边爬，爬上了马路边石，我看见他的衣服、裤子都被火烧了，他自己反复在地上翻滚，想要灭火。”就在这时，吉普车司机又从车内取出了4个玻璃瓶子！另一名目击者描述，他看清楚了，司机扔的是汽油瓶，因为扔完之后路人身上的火更大了。”目击者说。还有目击者表示：“扔完瓶子之后，车里还飞出了好多百元大钞，大风把钱都刮飞了，我还看见有人捡呢。”很快，消防队员赶到了现场，迅速将吉普车的火扑灭，120急救车将伤者送往医院急救。肇事者失踪>>他是体格健硕的中年男子附近门市目击者说：“我们当时都顾着看被火烧的人了，谁也没注意肇事者跑哪去了？伤者被120送走后，大家才反应过来。”沈阳市铁西区刑警大队刑警在现场走访了大量门市，也没有得到任何有关于肇事者的消息。此时，一名老者拿着相机称，自己拍到了肇事者。但相机中只能看到一名年龄稍长，体格健硕的中年男子。15时许，肇事车被拖车拖走。16时45分，几名伤者家属跟随警方到公安部门做笔录。18时许，记者电话联系了出警的保工派出所，并在交通信息网上查询辽AY0548墨绿色吉普车，发现该车并没有违章记录，但根据车牌显示该车属于法库县。截至记者19时发稿时，肇事者还未抓到，案件还在进一步调查中。有人猜测，这事是因寻仇报复而起。伤者病情危重>>儿子哭喊“爸，一定要挺住！”29日13时许，记者在辽宁省武警总队医院住院部电梯间见到了刚刚做完放射检查的伤者。他脸色发黑，身上被一块白色塑料布包裹着，嘴角流出少量鲜血，额头鼓着一个大包。看到躺在病床上的父亲，儿子泣不成声：“爸，一定要挺住，挺住啊……”13时50分许，伤者被推进手术室，多名家属赶到医院。一名伤者家属告诉记者，伤者58岁，姓佟，以前在某工商所工作，现在自己在沈阳市于洪区开了一间家具厂，专门生产沙发，“他家就住在事发地附近，平时没听说跟什么人结仇啊？怎么能下手这么狠？”据医院接诊医生介绍，伤者全身大面积烧伤，其中90%为特重烧伤，病情危重，需要尽快手术。“我们考虑给伤者做个气管切开，伤者有吸入性损伤，应该是呼吸道出现了问题。”医生说，一般情况下，大面积烧伤的患者都需要抗感染治疗，如果被烧的皮肤受到感染，后期手术就会有麻烦。因为患者的年龄较大，医生安排三天后给患者做植皮手术，具体情况还要看患者恢复的程度。15时45分，伤者被推出手术室。医生表示，“今晚他会很危险，可能随时出现问题，需要送到ICU重症监护室接受治疗，这几天我们也会密切关注他的病情。”律师说法>>点火人涉嫌故意杀人罪辽宁诚铭律师事务所主任秦大军表示，案件中点火烧车的男子可能涉嫌故意杀人罪。他认为，如果吉普车驾驶人在撞到人后马上送伤者去医院，可能不会面对刑法的处理。但往路人身上浇汽油，就不是交通肇事罪了，而是刑事案件，涉嫌故意杀人未遂。“如果案件中肇事者精神有问题但没有精神残疾证的话，也同样需要负相应刑事责任”。此外，如果伤者最终不治身亡的话，肇事者将面临死刑的处罚。(本报综合)相关：沈阳发生点燃汽油瓶杀人案警方正抓捕嫌犯	儿子,佟,秦大军	负向	"A man drove into people and then threw 6 burning gasoline bombs at the injured (photo gallery).

What was the purpose of him hitting someone, burning the car, and throwing 6 ""gasoline bombs"" at passersby? The burn victim, who has 95% of his body burned and is in the ICU, what is the relationship between the victim and the attacker? It was speculated that the incident was revenge. The scene of the incident>> After hitting someone, he threw 6 gasoline bombs at 12:00 on the 29th, at the west side of 20 meters from the traffic post of South 13th Road, Bao Gong Street, Tiexi District, Shenyang City. Two fire trucks are parked by the roadside, and the scene of the incident is cordoned off with police tape. Beyond the police cordon, a dark green jeep with the license plate number Liaoning AY0548 was parked at the scene. The vehicle had been burned through, and the front and rear windshields had melted. There was a bottle of yellow transparent liquid white wine near the rear door, and a white bucket was placed next to the bottle. There was a black leather shoe under the car. Some burnt clothing remnants were left on the curb less than two meters away from the jeep, and a silver belt buckle fell on the ground, the belt melted. According to the eyewitnesses of the nearby store, the incident occurred around 11:30, when a man drove a jeep and knocked down a pedestrian. After getting out of the car, the driver found that the person was still alive and threw two glass bottles out of the car. At first, we thought he was saving someone, but later we found that both the person and the car were on fire. The witness said that the person who was lying under the car crawled out slowly, stood up and then fell down again. Many people who passed by gathered to help call 120 and 119. A witness said, ""He kept crawling to the roadside, climbed onto the roadside curb, and I saw that his clothes and pants were on fire. He rolled on the ground repeatedly, trying to put out the fire."" Just then, the jeep driver took out four glass bottles from the car! Another eyewitness described that the driver threw a can of gasoline, because the fire on the pedestrian was even bigger after he threw it. Witnesses said. Another eyewitness said that after the bottles were thrown, a lot of hundred-dollar bills flew out of the car, and the wind blew the money away, and I saw someone picking them up. Soon, the firefighters arrived at the scene and quickly put out the fire in the jeep. The ambulance rushed the injured to the hospital for emergency treatment. The culprit has gone missing>>He is a sturdy middle-aged man. Witnesses from nearby shops said, ""We were all watching the person who was burned by the fire at that time, and no one noticed where the culprit ran?"" Only after the injured was taken away by 120 did everyone realize. The criminal investigation team of the criminal investigation detachment of Tiexi District, Shenyang City, visited a large number of shops in the scene, but did not obtain any information about the perpetrator. At this time, an old man holding a camera said that he had taken a picture of the culprit. But the camera could only see a middle-aged man with a sturdy build and a slightly older appearance. At 15:00, the accident vehicle was towed away by a tow truck. At 4:45 p.m., several families of the injured followed the police to the public security department to make a statement. At 6:00 p.m., the reporters contacted the police station of Baogong and queried the traffic information network for the dark green jeep with the license plate number Liaoning AY0548. It was found that the car had no record of traffic violations, but according to the license plate, the car belonged to Faku County. The perpetrator had not been apprehended by the time the journalist submitted the report at 7:00 p.m., and the case was still under further investigation. It was speculated that the incident was revenge. The patient's condition is critical>>The son cries out, ""Dad, you have to hold on!"" At 1:00 p.m. on the 29th, the reporter met the injured person who had just finished the radiological examination in the elevator of the inpatient department of the Liaoning Provincial Armed Police Corps Hospital. His face was black, wrapped in a white plastic sheet, with a little blood oozing from the corner of his mouth, and a big bump on his forehead. Seeing his father lying on the hospital bed, the son burst into tears, ""Dad, you have to hold on, hold on..."" At around 1:50 PM, the injured person was taken into the operating room, and several family members rushed to the hospital. A relative of the injured told the reporter that the injured was 58 years old, surnamed Tong, who used to work at a market supervision office, and now runs a furniture factory in the Huyu District of Shenyang, specializing in the production of sofas. ""He lives near the scene of the incident, and I haven't heard that he has any grudges with anyone before?"" How could you be so ruthless? According to the doctor who received the patient at the hospital, the patient suffered from extensive burns over the whole body, with 90% of them being severe burns, and the condition was critical, requiring immediate surgery. We are considering tracheotomy for the injured, who has inhalation injury, and the respiratory tract may have problems. The doctor said that in general, patients with large burns need anti-infection treatment, and if the burned skin is infected, there will be trouble with later surgery. Because the patient is older, the doctor has scheduled a skin graft for the patient three days later, and the specific situation will depend on the extent of the patient's recovery. At 3:45 p.m., the patient was wheeled out of the operating room. The doctor said, ""He will be very dangerous tonight, and there may be problems at any time, and he needs to be sent to the ICU for treatment. We will also closely monitor his condition in the next few days."" "">Lawyer Says >> The man who set fire to the car is suspected of intentional homicide. Qin Dajun, the head of Lingning Chengming Law Firm, said that the man who set fire to the car in the case may be suspected of intentional homicide. He believes that if the jeep driver sends the injured to the hospital immediately after hitting them, he may not face criminal prosecution. But pouring gasoline on passers-by is not a traffic accident crime, but a criminal case,涉嫌 attempted intentional homicide. If the perpetrator has mental problems but no mental disability certificate, they still need to bear corresponding criminal responsibility. In addition, if the victim dies in the end, the perpetrator will face the death penalty. (Comprehensive report) Related: A murder case with a lit gasoline can occurred in Shenyang.

宁波银行：融资方式尚需斟酌新浪提示：本文属于研究报告栏目，仅为分析人士对一只股票的个人观点和看法，并非正式的新闻报道，新浪不保证其真实性和客观性，一切有关该股的有效信息，以沪深交易所的公告为准，敬请投资者注意风险。宁波银行处于快速扩张期，资本消耗较快。我们预计2009年末风险加权资产(RWA)将达到约850亿元，融资50亿元将提升核心资本充足率5.9个百分点至16.4%左右。按照RWA每年增长40%、ROA保持1.15%、派息率20%的假设，此次融资可以支持宁波银行2010-2012年的业务发展需要，对于风险加权资产回报率(RoRWA)较高的宁波银行来说，适时补充资本有利于长远发展和股东价值创造。但是融资方式还可以更加完善。首先，核心资本充足率和资本充足率的目标是否有必要保持在9%和12%以上还需探讨。其次，如果宁波银行适当降低分红比率，即使是2010年核心资本充足率也能保持在9%左右。在这种情况下进行股权融资对现有股东摊薄较大。此次增发4.3亿股后，EPS将摊薄17%，2010年ROE将从18.3%摊薄至14.7%。我们认为，核心资本充足率在8%-11%之间时，带有次级条款的可转债是比直接股权融资更好的资本补充方式。管理层应当在资本充足和股东回报之间寻找更好的平衡，充分利用杠杆。我们认同宁波银行在适当时机和适当方式进行的资本补充行为，尽管现行方案虽然补充核心资本的确定性较强，但一次摊薄幅度较大。虽然看好宁波银行的长期业务发展模式和管理能力，但短期内估值不具有吸引力。——摘自中金公司毛军华《宁波银行：融资有利长远发展，方式尚需斟酌》已有_COUNT_条评论我要评论	毛军华	正向	"Bank of Ningbo: Financing methods still need to be carefully considered. Sina提示: This article belongs to the research report column, which is only the personal opinion and view of an analyst on a stock, and is not a formal news report. Sina does not guarantee its authenticity and objectivity. All relevant information about the stock, as announced by the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges, shall prevail, and investors are advised to pay attention to the risks. Bank of Ningbo is in a period of rapid expansion, with fast capital consumption. We expect RWA to reach around 85 billion yuan by the end of 2009, and financing of 5 billion yuan will increase the core capital adequacy ratio by 5.9 percentage points to around 16.4%. Assuming an annual growth rate of RWA of 40%, ROA of 1.15%, and a dividend payout ratio of 20%, this financing can meet the business development needs of Ningbo Bank from 2010 to 2012. For Ningbo Bank with a high return on risk-weighted assets (RoRWA), timely capital replenishment is conducive to long-term development and the creation of shareholder value. But the financing model can still be improved. First, whether the core capital adequacy ratio and the capital adequacy ratio targets should be maintained at above 9% and 12% respectively still needs to be discussed. Second, if Ningbo Bank appropriately reduced its dividend payout ratio, its core capital adequacy ratio in 2010 could have remained around 9%. Equity financing in this case would be highly dilutive to existing shareholders. After this increase of 430 million shares, EPS will be diluted by 17%, and ROE in 2010 will be diluted from 18.3% to 14.7%. We believe that convertible bonds with secondary terms are a better way to replenish capital than direct equity financing when the core capital adequacy ratio is between 8% and 11%. Managers should seek a better balance between capital adequacy and shareholder returns, and fully leverage. We agree with Ningbo Bank's capital replenishment behavior at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner, although the current plan, although the certainty of replenishing core capital is stronger, but the one-time dilution is large. Although we are optimistic about Ningbo Bank's long-term business development model and management capabilities, the valuation in the short term is not attractive. ——From Ma Junhua's article ""Bank of Ningbo: Financing is beneficial for long-term development, but the method needs to be carefully considered"" on CICC.

ESPN名嘴称奥胖不如科比鲨鱼：再胡说出来单挑新浪体育讯　职业生涯最后730天(大鲨鱼准备再打两年就退役)，沙奎尔-奥尼尔选择加盟波士顿凯尔特人。在湖人功成名就的奥尼尔，此番转投死敌自然引来争议不小，ESPN脱口秀主持人吉姆-罗姆就在自己的节目中抨击了凯尔特人这一决定。“丹尼-安吉签下这名前湖人球员是个错误，哪怕只是用140万美元的老将底薪。”罗姆说道，“而且奥尼尔虽然15次入选全明星赛、手握4枚总冠军戒指，但从来都不如他的前队友科比-布莱恩特那么具有职业精神，不如科比对比赛那么投入。”这番言论可搞得沙克火大了，在微博(http://t.sina.com.cn)上奥尼尔马上展开了凶猛反击，“吉姆-罗姆，我对自己的职业生涯、对自己留下的荣耀都很满意，很显然你对自己的成就不是太满意，哦，对不起我忘了，你好像根本就没什么成就。”调侃了罗姆一番后沙克还不过瘾，他接着在微博上写道，“不如这样吧罗姆，咱们也别兜圈子了，你和我直接单挑，让ESPN直播，让全世界知道你是否只是一个嘴上强硬的软蛋！如果你赢了，我就把这个赛季的工资全部捐给慈善机构，具体是哪家你挑！”罗姆也不示弱，“得了吧沙克，如果你这个赛季挣800万那我还考虑一下，只是老将底薪？那我也太亏了，而且你好像跟我不是一个重量级吧？而且你刚才不还说我根本就没有成就吗？那你为什么还要屈尊和这样一个人单挑？”眼看打嘴仗有些吃亏，奥尼尔翻出了罗姆之前调戏NFL四分卫吉姆-埃维雷特打球像个娘们、结果被埃维雷特恐吓的视频，不过还是遭到了罗姆的反唇相讥。“要求助于他人啦？真无聊、真没劲，你怎么啦奥尼尔？你不是大亚里士多德吗？就这点水平？”罗姆在微博上写道。两人的微博唇枪舌剑目前暂时告一段落，奥尼尔加盟凯尔特人实战效果如何暂时未知，但可以预见不管球队有几巨头，奥胖都有本事成为镁光灯下的焦点......(贝吉塔)	奥胖,科比,鲨鱼,沙奎尔-奥尼尔,奥尼尔,凯尔特人,吉姆-罗姆,罗姆,丹尼-安吉,科比-布莱恩特,沙克,吉姆-埃维雷特,埃维雷特,大亚里士多德,贝吉塔	正向	"ESPN commentator said Shaq is inferior to Kobe and O'Neal: If you continue to talk nonsense, we will have a one-on-one match. Sina Sports News On the last 730 days of his career (Shaq is preparing to retire after two more years), Shaquille O'Neal chose to join the Boston Celtics. Orlando, who achieved success with the Lakers, naturally caused a lot of controversy when he transferred to the rival team, and Jim Rome, the host of ESPN's talk show, criticized the Celtics' decision on his own program. Signing Danny Ainge to a veteran’s minimum contract for $1.4 million, even for a former Lakers player, was a mistake. Rom said, ""And although O'Neal was selected for the All-Star team 15 times and won four championship rings, he was never as professional as his former teammate Kobe Bryant, and never as committed to the game as Bryant."" This statement made Shaq very angry, and on Weibo (http://t.sina.com.cn), Shaq immediately launched a fierce counterattack, ""Jim Rome, I am very satisfied with my career and the glory I have left behind. It is obvious that you are not satisfied with your achievements. Oh, sorry, I forgot, it seems that you have no achievements at all."" Shaq was still not satisfied after making fun of Romain.

Seeing that he was at a disadvantage in the verbal battle, O'Neal dug up the video of Rom's previous harassment of NFL quarterback Jim Everett, who played like a woman, but was intimidated by Everett, but Rom still retorted. Ask for help from others? How boring and uninteresting! What's wrong with you, O'Neal? Are you not Aristotle? Is that all you can do? Rom wrote on Weibo. The Twitter war between the two has temporarily come to an end. It is currently unknown how effective O'Neal's performance will be when he joins the Celtics.

法国电信5年内投20亿欧元发展光纤本报讯法国电信日前宣布，法国电信监管当局ARCEP新的监管政策已经令他们有信心重新开始投资建设FTTH网络。从现在起到2015年，法国电信将投资20亿欧元在法国人口密集的主要地区开始FTTH建设。为了向零售和批发用户提供最高品质的电信服务，过去几年来法国电信每年用于网络建设的支出都高达30亿欧元以上。2007年以来法国电信已经部署了不少光纤接入设施，截至去年9月底，该公司发展了33000光纤用户。2009年9月，由于不满ARCEP当时的政策，法国电信宣布暂停光纤网络建设计划。此轮FTTH建设将会主要集中在巴黎等特大城市以外的地区。法国政府今年1月出台新政策鼓励电信运营商在中等城市建设FTTH网络，并表示愿意提供低息贷款。法国电信计划年内在戛纳、蒙彼利埃、奥尔良、斯特拉斯堡和土伦等城市开展网络建设。该公司表示欢迎其他运营商参与共同投资。截至2009年9月底，法国电信共有25.5万超宽带用户。(人民邮电报)		正向	France Telecom to Invest 2 Billion Euros in Fiber Over 5 Years. France Telecom announced that the new regulatory policy of the French telecom regulatory authority, ARCEP, has given them the confidence to start investing in the construction of FTTH networks again. From now until 2015, France Telecom will invest 2 billion euros in the construction of FTTH in the main densely populated areas of France. To provide the highest quality telecommunications services to retail and wholesale customers, France Telecom has spent more than 3 billion euros annually on network construction in recent years. Since 2007, France Telecom has deployed a number of fiber access facilities, and by the end of last September, the company had developed 33,000 fiber users. In September 2009, France Telecom announced the suspension of its fiber network project due to its dissatisfaction with ARCEP's policies at the time. This round of FTTH construction will mainly focus on areas outside of special large cities such as Paris. The French government has introduced a new policy this January to encourage telecom operators to build FTTH networks in medium-sized cities, and has indicated a willingness to provide low-interest loans. France Telecom plans to build its network in Cannes, Montpellier, Orleans, Strasbourg and Toulon this year. The company expressed welcome to other operators to participate in co-investment. As of the end of September 2009, France Telecom had 255,000 super broadband users. (China Post Daily)
腾讯近百万买下高朋域名团宝网借机出风头每经记者庄春晖发自上海全球最大团购网站Groupon通过与腾讯合资的方式进入中国市场，已经基本得到确认，2月14日，合资成立的“高朋网”的域名gaopeng.com已显示转至腾讯名下，据称交易价格为98万元人民币。高朋上线在即，不乏借机炒作者。紧握Groupon.cn中文域名的团宝网春节后即以Groupon的醒目抬头展开了对全国各大楼宇的广告轰炸；同时，国内团购网站“满座”也因成语“高朋满座”的合理联想，对“高朋”的“横刀杀出”颇有怨念，称将严防对方的任何侵权行为。Groupon入华初期，如何避免类似“真假开心网”姓名大战的再次上演，成了待解之题。中文名“过户”昨日，《每日经济新闻》记者通过whois查询gaopeng.com，发现该域名信息已经产生变化，显示现持有人为深圳腾讯计算机系统有限公司。信息显示，该域名生成于2001年，前任持有者为“中小学信息技术教育之家”，2010年6月经过续费，下一个租约到期日为2012年7月。据称，4个多月前，腾讯公司开始为该域名询洽，并以98万元人民币买下。“高朋”域名的变化证明了此前的业界消息。2011年1月初，Groupon入华意向曝光，Groupon决定暂时放弃收购独立团购网站，转而与腾讯公司合作。2月11日，消息称腾讯已与Groupon成立合资公司，公司注册资本1亿美元，双方各持50%。该团购合作项目的中文名定为“高朋”。团宝网拒绝合作许多业界人士都认为，“高朋”不是Groupon的最佳选择，但它别无选择，因为最合适的域名groupon.cn早已被国内团购网站团宝网占用。团宝网于2010年3月成立，号称上线2个月后就实现盈利，目前覆盖全国300多个城市。据团宝网CEO任春雷透露，2010年年底，Groupon高管一行曾来华与团宝网洽谈过入华合作及收购问题，遭到婉拒。今年年初，Groupon入华消息传出，团宝网借机大出风头。春节过后，该公司展开了对北京、成都等地的各大楼宇的广告轰炸，并宣布启动招聘2000人团队。高朋VS满座失去最佳中文域名的Groupon、腾讯两家公司，最终敲定合作项目中文名“高朋”，不料又横生枝节。业内质疑，国内已经有一家名为“满座”的团购网站，“高朋满座”的联想是否会混淆、转移消费者对“满座网”的印象？满座网CEO冯晓海表示不满。他称，满座网取“千里逢迎，高朋满座”之意，创办时为取名绞尽脑汁。“现在不能再保持沉默了，如果Groupon在华的宣传有任何对满座网的侵权行为，我们将奉陪到底。”	庄春晖,gaopeng,任春雷,冯晓海	正向	"Tencent bought the Gaopeng domain name for nearly one million, and Tuanbao took the opportunity to show off. ZHUANG Chunhui, a journalist from Jinji, Shanghai. The world's largest group buying website, Groupon, has entered the Chinese market through a joint venture with Tencent, which has basically been confirmed. On February 14, the domain name of the joint venture ""Gaopeng"" - gaopeng.com has been transferred to Tencent, and it is said that the transaction price is 980,000 RMB. High Friends is about to go online, and there are not a few people taking advantage of the opportunity to hype it up. Groupon.cn, holding the Chinese domain name of Tuanbaowang, launched an advertising blitz on the national office buildings with the prominent heading of Groupon after the Spring Festival; meanwhile, the domestic group-buying website “Manzuo” also harbored resentment over the reasonable association of the Chinese idiom “gaopeng manzuo” (full of distinguished guests) and the “gaopeng” (distinguished guests) of “Manzuo” (full of), and claimed that it would strictly guard against any infringement by the other party. How to avoid a similar ""HappyNet"" name war when Groupon entered China, became a question to be solved. The Chinese name ""transfer"" yesterday, The NBD News reporters through whois queried gaopeng.com, found that the domain name information has already changed, showing the current holder is Shenzhen Tencent Computer System Co., Ltd. The information shows that the domain was created in 2001, and the previous holder was ""Home of Information Technology Education in Primary and Secondary Schools"". It was renewed in June 2010, and the next lease expires in July 2012. It is claimed that four months ago, Tencent began to inquire about the domain name and bought it for 980,000 yuan. The change of the ""Gao Peng"" domain name proves the previous industry rumors. In early January 2011, Groupon's intention to enter the Chinese market was revealed, and Groupon decided to temporarily abandon the acquisition of independent group buying websites and instead cooperate with Tencent. On February 11, it was reported that Tencent had set up a joint venture with Groupon, with a registered capital of $100 million, and each party holding 50%. The Chinese name of the group-buying cooperation project is ""Gaopeng"". Taobao.com refused to cooperate, and many industry insiders believed that “Gaopeng” was not the best choice for Groupon, but it had no choice because the most suitable domain name, groupon.cn, had already been occupied by the domestic group buying website Taobao.com. Taobao Group was established in March 2010, claiming to achieve profitability two months after going online, and currently covers more than 300 cities across the country. According to Ren Chunlei, CEO of Groupbuy, in the end of 2010, Groupon executives came to China to negotiate cooperation and acquisition with Groupbuy, but they were politely refused. At the beginning of this year, Groupon’s entry into China was announced, and TuanBaoNet took the opportunity to shine. After the Spring Festival, the company launched an advertising blitz on major buildings in Beijing, Chengdu and other places, and announced the launch of a recruitment team of 2000 people. Groupon and Tencent, which lost the best Chinese domain name, finally agreed on the Chinese name ""Gaopeng"" for their joint project, but then another complication arose. There is doubt in the industry that there is already a group-buying website called ""Zuozuo"" in China, and the association of ""high guests and full seats"" may confuse and divert consumers' impression of ""Zuozuo Network""? President Feng Xiaohai of Manzuo Network expressed dissatisfaction.

NBA游戏中阿联乃奇才头牌大将军人气暴跌勉强入围新浪体育讯　北京时间9月10日消息，据ESPN报道，NBA新赛季还有2个月就要开打，而各种新款NBA游戏也即将发售。日前，ESPN专家马克-斯坦因通过个人途径提前获得了热门游戏《NBAJAM》的一些资料，现将原文摘译如下：《NBAJAM》是一个电视游戏，主要玩法是球星3对3斗牛，画风卡通，略带搞笑。目前大多数球队的阵容包括3名现役球员(都是球迷投票选出的人气球星)和一名传奇球星。有9支球队具备第四名现役球员，这是因为球迷的投票统计太过接近，游戏制作人员只能将这些人气明星都保留下来。此外还有一些球队没有传奇球星，这种情况通常有两种解释：1.球员的授权出现了问题(比如迈克尔-乔丹)；2.这支球队缺乏历史(比如夏洛特山猫)。此外，当游戏进行到一定程度后，玩家可以解锁一些隐藏的球员。令人惊喜的是，奇才竟是9支具备四名现役球员的球队之一，而易建联更是以超高的人气进入了奇才的3V3阵容。据斯坦因透露，奇才的现役球员阵容是易建联，安德雷-布莱切，吉尔伯特-阿里纳斯以及约翰-沃尔，而传奇球星则是已经故去的传奇中锋马纽特-波尔。虽然斯坦因并没有指明谁才是奇才人气最旺的球星，但根据其余球队的阵容排名推测，各支球队阵容的第一名理应是球迷投票选出的人气王。比如波士顿凯尔特人的阵容依次为凯文-加内特，保罗-皮尔斯，拉简-隆多以及雷阿伦；芝加哥公牛的阵容依次是德里克-罗斯，洛尔-邓，乔金-诺阿以及卡洛斯-布泽尔；迈阿密热火的阵容依次是德维恩-韦德，勒布朗-詹姆斯以及克里斯-波什。奥兰多魔术的阵容依次是德怀特-霍华德，文斯-卡特以及拉沙德-刘易斯。斯坦因表示，由于“持枪门”事件造成的恶劣影响，球迷投票中本没有阿里纳斯，但考虑到他的实力，制作人员最终仍将“大将军”加进了阵容。因此，奇才现在人气最旺的三名球员依次应该是易建联，布莱切以及沃尔。虽然阿联还没有为奇才打过比赛，但他居然已经成为奇才的人气球星，由此也可以看出阿联在美国球迷心中的地位。面对如此热情的球迷，阿联只能在新赛季用行动报答他们的厚爱了。(咕哒)	阿联,马克-斯坦因,斯坦因,迈克尔-乔丹,易建联,安德雷-布莱切,布莱切,吉尔伯特-阿里纳斯,阿里纳斯,约翰-沃尔,沃尔,马纽特-波尔,凯文-加内特,保罗-皮尔斯,拉简-隆多,雷阿伦,德里克-罗斯,洛尔-邓,乔金-诺阿,卡洛斯-布泽尔,德维恩-韦德,勒布朗-詹姆斯,克里斯-波什,德怀特-霍华德,文斯-卡特,拉沙德-刘易斯	正向	"In the NBA game, Zhou Qiancai, the main force of the Beijing team, has a sharp drop in popularity.勉强入围: barely made it into the list. Sina Sports News. On September 10th, Beijing time, according to ESPN, the NBA season will start in two months, and various new NBA games will soon be released. Recently, ESPN expert Mark Stein obtained some information about the popular game NBAJAM in advance through personal channels. The following is a translation of the original text: NBAJAM is a TV game, the main gameplay is star 3 on 3 bullfight, the style is cartoon and slightly humorous. Currently, most team rosters include 3 active players (all of whom are fan-voted stars) and a legendary player. There are 9 teams with current players in the fourth place because the fan voting statistics are too close, and the game developers can only keep these popular stars. In addition, there are some teams without legendary stars, and there are usually two explanations for this: 1. There are problems with the authorization of the players (such as Michael Jordan); 2. The team lacks history (such as Charlotte Hornets). Moreover, after the game has progressed to a certain extent, players can unlock some hidden players. To our surprise, the Wizards are one of nine teams with four current players, and Yi Jianlian even entered the Wizards' 3v3 team with extremely high popularity. According to Stein, the Wizards' current roster includes Yi Jianlian, Andray Blatche, Gilbert Arenas and John Wall, while the legendary player is the legendary center Manute Bol, who has passed away. Although Stein did not specify who the most popular star in the team was, according to the ranking of the team's roster, the first place of each team should be the popularity king selected by the fans. For example, the Boston Celtics' lineup consists of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, and Ray Allen; the Chicago Bulls' lineup consists of Derrick Rose, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, and Carlos Boozer; the Miami Heat's lineup consists of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh. The Orlando Magic's roster consists of Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, and Rashard Lewis. Stein said that Ariza was added to the roster despite not being included in the fan vote due to the negative impact of the ""gun incident,"" but the producers ultimately included him because of his strength. So, the Wizards' three most popular players should be Yi Jianlian, Baty, and沃尔. Although Zhou has not yet played a game for the Wizards, he has already become a popular star of the Wizards, which also shows the status of Zhou in the hearts of American fans. In the face of such enthusiastic fans, Alain can only repay their generous love with action in the new season. (Gudu)"
组图：弹头婚礼众星云集周杰伦精彩魔术表演新浪娱乐讯9月17日台北，南拳妈妈(听歌)弹头举办结婚喜宴，喜宴上众星云集，包括：TANK、杨宗纬(听歌)、黄立成(听歌)、李玖哲(听歌)、房祖名(听歌blog)、温岚(听歌blog)、杨千霈、林俊杰(听歌blog)、柯有纶等多名艺人全都到场祝贺，可见弹头夫妇在圈内人缘超好。晚间六点半开始，艺人陆陆续续进场，最令人意外的艺人身影就是成龙(听歌blog)的儿子房祖名，祖名表示今天晚上是来为自己将来的婚礼见习的，虽然不知道自己要在多少年以后才结婚，但是还是跟好朋友黄立成及李玖哲一起来参与婚礼，房祖名与黄立成及李玖哲三人是在美国就认识的多年好友，黄立成与李玖哲也分别说出了对新人祝福的话，他们是代表女方皮皮的好友，因为担任舞者的皮皮曾帮李玖哲伴过舞。林俊杰与柯有纶两人一同进场，看到好友弹头结婚两人也心痒想婚了，开出了一大堆择偶条件，柯有纶表示希望对方很会煮菜、又会做家事、又会写词、又可以陪她做音乐，十项全能的老婆让大家都怀疑柯有纶真的想结婚吗？而一旁的JJ则表示说，不论结婚对象是谁，只要是身心相爱的守护对方就好，也祝弹头与皮皮可以长长久久。在嘉宾都进场之后，紧接着要登场的是今晚的男女主角，今天一身正式礼服的弹头与穿着白纱的皮皮，两人从红毯的一端慢慢步向礼堂，在婚前许多八卦杂志说弹头是先有后婚，让两人的婚姻不受期待，弹头表示今后会用时间来证明她俩是真心相爱的，讲到师父今天大力跨刀，弹头心存感激的说：“二十岁以前都是父母在照顾我，二十岁以后都靠周董大力提拔。”对于师父周杰伦(听歌)的感激之情全都写在脸上。今晚最大的高潮就在于唱片公司杰威尔的大老板周杰伦现身表演魔术，一连三段的魔术表演有变出新娘、人体漂浮、还有?袋生酒杯，大家都知道周董爱表演魔术，今天会在婚礼上表演，周杰伦表示是因为弹头的要求，也是因为即将发行的新专辑中MV将以魔术表演的形式呈现，所以周董最近勤学魔术，访问到一半周董就忍不住技痒，拉起身旁的宣传即兴表演一段。说到弹头要结婚周董先是吓傻了眼，杰伦表示其实弹头才小他没几岁，对他来说结婚还是遥远的事，他预计自己是在35岁时结婚，看到弹头闪电结婚，杰伦表示真的出乎意料之外，因为他原本以为弹头跟皮皮只是玩一玩很快就会分了，没想到竟然会结婚，也让他破功送出了欧洲蜜月旅行的礼物，因为周董原先不看好两人会结婚，所以夸口说如果结婚就送欧洲蜜月旅行，现在让弹头赚饱了，不仅有免费的巨星表演、结婚大红包、还有欧洲蜜月行，看来有个有钱有势的师父是很吃香的。周杰伦也透露自己新专辑即将在十月份发行，新专辑的曲风一样是周式风格，结合了魔术表演，杰伦表示新专辑中，他希望化身为疗伤歌王，里头收入了许多情歌，要拯救现在许多失恋男女的心，周式情歌将在下个月引爆。TUNGSTAR/文并图	弹头,周杰伦,杰伦,TANK,杨宗纬,黄立成,李玖哲,房祖名,温岚,杨千霈,林俊杰,柯有纶,成龙,皮皮,JJ,周董	正向	"Photo: Tanka's wedding, a star-studded wedding, Jay Chou's wonderful magic show, Sina Entertainment News [News] September 17, Taipei, South Fist Mom (listen to the song) Tanka held a wedding banquet, and many stars were present at the banquet, including: TANK, Yang Zongwei (listen to the song), Huang Licheng (listen to the song), Li Jie (listen to the song), Feng Zunming (listen to the blog), Wen Lan (listen to the blog), Yang Qianpei, Lin Junjie (listen to the blog), Koo Youlun, and many other artists all came to congratulate, which shows that Tanka's couple has a super good relationship in the circle. At 6:30 in the evening, the artists began to enter the venue one by one. The most surprising artist was the son of Jackie Chan, Feng Zunming. Zunming said that he came to the wedding today to learn for his future wedding. Although he did not know when he would get married, he still came with his good friends Huang Licheng and Li Jiazheng to participate in the wedding. Feng Zunming, Huang Licheng, and Li Jiazheng are old friends who have known each other for many years in the United States. Huang Licheng and Li Jiazheng also said words of blessing to the new couple. They are the friends of Pi Pi, the female, because Pi Pi, who served as a dancer, had once danced with Li Jiazheng. Lin Junjie and Koo Yulun entered the venue together, and when they saw their friend Tung Tai get married, they also felt itchy to get married and listed a lot of conditions for choosing a partner. Koo Yulun said that he hoped the other party was very good at cooking, could do housework, could write lyrics, and could accompany her to make music. A wife with ten abilities made everyone doubt whether Koo Yulun really wanted to get married. While JJ said that as long as it was someone who loved and protected you mentally and physically, it didn't matter who the marriage partner was, and also wished that Head and Papi could be together forever. After all the guests arrived, the main male and female stars of the night were about to make their appearance. Today, Tapon, wearing a formal suit, and Pipi, wearing a white wedding dress, walked slowly from one end of the red carpet to the auditorium. Many gossip magazines said before the wedding that Tapon was a marriage without love, which made people not expect their marriage. Tapon said that she would use time to prove that she and Pipi were really in love. When talking about the master, Tapon said gratefully, ""Before the age of 20, I was taken care of by my parents, and after the age of 20, I relied on Jay Chou's strong promotion."" All the gratitude for Master Jay Chou (listen to the song) is written on his face. The biggest climax of the night was Jay Chou, the big boss of the record company JVR, appearing to perform magic. He performed three consecutive magic shows, including conjuring a bride, floating a human body, and making a wine glass appear in a bag. Everyone knows that Jay Chou loves to perform magic, and today he will perform at the wedding because it was Pop's request, and also because the new album to be released soon will have a music video in the form of a magic show. So Jay Chou has been diligently learning magic recently. Halfway through the interview, Jay Chou couldn't resist the urge to perform, and he spontaneously performed a magic show for the people around him. When it comes to Tung's head getting married, Jay first went dumbfounded. Jay said that actually Tung's head is only a little younger than him, and for him, marriage is still a long way off. He expects to get married at the age of 35. Seeing Tung's head get married like a flash, Jay said that it was really unexpected, because he originally thought that Tung's head and Papi would just play around and split up very soon, but he never expected that they would get married. It also made him break his promise and gave Tung's head a gift for a European honeymoon. Because Jay originally did not think that the two would get married, he boasted that if they got married, he would give them a European honeymoon. Now, Tung's head has made a profit, not only with free star performances, wedding red envelopes, but also with a European honeymoon trip. It seems that having a rich and powerful master is very popular. Jay Chou also revealed that his new album will be released in October, and the style of the new album is still the Zhou style, combining magic performances. Jay said that in the new album, he hopes to become a healing song king, and there are many love songs in it, to save the hearts of many broken-hearted men and women now, Zhou-style love songs will explode next month.

IPO重启担忧升温调整幅度合理华讯财经[华讯财经6月5日收评：]受到外围市场及昨日尾盘的发飙的影响，周五沪深两市双双高开，在权重类股的推动下，大盘再创近期反弹新高，但逼近2800点附近时上行压力略有显现之后市场出现了强势震荡调整的趋势，由于IPO新规征集意见今日截至，各方力量趋于谨慎，但尾盘钢铁、金融带头杀跌，大盘迅速翻绿，两市5日均线险些失守。从盘面观察，个股跌多涨少，涨跌比率约为3：5，板块方面，酿酒、造纸、船舶、农林等板块表现相对较强，水泥、电力、金融、地产、钢铁等表现较弱。消息面上，工信部发布船舶工业调整和振兴规划；09年政府公共投资资金下达61.9%；新股IPO征求意见今截止重启窗口来临；中铝195亿美元注资力拓被曝告吹；5月份主要宏观指标不乐观已出现滞胀典型先兆；五电力集团敲定山东电煤合同涨幅低于煤企要求；铁矿石谈判又添变数：必和必拓再推指数定价等。华讯财经认为，周五大盘继续维持高位震荡态势，由于受IPO新规征集意见今日截至市场对IPO重启担忧升温，尾盘大盘出现一波杀跌，两市股指迅速翻绿，有考验5日均线支撑的欲望。整体来看，市场震荡调整尚在合理范围，投资者不必过于担忧，预计大盘短期内将维持震荡格局。操作上，注意个股波段运作，对于升幅较大的个股可适当减持，而重点关注具有补涨潜力的个股机会。		正向	The concern of the resumption of IPO is rising, and the adjustment is reasonable. Huaxun Financial [Huaxun Financial, June 5th, market review: ] Affected by the performance of the surrounding market and the end-of-day performance of the previous day, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets opened high on Friday. Under the promotion of weighty stocks, the market has created a new high of the recent rebound. However, after the market approached the 2800 point, the upward pressure was slightly revealed. The market showed a strong oscillation adjustment trend. Due to the fact that the collection of opinions on the new rules of IPO is due today, all parties are becoming more cautious. However, at the end of the day, steel and finance led the plunge, and the market quickly turned green. The 5-day moving average of the two markets was nearly lost. From the chart, it can be seen that the number of stocks that fell was more than those that rose, with a ratio of about 3:5. In terms of sectors, the brewing, papermaking, shipbuilding, agriculture and forestry sectors performed relatively strongly, while the cement, power, finance, real estate, and steel sectors performed relatively weakly. In terms of news, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released the ship industry adjustment and revitalization plan; 61.9% of the government's public investment funds were allocated in 2009; the IPO consultation ends today, and the window for the resumption of the IPO is about to open; the $19.5 billion investment in Rio Tinto by Chinalco has been revealed to have failed; the main macroeconomic indicators in May are not optimistic, and the typical early signs of stagflation have appeared; the five power groups have agreed on the coal contract in Shandong, with a price increase lower than the requirements of the coal companies; there are more changes in the iron ore negotiations: BHP has proposed index pricing again. Union Finance believes that the stock market will continue to maintain a high oscillation pattern on Friday. Due to the fact that the deadline for collecting opinions on the new IPO rules today, the market is worried about the resumption of IPO, and the stock market fell sharply at the end of the day, and the two market indices turned green quickly, and there is a desire to test the support of the 5-day moving average. Overall, the market fluctuations are still within a reasonable range, and investors do not need to be overly concerned. It is expected that the market will maintain a fluctuating pattern in the short term. In terms of operations, pay attention to the short-term operation of individual stocks. For stocks with a larger increase, you can appropriately reduce holdings, while focusing on the opportunities of stocks with the potential for catch-up increases.
日本阿含桐山杯张栩轻松夺冠实现三连霸将战古力新浪体育讯　点击观看棋谱北京时间11月15日，第15届日本阿含-桐山杯围棋快棋赛在京都阿含宗总本山的“蜗牛庵”落子，结果卫冕冠军张栩九段执白2目半击败高梨圣健八段，实现日本阿含-桐山杯三连冠。他将在2009年1月17日和中国阿含-桐山杯冠军古力九段进行中日冠军对抗赛。张栩九段是国际棋界公认的日本围棋实力第一人，其快棋功夫尤其了得，目前保持着日本阿含-桐山杯、NHK杯两大快棋赛的冠军头衔，在另一快棋赛龙星战中也曾两次夺冠。高梨圣健八段则没有张栩那么辉煌的战绩，他自1988年入段以来，除了在2001年获得第31届新锐淘汰赛冠军以外，再无任何拿得出手的表现。在本届阿含-桐山杯中，高梨八段运气甚佳，从预选赛中杀出后分到了相对较弱的上半区，并且本区两名强手山下敬吾棋圣和高尾绅路九段都早早被淘汰；张栩则在强手如林的下半区连续击败了“金童”井山裕太、二十五世本因坊赵治勋、关西棋界第一人结城聪。从双方的实力和往绩来看，张栩名人、小棋圣占有绝对的优势。本局双方都以二连星开局。近期张栩名人的棋风偏向极端的先捞后洗，总是在开局就占据大量实地，随后打入对手的大模样一决胜负，这一战也不例外。双方第一次折冲从左下角展开，迅速形成了张栩取地、高梨取势的格局，面对强敌的高梨圣健八段筑起一道外势后又连占两个星位，颇有昔日武宫“宇宙流”的风格。而张栩当然不惧，白24挂入黑阵，双方在右下角进入第一次战斗。面对张栩名人充满自信的战法，高梨八段显得相当谨慎，频频长考，尤其白28强硬地靠出显然出乎高梨圣健的意料，当黑棋决定29虎住时，黑棋的保留时间已经用掉了将近三分之一，而此时张栩用时还不到10分钟。可以看出，面对职业生涯中首个夺得大棋战冠军的机会，高梨圣健在思想上还是比较保守。黑棋选择了保住右边实地，此后又侵入左下角成活，但代价是中央厚势反过来变成了孤棋。此时张栩敏锐地动出右边伏兵，高梨在应对中不够强硬，结果白棋连续拔花，架起铜墙铁壁后对中腹黑大块形成巨大威胁。攻守既然已经逆转，高梨圣健干脆一条道走到黑，脱先守右上角，彻底转向实地，以中腹治孤当作赌胜负的筹码。但是张栩也不强行进攻，同样在守住左上角后渗透进黑棋上方，保持实地的领先。几个回合下来，上边黑地变白地，而黑棋虽然加厚了中腹，但对铁桶一般的白棋并无太大威胁。至此棋局进入白棋略优的细棋格局，官子争夺中张栩下出了白122的破空好手，黑棋寄予厚望的中腹被破，高梨圣健无力争胜，虽然坚持收完了官子，但结果早已无法改变。张栩夺得本届日本阿含-桐山杯冠军后，实现了在这一赛事中的3连冠，获得1000万日元冠军奖金。他将在2009年1月17日和中国阿含-桐山杯冠军古力九段进行中日冠军对抗赛，届时新浪网将继续带来现场直播和报道，敬请广大棋迷网友关注！(胡恒日本京都报道)	张栩,古力,高梨圣健,高梨,圣健,山下敬吾,高尾绅路,井山裕太,赵治勋,结城聪,胡恒	正向	"The Japanese Ahhan Togayama Cup Zhang Xugu won the championship easily and achieved three consecutive championships. He will play against Gu Li. The chess谱 of the 15th Japanese Ahhan Togayama Cup Go quick chess was launched at the ""Snail Temple"" of the general headquarters of Ahhan宗 in Kyoto. The champion of the previous championship, Zhang Xugu, won 2.5 points with white stones and achieved three consecutive championships of the Japanese Ahhan Togayama Cup. He will play a champion对抗赛between the Chinese Ahhan-Tongshang Cup champion Gu Li 9 dan on January 17, 2009. Zhao Xuhu, 9 dan, is recognized as the strongest Go player in Japan by the international chess community. His blitz chess skills are particularly outstanding. He currently holds the titles of the two major blitz chess tournaments in Japan, the Ahhan-Tokyo Cup and the NHK Cup. He has also won the Dragon Star War twice. Ko Lian-chen, who has eight dan ranks, did not have as glorious a record as Zhang Xugu. Since he entered the dan ranks in 1988, he has only won the champion of the Newcomers Elimination Tournament in the 31st edition in 2001, and has not achieved anything else that can be shown off. In this year's Ahhan-Tongshang Cup, Gao Li, 8-dan, was very lucky, and after winning the preliminary match, he was in the relatively weaker upper half of the draw, and both strong players, Shinya Yamashita, Go Saint, and Shinya Kojima, 9-dan, were eliminated early. Zhang Xugu, on the other hand, defeated the ""Golden Boy"" Yutaro Inoue, the 25th Honinbo Zhao ZhiXun, and Kojima Satoru, the first person in the Kansai Go Association, in the strong lower half. Based on the strength and past performance of both players, Jang Yucheng, the Honorary Champion and the Junior Go Saint, has an absolute advantage. Both sides opened with two consecutive stars. Recently, the style of Zhang Xu, a famous player, has tended to be extremely ""grabbing first and cleaning later"", always occupying a large amount of territory at the beginning of the game, and then invading the opponent's large space to decide the outcome. This game is no exception. The first round of negotiations between the two parties unfolded from the lower left corner, quickly forming a pattern where Zhang Xu took the land and Koga took the momentum. After Koga Shikanosuke, an eighth-dan player, built a peripheral pattern against a strong opponent, he occupied two star points in a row, with a style reminiscent of the ""Cosmic Flow"" of the former Fujisaki. And Zhang Xue of course was not afraid, and played White 24 to enter the black camp. The two sides entered their first battle in the lower right corner. In response to the confident fighting style of Zhang Xu, the 8-dan Go player Gao Li was very cautious, often taking a long time to think. The white 28 move, which strongly invaded, was clearly unexpected by Gao Li. When the black stone decided to play 29 to cut, the black stones had already used up nearly a third of their time, while Zhang Xu still had less than 10 minutes left. It can be seen that, facing the opportunity to win the first major chess championship in his career, Kojima Seikan is still rather conservative in his thinking. The black stones chose to protect the right side territory, and then invaded the lower left corner to survive, but the thick central strength became a lonely stone in return. At this time, Zhang Xu acutely moved out the right hidden force. Gao Li did not respond strongly enough, and as a result, the white stones continuously pulled the flowers, and after setting up a copper wall and iron fence, they formed a huge threat to the black large group in the center of the board. Since the attack and defense had already been reversed, Kōri Seiken went all in, played a move outside the main flow to defend the upper right corner, and completely turned to territory play, treating the lonely defense in the center as a bet on the outcome. But Zhang Xue did not attack forcefully, and after securing the left upper corner, he penetrated above the black stones to maintain the lead in territory. After several rounds, the upper side changed from black to white, but although the black stones thickened the center, they posed no great threat to the white stones that were as solid as a bucket. The game entered a fine game with slightly better white stones. In the endgame, Zhang Xu played the good move of 122 to break the enemy's air. The thick center of the black stones, which had high expectations, was broken. Kojima Seikenn had no chance to win. Although he finished the endgame, the result could not be changed. After Zhang Xu won the title of the 2022 Ahan-Tōyama Cup, he achieved three consecutive championships in this event and won 10 million yen as the champion. He will play the champion Gu Li 9 dan of China's Ahhan-Tongshang Cup on January 17, 2009, and Sina.com will continue to bring you live coverage and reports, please pay attention to it!

Jianzi, who found a good family, felt that the company he had worked with for the past ten years was only interested in making money, which had made him shoot many plays that he was not interested in. And his girlfriend Zhang Qian (blog) will give birth in Hong Kong at the end of this month, and Jet Wong claims that he will enter the delivery room to witness the birth process! Dickie, who is successful in both career and love, revealed that he would soon become a father at the end of this month.

When asked if he was working hard to earn money for the baby to be born, he said, ""For big and small, for my woman!"" “Dicky revealed that Zhang Qian in Beijing will return to Hong Kong to give birth to the baby with him later, and when asked if he would accompany the other party to the delivery room to witness the delivery process, Dicky nodded and said, ""I watched someone do eye surgery before, wasn't it like this!""

全英音乐奖三大改革新主席新气象(图)新浪娱乐讯北京时间2月16日消息，据国外媒体报道，当地时间2月15日晚，第31届全英音乐奖颁奖典礼在伦敦举行。新上任的主席大卫·约瑟夫对本届大奖进行了一系列改革，从评委团成员、奖杯设计到颁奖典礼，形成了一番新的气象。评委团组成改革，影响大奖归属第一届全英音乐奖举办于1977年，从1982年开始成为一年一度的音乐盛事。全英音乐奖有“英国的格莱美”之称，但是近年来被批评提名呆板，奖项归属缺乏惊喜。新主席大卫·约瑟夫由此在今年进行了改革，不但颁奖典礼的举办地点首次从伦敦的伯爵宫迁至O2体育馆，评委团成员也进行了改革。以往的1000名评委是由音乐制作人、出版商和零售商组成的，今年首次加入了一批音乐艺人。最终使大奖归属指向了与以往不同的方向。民谣艺人此次受到格外的重视，劳拉·玛琳意外击败强劲的对手谢莉尔·科尔、艾丽·戈尔丁，成为“英国最佳女艺人”，新人乐队曼福德及子弟的首张专辑《SighNoMore》赢得最令人垂涎的大奖——“英国年度专辑”。尽管一直得到评论界的好评以及主流媒体的关注，玛琳新专辑《ISpeakBecauseICan》在英国榜单的最好成绩只是第4名。主要成员马库斯·曼福德也对自己的乐队能够获得大奖感到“惊异”，作为伦敦本土乐队，这还是他们在英国电视网的首次重要亮相。为之颁奖的是谁人乐队的罗杰·达尔特里，他致辞时说：“很高兴看到英国音乐工业还有足够的钱来举办一场狂欢派对。”大卫·约瑟夫的改革虽然体现出左倾倾向，却并没有脱离主流的需求。青春偶像贾斯汀·比伯获得“国际最具突破艺人”便是最好的证明。昔日以男孩乐队出道的接招也在不惑之年迎来了首个全英音乐奖“最佳英国组合”。尽管乐队曾多次获得全英音乐奖，成员罗比·威廉姆斯是获得该奖次数最多的艺人，接招之前却从未得到过“最佳英国组合”。他们的事业曾经如日中天，在不欢而散后，威廉姆斯开始了成功的个人事业。2005年乐队的其余四名成员重组，他们举办了英国历史上最大规模的巡演，门票在几分钟内抢购一空；他们的专辑《Progress》发行首日销量超过23万，打破绿洲乐队的纪录，成为英国销售最快的专辑。八个月前，威廉姆斯终于抛却前嫌重回乐队。颁奖典礼上，乐队上演了感人的一幕。成员马克·欧文抽泣着对威廉姆斯说：“小罗，感谢你回来加入我们。”奖杯重新设计，融入国旗元素本届全英音乐奖的奖杯由英国时尚达人薇薇安-维斯特伍德(VivienneWestwood)重新设计，手持盾牌的金属女神变成了身着英国国旗图案礼服的美人。在奖项的设置上，7个英国国内奖和6个国际奖几乎平分秋色，但是本届全英音乐奖似乎更重视对本土优秀艺人的奖励。说唱歌手TinieTempah和PlanB都来自伦敦。22岁的TinieTempah去年刚发行了首张专辑《Disc-Overy》，此次就获得了“英国最具突破艺人”和“英国最佳单曲”两项大奖。他在领奖时说，要把荣誉献给代表“和平与爱”的英国音乐。PlanB凭借概念专辑《TheDefamationofStricklandBanks》成功转型，不但成为英国专辑榜的冠军，还获得了本次“英国最佳男艺人”。在国际奖项上，加拿大摇滚乐队拱廊之火成为最大赢家，包揽“国际最佳组合”、“国际最佳专辑”两个大奖。两天前他们刚刚凭借新专辑《郊外》获得格莱美“年度专辑”奖。主唱魏因·巴特勒发表感言时特意感谢了曾经影响他们的英国乐队：“从新秩序到大卫·鲍伊、TheClash、CultureClub、赶时髦和TheSmiths。感谢英国，非常感谢！”他还建议不熟悉他们的英国观众可以到网络上搜索一下。颁奖典礼刻意编排，注重现场演出罗杰·达尔特里把全英音乐奖颁奖典礼形容成狂欢派对，那已经是历史了。以往的典礼确实只是观礼者的自娱自乐，台下不是成排的坐席而是一桌桌盛宴。这次尽管餐桌没有变，O2体育馆却比伯爵宫更像演出场所，而非宴会举办地。本届典礼更加注重演出效果，节目的衔接也更为紧凑。接招献上了开场秀，这也许是全英音乐奖颁奖典礼上男性演员最多的开场演出。一群打扮成防暴警察的舞者围绕在五名成员周围，暗指英国前不久的学生抗议事件。热辣的舞蹈伴随着男舞者们的脱衣秀，引得台下笑声阵阵。PlanB献上了新专辑的歌曲串烧，其中还穿插烈火焚身的特技表演。获得“国际最佳男艺人”的美国说唱歌手CeeLoGreen在闭幕演出中演唱了他的大热单曲《ForgetYou》，与之合作的是获得“英国最佳女艺人”提名的帕洛玛·菲丝。之前的格莱美之夜，他刚刚和好莱坞女星格温妮丝·帕特洛合作表演了这首歌。参加演出的还有拱廊之火、曼福德及子弟、TinieTempah、“国际最佳女艺人”得主蕾哈娜，没有被提名的女星艾薇儿·拉维尼和阿黛勒也献上了精彩的演唱。艾薇儿、谢莉尔·科尔、迪兹·拉斯可还担任了颁奖嘉宾。Linden/文	大卫·约瑟夫,劳拉·玛琳,玛琳,谢莉尔·科尔,艾丽·戈尔丁,戈尔丁,马库斯·曼福德,罗杰·达尔特里,贾斯汀·比伯,接招,罗比·威廉姆斯,威廉姆斯,马克·欧文,文,小罗,薇薇安-维斯特伍德,VivienneWestwood,TinieTempah,Tempah,PlanB,魏因·巴特勒,巴特勒,大卫·鲍伊,帕洛玛·菲丝,格温妮丝·帕特洛,蕾哈娜,艾薇儿·拉维尼,艾薇儿,阿黛勒,迪兹,拉斯可	正向	"Three Major Reforms of the BRIT Awards, New Chairman and New Atmosphere (Photos) Sina Entertainment News, on February 16, Beijing time, according to foreign media reports, the 31st BRIT Awards ceremony was held in London on the evening of February 15. David Joseph, the newly appointed chairman, has made a series of reforms to this year's award, from the members of the jury, the design of the trophy to the award ceremony, forming a new atmosphere. The reform of the jury composition has affected the归属 of the grand prize. The first Brit Awards was held in 1977 and became an annual music event from 1982. The Brit Awards, known as the “Grammys of Britain,” have recently been criticized for their rigid nominations and lack of surprises in award归属. David Joseph, the new chairman, has made reforms this year, not only moving the venue of the award ceremony from the Earl's Court in London to the O2 Arena for the first time, but also reforming the members of the jury. The 1,000 judges in the past were made up of music producers, publishers, and retailers, and this year a batch of music artists joined for the first time. Ultimately, the prize went to a different direction than in the past. The folk artist was given special attention this time, Laura Marling unexpectedly defeated the strong opponents Cheryl Cole and Ellie Goulding to become the ""Best British Female Artist"", and the debut album of the new band Manfredi, ""Sigh No More"", won the most coveted award - ""Album of the Year"". Despite the critical acclaim and mainstream media attention she has received, Marlin's new album, ISpeakBecauseICan, only reached number four on the UK charts. Marcus Manford, one of the main members, was also amazed that his band had won a major award, as a London-based band, it was their first major TV appearance in the UK. Roger Daltrey of the Who presented the award, and said, ""It's great to see that the British music industry still has enough money to throw a party."" David Joseph's reforms, although showing a left-leaning tendency, did not deviate from the mainstream. Justin Bieber, an idol of youth, winning the award of ""International Breakthrough Artist of the Year"" is the best proof. Back in the day, Take That, who debuted as a boy band, won the first Brit Award for Best British Group at the age of forty. Although the band has won the Brit Award many times, Robbie Williams, a member of the band, has won the most Brit Awards, but did not win the ""Best British Group"" before Take That. Their business was once booming, and after a parting without any joy, Williams began a successful personal career. The remaining four members of the band reunited in 2005 and held the largest tour in British history, with tickets selling out in minutes; their album Progress sold more than 230,000 copies on the first day of release, breaking Oasis's record and becoming the fastest-selling album in the UK. Eight months ago, Williams finally put aside the grudge and returned to the band. At the award ceremony, the band performed a touching scene. Member Mark Owen sobbed to Williams, ""Rooney, thank you for coming back to join us."" The trophy was redesigned to incorporate the flag element. The metal goddess holding the shield at this year's Brit Awards was transformed into a beauty wearing a dress with the pattern of the British flag. In terms of the awards, seven domestic awards and six international awards were almost evenly matched, but this year's Brit Awards seem to place more emphasis on rewarding outstanding domestic artists. Rap singers Tinie Tempah and Plan B are both from London. At 22, Tinie Tempah, who released his first album, Disc-Overy, last year, won the awards for “Best British Breakthrough Act” and “Best British Single.” When accepting the award, he said that he would dedicate the honor to British music representing ""peace and love."" Plan B succeeded in the transformation with the concept album The Defamation of Strickland Bank, becoming the UK Albums Chart champion and winning the ""Best British Male Artist"" award. At the international awards, the Canadian rock band The Archies won the most prizes, taking home the ""International Best Group"" and ""International Best Album"" awards. They just won the Grammy Award for ""Album of the Year"" for their new album ""Suburbia"" two days ago. When lead singer Wayne Butler made his acceptance speech, he thanked the British bands that had influenced them: from New Order to David Bowie, The Clash, Culture Club, Bananarama and The Smiths. Thank you, the UK, very much! He also suggested that their unfamiliar British audience could search the Internet for more information. The ceremony was deliberately staged, with an emphasis on live performances. Roger Daltrey described the Brit Awards as a party, and that is history. Previous ceremonies were indeed just for the amusement of the spectators, with banquets instead of rows of seats in the audience. Though the table remained the same, the O2 Arena was more of a performance venue than a banquet hall like the Prince's Palace. This ceremony places more emphasis on the performance effect, and the connection between programs is also more compact. JLS performed the opening show, which may be the most male performers in the history of the Brit Awards opening performance. A group of dancers dressed as riot police surround five members, alluding to the recent student protests in the UK. The spicy dance accompanied by the striptease of the male dancers brought down the house with laughter. Plan B performed a medley of songs from his new album, which included a special performance of fire burning. American rapper CeeLoGreen, who won the award for ""International Best Male Artist,"" performed his hit single ""ForgetYou"" at the closing ceremony, with Paloma Faith, who was nominated for ""British Best Female Artist,"" as his collaborator. At the previous Grammy night, he just performed the song with Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow. Also performing were The Corrs, Manfred Mann’s Earth Band, Tinie Tempah, Rihanna, who won the award for “Best Female Artist International,” and Avril Lavigne and Adele, who did not receive nominations but gave great performances. Avril, Cheryl Cole, and Dizzee Rascal also served as presenters. Linden/Wen"

女儿卖房搬家照顾患病母亲【新民网·独家报道】自从老母亲因脑溢血倒下，54岁的蔡娅荣早出晚归照顾82岁的老母亲已经4年了。在外人眼中，蔡女士是个孝女。在自己眼中，她是为了弥补父亲脑溢血弥留之际自己未陪伴左右的遗憾。母亲节之际，当蔡女士接受新民网记者采访时，她连连自谦不值得采访，“我自己也是个母亲，这些都是应该做的。”4年前，蔡女士的母亲徐阿婆因突发脑溢血病倒，自那之后的2年，蔡女士往返于黄浦区和长宁区。“妈别人不认，虽然请了保姆，但还是只认我。我不来，她饭也不吃。为了照顾母亲，我几乎2年没回家。”2年前，蔡女士为了照顾方便，将黄浦区制造局路的房子卖掉，置换到了长宁区。蔡女士说，如今她只要花10分钟就可以往返其母亲家，每天则要在母亲家待上12个小时左右。蔡女士是家中长女，父亲在20年前因脑溢血过世，在那之前，蔡女士家的新生命诞生。蔡女士自述，因生养小孩，没在父亲床前多照顾，至今视为遗憾。4年前，当母亲徐阿婆也因脑溢血倒下，弟弟工作繁忙，蔡女士就挑起了照顾母亲的重任。徐阿婆因脑溢血而导致行动不便，根据医生说法，脑溢血病人很容易生褥疮，但徐阿婆却没有，可见照顾周到。时值今日，蔡女士仍在每天行使照料之职，而徐阿婆情况时好时坏，认不出人时，会叫蔡女士“姐姐”。接受采访时，蔡女士一直笑谈自己没什么特别，不值得采访。但这个普通的上海女人，却用平凡的力量，赢得了周围人的赞誉。(新民网记者萧君玮)	蔡娅荣,蔡女士,徐阿婆,黄浦,萧君玮	正向	"Daughter sells house and moves to take care of her sick mother [Xinmin.com, exclusive report] Since her 82-year-old mother fell due to cerebral hemorrhage, Cai Ya Rong, 54, has been taking care of her mother for 4 years. To outsiders, Mrs. Cai is a filial daughter. In her own eyes, she was to make up for the regret of not accompanying her father during his last moments when he had a cerebral hemorrhage. When Ms. Cai was interviewed by the new Minwang website on Mother's Day, she modestly said that she was not worthy of being interviewed. ""I am also a mother, and all of these are what I should do."" Four years ago, Mrs. Cai’s mother, Xu Apou, fell ill due to a sudden cerebral hemorrhage. For the following two years, Mrs. Cai has been traveling between Huangpu District and Changning District. ""Mum, others don't recognize me. Although I hired a nanny, she still only recognizes me."" She won't eat her meal if I don't come. To take care of my mother, I didn't go back home for nearly two years. Miss Cai sold the house on Manufacturing Bureau Road in Huangpu District two years ago for the convenience of care and exchanged it for one in Changning District. Mrs. Cai said that it now takes her only 10 minutes to travel to her mother’s home, and she stays there for about 12 hours a day. Mrs. Cai is the eldest daughter in the family. Her father passed away due to a cerebral hemorrhage 20 years ago, before which there was a new life in the Cai family. Mrs. Cai said that she felt regretful for not taking good care of her father when she gave birth to a child. Four years ago, when Mrs. Xu, her grandmother, fell ill due to a cerebral hemorrhage, and her brother was busy with work, Ms. Cai took on the responsibility of taking care of her grandmother. Xu A-pou was inconvenient in movement due to cerebral hemorrhage. According to the doctor, cerebral hemorrhage patients are very likely to develop bedsores, but Xu A-pou did not, which shows that she was well taken care of. Today, Mrs. Cai still takes care of Xu Abo every day, and Xu Abo's condition is sometimes good and sometimes bad, and when she does not recognize people, she calls Mrs. Cai ""sister"". When interviewed, Mrs. Cai always joked that she was not special and was not worth interviewing. But this ordinary Shanghai woman won the praise of those around her with her ordinary power.

According to the new快报讯 (New快报讯), the reporter Huang Qiong and intern Ma Xuecan, as well as the reporters Lin Jingbiao and Li Xiang of the same organization, the man used a dedicated payment website to attract more than 4,000 members from home and abroad to make a profit of over 2 million yuan. On the afternoon of the previous day, Huang, the operator of the website, was publicly tried for the crime of profiting from the reproduction and dissemination of obscene materials at the Intermediate People's Court of Jiangmen. The membership fee for the mainland members is 190 yuan per month. According to the public prosecution authority, in 2005, defendant Huang Mou wrote the ""girldv adult movie website"" web page program on his computer at home in Pengjiang District, Jiangmen City, and purchased a website domain from the ""www.namecheap.com"" website, and then rented a server on the Internet. Huang used Bit Sprite download tool (i.e., BT) to download more than 1000 pornographic movies from the “forum.fdzone.org” website, then cut the above movie files into 3600 video files, and later uploaded them to the pornographic movie website he established for users to download for a fee. In order to make huge profits, Huang Mou developed website members through a membership registration system. Huang Mou collected membership fees from mainland members through the Shenzhen NPS payment platform at 190 yuan per month, and collected membership fees from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas members through the ""VEROTEL"" payment platform at 30 US dollars per month. By the time of the incident, Huang Mou had developed a total of 4,354 network registered members (times), of which 568 members were still in use. The server was not exempt from liability abroad. Yesterday in court, Huang admitted to the charges, saying that he had previously worked in the promotion of the NPS payment platform in Shenzhen, and later found that adult films had a good market and were profitable, so he decided to get involved. After the website was established, it was not specially promoted, and most of the members joined by themselves after searching online. And the defense argued that Huang’s website was hosted in the US, and that such behavior would not be punished in the local area, so they requested leniency in the punishment.

女子昏迷中疑被男友砍掉手掌(组图)穿着黄色羽绒服的小文(化名)坐在哥哥(昆明)家中，两眼紧盯着茶几上的两张照片，照片是她和男友的合影。“看似一个老实人，没想到他这么凶残，居然把我的右手给砍掉了。”小文低沉的言语中透着愤怒。昨日中午，来自曲靖会泽的小文及其家人，跟记者讲述了小文的不幸遭遇。■讲述昏迷醒后右手不见了小文坐在沙发上，努力回忆着今年2月9日晚发生的事情。当晚8点到11点，男友几次打电话要求见小文，小文均表示“我还在上班”。深夜里，男友突然来到她宿舍，并强行把小文拉到1公里外的环西桥大观河观景台边。男友问：“过年了，一起回家行不行？”小文说：“年三十才放假，我要过了年才回去。”两人坐在观景台大石头上，没有吵架。沉默了许久后，大概在次日凌晨零点过点，小文说：“我要回住处了！”起身准备离开。但男友表示：“还没说好，你就要走！”紧接着，令小文意想不到的一幕出现了，对方一把将小文推下了1米多高的石坎，致使其后脑左侧撞在石头上，昏了过去。当小文醒来后，就看见警察和120医生在身旁。“当时，立马感到右手太痛了，在旁人提醒下我才发现自己的整个右手没了。”哥哥没找到妹妹的手小文哥哥说：“当天凌晨，我们是接到警方的电话才知道妹妹出事了。当我们赶到云南协和医院门口时已是凌晨1点半，全身是血的妹妹躺在急救车上睡着了，但伤口惨不忍睹。之后，妹妹被转到云南省第三人民医院医治，一直住到2月24日才出院。”看着妹妹的右手，哥哥非常伤心，“骨头都被砍碎了，当晚我就开着车来到环西桥观景台，开着车灯，和警察一起找了半个小时，现场只看到两大摊血渍，没有找到妹妹的右手。我们还猜测，他(妹妹男友)是不是把妹妹的手扔到河里去了或是带走了？从事情发生后，他的手机就打不通了，老家也没发现他的踪影。”小文哥哥说：“昆明市公安局西山分局东陆桥派出所民警于2月10日下午4点来医院，对妹妹进行了询问。上周，他到派出所询问案子的进展情况，警方答复还没发现嫌疑人踪迹，仍在查找中。”家人盼着警方尽快破案小文的家人说：“他既然做了事情，就应该面对现实，敢于承担自己所造成的后果和该负的责任，怎能一跑了之呢！”事情发生后，小文哥哥迅速将狠心男的照片进行复印，发到亲朋好友手中，请帮忙寻找。“希望警方能早日抓到凶手，将凶手绳之于法！”小文哥哥说。昨日，记者向西山公安分局东陆桥派出所电话询问此案，民警答复确有此事，但案件正在进一步调查之中。■回忆相亲媒婆牵线结识男友在小文及家人的讲述中，记者得知小文和男友是通过相亲认识的。在父母和哥哥眼中，小文是一个温柔的女孩。去年元宵节刚过，到了谈婚论嫁年龄的小文第一次表示愿意相亲。正月十六下午，媒婆就领着一名伙子来到她家。初次见面，小文和父母对话语不多的伙子有了第一印象：本分老实。随后，父母收了对方送来的酒、茶等薄礼，就算同意两人交往了。父母对女儿说：“你感觉好，就处处，我们完全随你的意思。”小文有点害羞，点了点头。从那以后，两人开始了恋爱。男方相当主动，频频打电话给小文。反感男友频频催着结婚去年2月，小文和男友来到昆明打工。男友给别人开车，小文则在一个餐厅做起了服务员。由于两人所住地点相距有点远，到休息日，经常都是男友来餐厅附近和小文见面。除了一起在外面吃点东西外，男友并没有多少话语。随着时间推移，可能是男友觉得是到谈婚论嫁的时候了，其父母便到小文家中商量结婚事宜，但小文父母仍然坚持要尊重女儿的意见。没想到，此后男友次次见面都提同样的问题，这让小文越来越反感。分手男友就是不同意去年8月的一天晚上，男友约小文见面并再一次催促结婚。这一次，小文想了又想，终于说：“我们两个不合适，还是分手吧！”男友沉默了片刻后说，“我不同意！我有什么毛病可以改的。”两个没有说到一块，当晚不欢而散。直到今年1月，就在小文不接电话和接触机会越来越少的情况下，男方仍然对小文说：“我们还是和好吧，继续相处下去！”并告诉小文，一起回家过年，过完年，把结婚的事办了，但被小文拒绝了。小文说：“继续相处下去，我不会开心，以后也不会幸福，还是分手吧。”听到这个答复，男友只是连连叹气。□首席记者吕世成(春城晚报)	小文,昆明,妹妹,吕世成	负向	"A girl, Wen (pseudonym), wearing a yellow down jacket, sat in her brother's (Kunming) home, staring at two photos on the coffee table, which were photos of her and her boyfriend. She was suspected of being hacked by her boyfriend while she was unconscious. He seemed like a decent person, but I didn't expect him to be so ruthless, actually chopping off my right hand. The low voice of Xiaowen was full of anger. On the noon of the previous day, Xiaowen from Huize in Qujing and her family told the journalists about Xiaowen's unfortunate experience. ■ Xiao Wen, who sat on the sofa, was trying to recall what happened on the night of February 9 this year after she woke up from a coma and found her right hand missing. From 8 to 11 that evening, the boyfriend called several times to ask to see Xiaowen, who said ""I'm still at work"" each time. Late at night, her boyfriend suddenly came to her dormitory and forcibly dragged Xiaowen to the West Ring Bridge Scenic Observation Platform by the Guangguan River, which is 1 kilometer away. Boyfriend asked, ""Is it okay if we go home for the New Year?"" Xiaowen said, ""I won't have a holiday until the New Year's Eve, so I will go back after the New Year."" The two of them sat on a big rock on the viewing platform without quarreling. After a long silence, probably around 12:30 in the early hours of the next morning, Xiaowen said, ""I'm going back to my accommodation!"" Get up to prepare to leave. But the boyfriend said, ""You are leaving without even saying goodbye!"" Then, to Wen Xiao’s surprise, the other party pushed her down a stone slope more than one meter high, causing her to hit her left occipital against the stone and pass out. When Xiaowen woke up, she saw the police and the 120 doctors by her side. At that time, I immediately felt a sharp pain in my right hand. It was only when someone else reminded me that I realized my entire right hand was gone. Brother didn't find his sister's hand. Brother said, ""We only found out that my sister had an accident that night when the police called us."" When we arrived at the entrance of Yunnan United Hospital at 1:30 in the morning, my sister, who was covered in blood, was sleeping on the ambulance, but her wounds were terrible to look at. Then, the sister was transferred to the Third People's Hospital of Yunnan Province for treatment, and she stayed there until she was discharged on February 24. Looking at his sister's right hand, the elder brother was very sad, ""The bones were all broken. That night, I drove to the West Ring scenic spot and turned on the car lights to look for the police for half an hour. There was only a large pool of blood at the scene, but I did not find my sister's right hand. We also guessed whether he (his sister's boyfriend) had thrown his sister into the river or taken her away? After the incident, his phone was unreachable, and there was no trace of him in his hometown. Brother Xiaowen said that the police of Donglu Bridge Police Station, Xishan Branch of Kunming Public Security Bureau came to the hospital for an inquiry with his sister at 4 p.m. on February 10. Last week, he went to the police station to inquire about the progress of the case. The police replied that no trace of the suspect had been found and that they were still searching. Family members are looking forward to the police solving the case as soon as possible. Xiao Wen's family said, ""Since he has done something, he should face reality, dare to take responsibility for the consequences and responsibilities caused by himself, how can he run away!"" After the incident, Xiao Wen's brother quickly made copies of the cruel man's photo and distributed them to relatives and friends, asking for help in finding him. Hope the police can catch the murderer and bring him to justice as soon as possible! Said Xiao Wen's big brother. Yesterday, the reporters called the Dongluqiao Police Station of Xishan Public Security Bureau to inquire about the case. The police officer replied that the case was indeed there, but the case was still under further investigation. ■Recalling the matchmaker who introduced her boyfriend, Xiao Wen and her family told the reporter that Xiao Wen and her boyfriend met through a matchmaking service. To her parents and brother, Xiaowen is a gentle girl. After the Lantern Festival last year, Xiaowen, who was at the age of marriage, expressed for the first time that she was willing to date. On the afternoon of the sixteenth day of the first lunar month, the matchmaker led a young man to her home. At the first meeting, Xiaowen and his parents had their first impression of the boy who spoke little to them: honest and down-to-earth. Then, after the parents accepted the thin gifts of wine and tea that the other party brought, they agreed that the two could date. The parents said to their daughter, ""Do as you feel like, we will follow your will completely."" Xiaowen was a little shy and nodded. Since then, the two have been dating. The man was very proactive, calling Xiao Wen frequently. Dislike her boyfriend urging to get married frequently. Last February, Xiaowen and her boyfriend came to Kunming to work. Her boyfriend was driving for someone else, while Xiaowen worked as a waiter in a restaurant. Since the two people live quite far apart, on weekends, it is often the boyfriend who comes to the restaurant to meet Xiaowen. Besides eating something together outside, the boyfriend did not say much. As time went by, it might be that the boyfriend thought it was time to talk about marriage, and his parents went to Xiao Wen's home to discuss marriage matters, but Xiao Wen's parents still insisted on respecting their daughter's opinion. Unexpectedly, after that, her boyfriend brought up the same question every time they met, which made Xiaowen increasingly annoyed. The ex-boyfriend asked Xiaowen to meet him one evening in August last year and urged her to get married again. This time, Xiaowen thought and thought, and finally said, ""We are not suitable for each other, let's break up!"" After a moment of silence, his boyfriend said, ""I disagree!"" What are the problems I can correct. They did not see eye to eye and parted ways unhappily that night. Until January this year, when Wenwen's chances of getting in touch with him and answering his calls were getting fewer and fewer, the man still said to Wenwen, ""Let's get back together and continue to be together!"" And told Xiaowen to go home for the New Year together, and after the New Year, get married, but was rejected by Xiaowen. Xiaowen said, ""If we continue to be together, I won't be happy, and I won't be happy in the future either. Let's break up."" Hearing this reply, the boyfriend just sighed repeatedly. □ Chief Reporter Lü Shicheng (Chuncheng Evening News)"

Sina does not guarantee its authenticity and objectivity. All relevant information about the stock, as announced by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, should be referred to, and investors are advised to pay attention to the risks.  Orient Securities Xu Jianhua, Zhang Lei, Yang Baofeng's mid-term performance has declined significantly year-on-year, and the stock price has already reflected this in advance. EPS for the first half of the year was 0.013 yuan, down 81.4% year-on-year, mainly due to the slow recovery process of the domestic titanium industry, which is still in the bottom, and the company's product sales structure has not improved significantly, and the product sales are still concentrated in the consumer goods market with lower gross profit margin. Recent stock price movements have fully reflected the pressure of significantly lower earnings. Since June, the company's stock price has lagged the market by 30%, reflecting the twists and turns of the industry's recovery from the bottom and the expectation of a significant decline in the mid-year report. The overseas titanium market is recovering strongly, and it is expected that the company's export orders for aerospace titanium materials will gradually recover from the second half of the year. A series of announcements from Boeing this year have shown a strong recovery in the titanium industry - such as the successful maiden flight of the Dreamliner 787, the expected delivery at the end of the year, and three consecutive announcements in the past four months to accelerate production of multiple models of its aircraft in the next two years. We believe that the export of the company's aerospace titanium materials will soon recover as the overseas titanium market continues to recover. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, the demand of China's titanium industry will enter a new era of explosive growth, and the company, as the leader of the domestic titanium material industry, will fully benefit. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, the demand for titanium in China’s national economy, including aerospace, shipbuilding and offshore oil and gas extraction, as well as medical and sports leisure, will enter a new development period. The large aircraft project, Chang'e program, aircraft carrier and new generation fighter, marine engineering, nuclear power plant plan and other projects will gradually enter the period of explosive growth in the demand for titanium materials. As the leading player in the domestic titanium industry, the company should fully benefit. Upgrade to Buy rating. Based on the prediction of the price of sponge titanium per ton at 60,000, 80,000 and 100,000 yuan per ton in 2010-2012, the EPS in 2010-2012 are 0.19 yuan, 0.69 yuan and 1.31 yuan respectively. We maintain our profit forecast unchanged and upgrade our rating to ""Buy"" with a target price of 33 yuan. There are two main reasons: one is the valuation advantage. Recent sharp declines in stock prices have led to a current PB ratio of only 2.4 times, ranking third from the bottom among more than 60 metal and non-metal companies listed in China, and also at a low valuation range in the company's historical valuation. We believe that such a low PB ratio has already fully reflected the expectation of a depressed industry. The export of aviation titanium materials by the Second Company is expected to recover soon, mainly benefiting from the strong recovery of the overseas aviation industry. Over the long and medium term, looking at 12-18 months, we believe that once the domestic titanium industry experiences a strong recovery, referring to the PB operation path of international titanium giants TIE and RTI, Baotie's PB is also expected to return to the level before the financial crisis in the first half of 2008, that is, around 4 times."
时评话题：寒假作业批不批家长教师各有理21日，不少中小学生开始返校，上交寒假作业。一些家长反映，这些作业交上去，教师往往不作批改，这种“只做不批”现象是对孩子不负责。部分教师则认为，假期作业的本意是让孩子温习知识点，没必要全部批改。寒假作业是否应批改？家长、教师各有道理。家长：不批改如何知效果？“寒假作业也是正常的教学环节之一，老师有责任监控。”家长娄先生认为，寒假作业的作用，是让孩子温故知新，在假期玩乐中，别忘记“学习状态”。既然教师布置了作业，孩子完成情况怎么样，肯定要通过批改来进行监控，否则作业的作用不就落空了？家长钱先生认为，寒假作业老师不批改，可能会打击孩子的学习积极性。钱先生女儿从小就特别认真，寒假里，日记一篇不落，《寒假生活》一丝不苟。如今中小学学业评价中包括日常学习态度一项，若老师认真批改寒假作业，起码能看出孩子的学习态度。但老师不批，孩子的努力就无法得到肯定。有些贪玩的孩子缺乏自制力，需要家长天天盯着做作业。如果这些孩子知道老师并不重视寒假作业，甚至并不批改，那他们明年还会认真去完成寒假作业吗？这样岂不会形成“老师应付学生、学生应付老师”的恶性循环？家长伍先生还提出，批改作业既是对学生学习效果的了解，同时也是对老师教学的反馈。只有批改作业，才能发现哪些地方是难点，哪些问题全班普遍存在、需要调整教学。教师：孩子“自检”有助自主但有些教师认为，寒假作业全部批改，既无时间、又无必要，部分作业完全可以“自检”，教师有选择地批改寒假作业，并不影响反馈效果。某小学语文教师透露，今年刚过完春节就开学，备课时间十分紧张。她带的两个班里有70名同学，《寒假生活》、周记和读书笔记等若全部批改，至少需要两周，到时再反馈为时过晚。因此，常规办法只批改重要的作业，如读书笔记等，一本本仔细批改，并及时给学生反馈。“这样既有效率，又了解了寒假作业的效果评估和反馈。”“不少简单的、机械抄写的题目，教师不批改，并不影响反馈效果。”市实验性示范性高中的吕老师认为，《寒假生活》是为了让学生“温故知新”，正确答案已附在后面，孩子自己对一对，或者家长辅导一下即可。而且《寒假生活》过于简单，即使教师批改，也发现不了多少有价值的问题，不如“放权”让学生自查或互查，反而有助于培养其自觉性。也有教师认为，读书笔记、参观学习活动等，重在鼓励孩子静心读书或参与实践，无论读后感、实践报告水平高低，孩子在此体验过程中都会有所收获，何须教师检查、批改？	娄先生,钱先生,伍先生,吕老师	正向	"Opinion: Whether to Grade Students' Winter Vacation Homework: Parents and Teachers Have Their Own Reasons. On the 21st, many middle and primary school students returned to school and submitted their winter vacation homework. Some parents have reported that teachers often do not correct the homework submitted by students, and this phenomenon of ""doing without correcting"" is irresponsible towards the children. Some teachers believe that the original intention of holiday homework is to help children review the knowledge points, and there is no need to correct all of them. Should winter vacation homework be corrected? Parents and teachers have their own reasons. Parent: How can we know the effect without correction? The winter vacation homework is also one of the normal teaching links, and the teacher has the responsibility to monitor it. Mr. Lou, a parent, believes that the role of winter vacation homework is to help children review and learn new things, and not to forget the ""learning state"" in the fun of the holiday. Since the teacher has assigned homework, how the child completes it must be monitored through grading, otherwise the purpose of the homework will be lost. Mr. Qian, the parent, believes that not correcting the winter vacation homework by the teacher may demotivate the child's enthusiasm for learning. Mr. Qian's daughter has always been very serious since she was young, and she did not miss a single diary during the winter vacation, and The Winter Vacation Life was done with great care. Now, in the evaluation of primary and secondary school studies, there is a daily study attitude, and if the teacher is serious about correcting the winter vacation homework, at least it can show the child's attitude towards learning. But if the teacher does not approve, the child’s efforts will not be recognized. Some children who are a bit playful lack self-control and need their parents to supervise them to do their homework every day. Will these children finish their winter vacation homework seriously next year if they know that the teacher does not attach importance to it and does not even correct it? Wouldn't this create a vicious cycle of teachers catering to students and students catering to teachers? Mr. Wu, the parent, also proposed that correcting homework is not only an understanding of students' learning effects, but also a feedback on teachers' teaching. Only by grading homework can we find out where the difficulties lie and what problems are common to the whole class and need to be adjusted in teaching. Teachers: Children's ""self-inspection"" is helpful for self-management, but some teachers believe that it is neither time-efficient nor necessary to correct all the winter vacation homework. Some homework can be ""self-inspected"", and teachers can choose to correct the winter vacation homework without affecting the feedback effect. A primary school Chinese language teacher revealed that the school started after the Spring Festival this year, and the preparation time for lessons was very tight. She has two classes with 70 students. If she were to correct all of the Winter Vacation Life, weekly essays, and reading notes, it would take at least two weeks, and feedback would be too late by then. Thus, the routine approach is to only correct important assignments, such as reading notes, carefully correcting them book by book, and providing timely feedback to students. This is both efficient and helps understand the effectiveness and feedback of the winter vacation homework. A large number of simple, mechanically copied questions, without teachers' correction, do not affect the feedback effect. Teacher Lu from the Experimental Demonstration High School in the city believes that ""Winter Vacation Life"" is to enable students to ""review old knowledge and gain new insights"", and the correct answers are attached at the back. Children can check them themselves or ask their parents for some guidance. And The Winter Vacation Life is too simple, and even if the teacher corrects it, few valuable problems can be found. It is better to ""delegate"" the students to self-examine or peer-examine, which is more conducive to cultivating their initiative. Some teachers also believe that reading notes, field trips, and other activities are meant to encourage children to read quietly or participate in practice. Regardless of the quality of the reading notes or practice reports, children will gain something from this experience. Why do teachers need to check and correct them?"

小伙为减压晚上化妆成女生出门称自己绝不变性傍晚时分，一名男子走进了太湖路的一家理发店。“老板，还和以前一样。”老板刘女士会意地点点头，拿出一瓶收敛水，仔细地往男子脸上抹，过了10分钟，刘女士开始清除男子脸上凝固的收敛水，为男子打粉底、涂腮红、画眉、粘睫毛，再仔细地涂上眼影、眼线、抹口红。男子拿出一个乌黑柔顺的假发套，让刘女士帮忙戴好，随后又钻进隔壁的小房间换衣服。20分钟后，一个长发飘飘，上身着红色短外套，下身穿黑色超短裙、黑色丝袜，脚踩黑色短靴，手挎粉红色包包的时尚“美眉”走出了理发店。李玉刚让他爱上“变装”的感觉男子名叫路成(化名)，25岁，合肥人。1月14日晚上，他以一身时尚的女装出现在合肥寒冷的街头。路成说：“我是特意去理发店弄的，他们专业的效果会好很多，平时我都是自己化，半个小时也能搞定。”路成“变装”缘起一次偶然的机会，他在电视上看到了身穿女装的李玉刚，感觉很“惊艳”，“太美了，我感觉很艺术。”那时路成正和前女友处在甜蜜期，趁女友不在，他会偷偷翻出女友的衣服和鞋子试穿，后来对女友的化妆品、包包也发生了兴趣。女友得知他的爱好后，并没有强烈制止，只是告诉他不要玩得太过火，所以他后来在女友面前也敢公开穿女装了，甚至在晚上化妆成女生，和女友一起出门逛街。“那时候都是偶尔穿下，纯粹是觉得女装好看，穿着觉得很好玩。”路成告诉记者。他说自己穿女装只是为了减压2007年，路成找到了现在这份在饭店的工作，开始了一个普通打工者的生活。然而长期劳累的工作加上单调的生活方式，让他渐感厌倦。寂寞和苦闷得不到宣泄，他只能靠上网来打发本就不多的闲暇时间。时间长了，路成在网上发现了一个特殊的群体，他们都是年轻男子，都喜欢白天男装，晚上则以女性形象示人。路成感觉找到了“组织”，后来他又在这个群体找到了现在的室友，两人成为了好朋友。现在，路成把合肥市有同类爱好的人加进了一个QQ群，自己担任群主，室友是管理员。“工作、生活、家庭的压力太大了，可能每个人减压的方式不一样，我们就通过穿女装的方式来排解压力，而且还可以展示自己的美，何乐而不为呢？”路成颇为自豪地告诉记者，自己身高168cm、体重104斤的身材走在街上很有“女人味”。14日晚上，记者和路成一同走进了多家饰品店、服装店，没有一位老板认出他是男儿身，一位老板甚至卖力地向他推销起女用化妆品。他的梦想是成为一名导游路成毕业于一所旅游学校，当导游一直是他的梦想。但毕业时，他的父亲刚好去世，而找一份导游的工作又并非易事，迫于现实的压力，他去了一家饭店工作。2008年下半年，他遇到了前女友，但后来还是分手了。“我准备明年辞职。”路成说，他想向导游的方向努力。现在的他正在努力攒钱，准备为以后打拼。而说起他心里完美的女孩，路成说没有特别的要求，“理解我，能过日子的就行。”他说自己是纯爷们绝不变性“我对自己的男性身份绝对认同，毫不犹豫地认同。”说起前段时间引起很多人关注的合肥“著姐”做变性手术的事，路成说可以理解他们想成为一名女性的心情，但不会跟风。路成说自己穿女装、化妆纯粹是为了好玩和减压，自己绝不会去做变性手术，在找到新女友之后，他会不再穿女装，“因为要考虑她的感受。”“男人就要承担自己的责任。”路成有两个哥哥、两个姐姐，都已经成家立业了。父亲去世后，家里就剩下60多岁的母亲。“每年过年我都会回去和我妈过，买年货、做年夜饭都是我的活。”心理专家：应有正确减压途径“这种减压方式目前还不被社会认同，时间长了很容易引起心理疾病。”针对像路成一样有“变装”爱好的群体，合肥新健康职业培训学校心理咨询师张建军告诉记者，每一个有独特爱好的人刚开始都是抱着猎奇的心理去尝试一些不为社会认同的行为，时间久了就会欲罢不能，而强大的社会排斥又让其时时感到压抑，如果这种压抑得不到正确的宣泄，往往会给当事人造成心理问题。“像路成这种已有两三年爱穿女装的经历，已经是异装癖的症状，是一种不正确的减压方式。”作者：甘琼芳郑蕊	刘女士,李玉刚,路成,路成正,张建军,甘琼芳,郑蕊	正向	"The young man, to relieve stress, put on female makeup at night and went out, claiming that he would never change his gender. In the evening, a man walked into a barber shop on Taihu Road. Boss, it's still the same as before. Miss Liu nodded in understanding and took out a bottle of astringent water, carefully applying it to the man's face. After 10 minutes, Miss Liu began to remove the astringent water that had solidified on the man's face, and then applied foundation, blush, drew eyebrows, and applied false eyelashes. She then carefully applied eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick. The man took out a black and silky wig and asked Miss Liu to help him put it on. Then he went into the next small room to change clothes. 20 minutes later, a fashionable ""girl"" with long hair, wearing a red short coat, black mini skirt, black stockings, and black short boots, and carrying a pink bag, walked out of the hair salon. Li Yuguang made him fall in love with the feeling of ""cross-dressing"". The man's name is Lu Cheng (a pseudonym), 25 years old, from Hefei. On the evening of January 14, he appeared on the cold street of Hefei in a fashionable women's outfit. Lu Cheng said, ""I went to the barber shop specially, their professional effect will be much better, usually I do it myself, and it can be done in half an hour."" “Lu Cheng” started to “transform” because of a chance opportunity, he saw Li Yuguang wearing women's clothes on TV, and felt very ""stunning"", ""too beautiful, I feel very artistic."" At that time, Lu Chengzheng and his ex-girlfriend were in a sweet period. When his girlfriend was not around, he would secretly try on his girlfriend's clothes and shoes. Later, he also developed an interest in his girlfriend's cosmetics and handbags. After his girlfriend learned of his hobbies, she did not strongly stop him, but only told him not to play too much, so he later dared to wear women's clothes in front of his girlfriend, even put on makeup as a girl and went out shopping with his girlfriend at night. Back then, I would only wear it occasionally, just because I thought it looked good and it was fun to wear. Lu Cheng told the reporter. He said that he wore women's clothes just to relieve stress. In 2007, Lu Cheng found a job in a restaurant and began a life as an ordinary worker. However, the long-term hard work and monotonous lifestyle gradually made him feel bored. With his loneliness and depression having nowhere to vent, he could only pass the limited leisure time by going online. Over time, Lu Cheng discovered a special group on the Internet. They were all young men who liked to wear men's clothing during the day and appear as women at night. Lu Cheng felt he had found an ""organization"", and later he found his current roommate in this group, and the two became good friends. Now, Lu Cheng has added people in Hefei who have similar hobbies into a QQ group, and he is the group owner, while his roommate is the administrator. Work, life, and family pressures are too great. Maybe everyone has different ways to relieve stress. We choose to relieve stress by wearing women's clothes, and we can also show our beauty. Why not? Lu Cheng, who is 168 cm tall and weighs 104 pounds, is quite proud of the fact that she has a feminine figure when walking on the street. On the evening of the 14th, the reporter and Lu Cheng walked into several jewelry stores and clothing stores together, and none of the bosses recognized that he was a man. One boss even tried to sell him women's cosmetics with great enthusiasm. His dream is to become a tour guide, he graduated from a tourism school, and being a tour guide has always been his dream. But when he graduated, his father just happened to pass away, and it was not easy to find a job as a tour guide. Under the pressure of reality, he went to work in a hotel. In the second half of 2008, he met his ex-girlfriend, but they eventually broke up. I am planning to resign next year. Lu Cheng said that he wanted to strive in the direction of the tour guide. He is now working hard to save money to fight for the future. When it comes to the perfect girl in his heart, Lu Cheng said that there were no special requirements, ""Just understand me and be able to get along with others."" He said he was a real man and would never change his sexual orientation. I fully and unhesitatingly identified with my own masculinity. When Lu Cheng talked about the recent case of Zhuo Sister in Hefei who underwent a sex change operation, he said that he could understand their desire to become a woman, but he would not follow the trend. Lu Cheng said that he wore women's clothes and made up purely for fun and to relieve stress, and he would never do a sex change operation. After finding a new girlfriend, he would no longer wear women's clothes, ""because he had to consider her feelings."" A man must take responsibility for his own actions. Lu Cheng has two brothers and two sisters, who are all married and have established their careers. After the father's death, there was only a mother in her sixties at home. Every year during the Spring Festival, I go back to spend it with my mother. Buying New Year's goods and making the New Year's Eve dinner are my responsibilities. Psychologists: There should be proper ways to relieve stress. This kind of stress relief is not yet recognized by society, and it is easy to cause mental illness after a long time. For those like Lu Cheng who have a “cross-dressing” hobby, Zhang Jianjun, a psychological counselor from Hefei New Health Vocational Training School, told reporters that everyone who has a unique hobby initially tries to experience some behavior that is not recognized by society out of a sense of curiosity. After a long time, they become addicted and the strong social exclusion makes them feel depressed all the time. If this depression cannot be properly released, it often causes psychological problems for the person involved. Like Lu Cheng, who has had the experience of wearing women's clothes for two or three years, it is a symptom of transvestism, an incorrect way to relieve stress. Author: Gan Qiongfang Zheng Rui"

奥尼尔斗志动摇退役倒计时鲨鱼一数据和乔丹并列新浪体育讯　整个夏天，奥尼尔都泡在了南佛罗里达，在迈阿密和奥兰多，有他的房产以及曼妙的沙滩———菲尼克斯的沙漠和燥热实在不讨“鲨鱼”喜欢。但是很快，沙克就可以自由地选择生活。在当地时间上周三，他在接受佛罗里达新闻13频道采访时列出了退役的时间表，也就是到2009-2010赛季结束。届时，他在昔日与热火签订的5年1亿美金合同履罄。沙克在说这番话时语调轻松，他在畅想两年后的快意生活：警察故事，说唱音乐，选餐时不再考虑卡路里……但是未来两年，对于沙克来说，将是被失败和老迈所包裹的两年，而对观者来说，看着这条搅动联盟格局近20年的“鲨鱼”一天一天老去，又难免会心生唏嘘。无欲所以归去13频道的主持人访问沙克时并没有想到会有这个收获，因为此前的奥尼尔从没有透露过退休计划———如果有，那也是他在吹牛，“我会打到40岁，像贾巴尔那样。”但事实上，他更像张伯伦，36岁的张伯伦，平均得分从一年前20.7分跌至14.8分，一年之后选择退役；39岁的贾巴尔季后赛尚有场均23.4分的贡献。在接受访问时，沙克异常轻松，言谈间似乎充满了对未来的憧憬，“为我倒计时吧，伙计，我的职业生涯还剩735天，然后我会做一个有教养的人。我(退役后)的选择之一就是从事法律实施方面工作，成为一名法律执行官员，最好是当一名警察。”对于沙克此番言论，太阳高层没有任何反应。官方网站上满是纳什、小斯的作秀以及希尔伤势、球票促销之类消息，惟独“漏”了沙克言退这条报道，当地《东谷论坛报》和《亚利桑那共和报》上，也没有总经理斯蒂夫·科尔惯有的高谈阔论。常理分析，沙克言退，即便在全联盟也是个大新闻，但是太阳有意无意选择回避，或许正说明他们内心的不安。年初不惜以当打之年的马里昂去换取老态已显的奥尼尔，被认为是太阳冲刺总冠军的一场豪赌。太阳最终季后赛第一轮就被马刺以4比1淘汰，随后主教练丹东尼东去纽约，意味这场豪赌几成败局。如今沙克早早列出了退役时间表，无疑又释放了一个消极信号———垂垂老矣且不想玩了的“鲨鱼”，已不可能再像以往那样成为砥柱中流。而对沙克本人来说，他对自己在太阳的前程也大抵看了个通透。明后年的他即便能保持上赛季的状态，但在竞争态势“一寸河山一寸血”的西部，太阳也很难为他带来第五枚冠军戒指，因为他身边的希尔、纳什，不比他小多少。当然，沙克也可能被交易———问题是谁愿意承受他2000多万美金的年薪？太阳也可考虑买断沙克———问题是这支球队的老板远没有尼克斯多兰那般阔绰。曾与乔丹争锋今年4月27日，马刺与太阳季后赛的第四战，后者主场经过一番苦战，赢得了这个系列赛惟一一场胜利。这场胜利对于太阳来说，只是关乎颜面，但是对于沙克来说，却是别有一番意义。凭借这场胜利，“鲨鱼”的季后赛胜场追平了乔丹的124场；迄今为止他的季后赛总得分达到5121分，是继贾巴尔和乔丹之后第三位季后赛得分超过5000的统治级球员。沙克并不仅仅在很多统计数据中把名字和乔丹并列，也是乔丹走上神坛(1991年夺冠)之后，第一个真正击败他的人。1994-1995赛季的季后赛，尽管魔术常规赛拿下东部最佳的57胜25负，但真正的主角只能是回归的乔丹以及他的公牛。首轮击败凯尔特人，奥尼尔等来了乔丹，“我终于有机会看看传说中的那个人有多么厉害。”双方在前四场战平。第五场“鲨鱼”在攻防两端继续控制比赛，23分并没什么稀奇，22个篮板中有14个前场篮板，则创造了季后赛常规时间最高值，另有5次封盖，其中两次送给乔丹。魔术赢得了“天王山之战”，并在随后一场解决战斗。自从1991年以来，乔丹只是输过这一次季后赛，若以趣谈，奥尼尔也算是惟一击败过“飞人”的超级中锋。如今，这个联盟惟一留存的超级中锋也在念叨着归去，尽管还有两年时间，但属于沙克的时代，已经无可逃遁般地结束。(航海）	奥尼尔,鲨鱼,乔丹,沙克,贾巴尔,张伯伦,纳什,小斯,希尔,斯蒂夫·科尔,马里昂,丹东尼,多兰	正向	"O'Neal's fighting spirit is shaken, and the countdown to retirement is in progress. The Shark is indifferent to the data in Phoenix, the desert and the heat are not to the Shark's taste. But soon, Shaq could freely choose his life. On Wednesday of last week, he listed his retirement timetable in an interview with WFLA Channel 13, which is to end with the conclusion of the 2009-2010 season. By then, the five-year, $100 million contract he signed with the Heat would have expired. Shaq spoke with a light tone, imagining the pleasant life in two years: police stories, rap music, and no longer worrying about calories when choosing meals. But for Shaq, the next two years would be filled with failure and old age, and for the audience, watching the ""shark"" who has shaken the league for nearly 20 years grow old day by day, it was hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia. Without desire to return, the host of channel 13's interview with Shaq did not expect to get this, because before this, O'Neal had never revealed his retirement plan - if there was, it was just a bluff, ""I will play until 40, like Jabbar."" But in fact, he is more like Chamberlain, 36-year-old Chamberlain, whose average score dropped from 20.7 points last year to 14.8 points, and chose to retire a year later; at 39, Abdul-Jabbar still contributed 23.4 points per game in the playoffs. When interviewed, Shaq was unusually relaxed, and seemed to be full of hope for the future, ""Count down for me, buddy, my career is left with 735 days, and then I will be a cultivated person."" One of my choices after retirement is to work in the implementation of the law, becoming a law enforcement officer, preferably a police officer. For Shaq's remarks, the Suns' upper echelons made no response. The Nash and Stoudemire’s showboating and Hill’s injury and ticket promotions filled the official website, but there was no report of Shaq’s retirement. The local East Valley Tribune and Arizona Republic did not have the usual high talk of the general manager Steve Kerr. Common sense analysis, if Shaq speaks out, it will be a big news even in the entire league, but the Suns choose to avoid it intentionally or unintentionally, which may indicate their inner unease. At the beginning of the year, trading Marion, who was in his prime, for the aging O'Neal was considered a豪赌by the Suns to win the championship. The Suns were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Spurs with a score of 4-1, and then the head coach Dantoni went to New York, which meant that this gamble was almost over. Now that Shaq has early on listed his retirement timetable, he has undoubtedly sent out another negative signal – the “shark” who is old and unwilling to play can no longer be a pillar of support as before. For Shaq himself, he had a clear view of his future with the Suns. If he can maintain his performance from last season in the next two years, the Suns will still find it difficult to bring him a fifth championship ring in the West, where the competition is fierce, because his teammates, Hill and Nash, are not much younger than him. Of course, Shaq could also be traded – the question is who would be willing to take on his salary of over 20 million US dollars? The Suns could also consider buying out Shaq, but the problem is that this team’s owner is not as rich as Dolan of the Knicks. Once in contention with Jordan, on April 27, in the fourth game of the playoffs between the Spurs and the Suns, the latter won the only victory of the series after a hard-fought battle at home. The victory was just about face for the Suns, but it had a different significance for Shaq. With this victory, ""Shark"" tied Jordan's playoff wins at 124; his total playoff points to date stand at 5,121, making him the third all-time playoff scorer to surpass 5,000 points, after Kareem and Jordan. Shaq not only put his name alongside Jordan in many statistical categories, but he was also the first person to truly defeat Jordan after he ascended to the pantheon (in 1991, when Jordan won the championship). The playoffs of the 1994-1995 season, although the Magic won the best record in the East with 57 wins and 25 losses in the regular season, the real protagonist could only be Jordan's return and his Bulls. In the first round, defeating the Celtics, Shaq finally met Jordan, ""I finally had the chance to see how great the legendary man was."" Both sides are level after the first four games. In the fifth game, the “sharks” continued to control the game on both ends of the court, with 23 points and 22 rebounds, 14 of which were offensive rebounds, setting a record for the highest number of offensive rebounds in the regular season of the playoffs, and also had 5 blocks, including two to Jordan. Magic won the ""Game 5"" and then won the series in the following game. Since 1991, Jordan has lost only once in the playoffs, and if you count fun stories, Shaq is the only super center to beat the ""Airman"". Now, the only remaining super center in this league is also muttering about going home, although there are still two years to go, and the era of Shaq has ended in an inescapable way. (Navigation)"
领队：王奉春说了不合适的话“惩罚”并不少见3月5日，中国男子冰壶队队长王奉春出现在北京，和队员一起参加了国家体育总局为温哥华冬奥健儿举行的庆功表彰晚宴。在3月2日自温哥华返京当晚，王奉春曾被告知“暂时离队”，并于当晚便踏上了返回哈尔滨的火车。究竟是什么原因，让中国冰壶队的领队李东岩对王奉春做出了如此处罚？在皆大欢喜之际“调整队员”，李东岩到底出于什么样的目的？3月6日，本报记者就以上问题对李东岩进行了采访。李东岩谈王奉春“被调整”记者：想知道王奉春被调整的原因是什么？李东岩：王奉春被调整只是队伍正常的人员调整，希望这名队员能够回去冷静地思考。记者：是因为他在冬奥会赛场上表现不佳吗？李东岩：关于冬奥会的表现，我觉得没有什么问题，队员们都已经尽力了，男队第一次参加冬奥会比赛能够打到这样的成绩，展现出这样的水平和能力，我觉得没有问题。至于王奉春，他的确没有表现出最佳的水平，从第八场开始，我们用助理教练将王奉春换了下来。但王奉春被调整显然不是因为赛场上的表现。记者：那王奉春被调整的真正原因是什么？李东岩：还是情绪上的影响吧。最后两场他没有上场，心里不太高兴，在一些场合说了不太合适的话。比赛结束后几天内，他一直情绪很低落，大家住在一起，他的这种情绪会影响到其他队友。冰壶是一个集体项目，我们是为了赢球而来，不是要顾忌到哪个人的面子，作为队长，他更应该从全队出发。记者：回国那天让他直接回家，看起来有点残酷。李东岩：这件事也是赶上了，我们在温哥华就做出了决定：回国之后让王奉春先回家调整几天。当天回来的时间有点晚，到了首体就晚上7点20了，其实吃顿饭也没什么，但他的火车是9点钟开，我们肯定不能因为这一顿饭延误火车，就跟他谈了，由于事先不知情，王奉春有点接受不了。记者：那为什么又让王奉春参加了5日的庆功晚宴？李东岩：功是功、过是过。王奉春是中国男子冰壶队参加温哥华冬奥会的成员之一，既然庆功宴是为了表彰为冬奥会作出贡献的代表团成员而举办的，那么王奉春当然应该参加。记者：这是不是意味着他已经回队，并有可能参加即将开始的世锦赛？李东岩：主要还是看他自己的表现，他何时能重返国家队，完全取决于他自己的表现。“付出了那么多年，我真的不希望任何一个队员受罚。但严格管理，这可以说是我们队伍在七年间能够走到今天的一个重要原因，我觉得如果没有这种严格管理的话，队伍不可能具备如此的战斗力。”中国冰壶队领队李东岩如是说。对于王奉春与中国男子冰壶队，李东岩有着难以言说的感情，“比起女队，我对冰壶男队的时间和精力要付出的多得多。2007年他们没打进世锦赛后，如果我选择了放弃，而不是带着他们去比赛、训练，花很多时间放在他们身上，尤其是王奉春身上。他们根本不会走到今天，不会进入到冬奥会的舞台上。”李东岩说。此次对王奉春做出的调整决定，李东岩也很痛心，“作为队长，对王奉春的处理是不得已的，是对别人的一个交代。这是队伍管理的一个范畴”。七年艰辛“严”字当先2003年，中国冰壶队成立，从那一天起，李东岩就开始将自己的全部力量放在冰壶项目上，对于管理，他的态度是坚决的，从来没有因为哪一名队员是重点队员，或者关系的亲疏而有任何差异。借此机会让我们跟随李领队来了解一下冰壶队员的生活状态。首先是严格控制作息时间。李东岩介绍说，队里制定有详细的作息时间表，几点起床，几点出早操，几点吃饭，几点睡觉，都有具体的规定。其次是收电脑、手机。针对冰壶项目的特点，队员们需要有更多时间的交流与融合，中国冰壶队还采取了收电脑和手机的做法。“我们发现队员除了训练，回来之后天天‘捧’着电脑，这不是一件好事。因为有了电脑，大家可以‘打游戏’，看电影，但队员之间的交流就少了”。于是，队伍就制定了收电脑的政策，只在个别时间发给队员使用一段的时间。手机也是如此。从夏训开始，队伍就开始在晚上熄灯之前收缴手机，“一方面是保证大家不受外界影响，同时，也希望不要影响到其他队员的休息。”李东岩解释说。考虑到冰壶的项目特点，队伍在训练与平日的生活中也会根据队员不同的位置培养其责任感，“一垒做什么？二垒做什么？三垒、四垒分别做什么？替补做什么？大家都很明白自己的角色，职责分工”。看似苛刻的规定，队伍的每个人都欣然接受了。原因很简单，因为大家都知道对自己来说，最重要的是什么。“惩罚”事件并不少见李东岩说，王奉春被调整一事在冰壶队并不是首例，之前，这种类似于“惩罚”的事件也曾经发生过。“女孩子喜欢逛街，一到新地方，第一件事就想着逛街。我觉得这不是个很好的事儿，容易分散精力，转移视线。”李东岩说，后来他还真采取了“惩罚”措施，把姑娘们拉到一个超级大商场里，限定两个小时，随便逛，但是没有让任何人带钱包。2008年世锦赛前一个月，李东岩因为发现队里有人起到了不好的作用，临时调整人员，没有其余人员选择的李东岩本人报名，担任替补队员。“和欧洲和北美国家相比，我们的队员有些欠缺，就拿备战来说，其他选手会很明白自己在做什么，该做什么。但我们的队员显然并不了解，也不清楚自己该如何备战。队伍的管理者还需要去给他们留作业，真的有点累。”李东岩说。比队员年长十岁的李东岩并没有和队员打成一片，而是刻意营造了一种距离感，便于队伍管理。再加上从2005年学会了打冰壶，李东岩的训练水平并不差于任何一名队员，在队内比赛中曾赢过队员，对于周妍、岳清爽等队员，他都多多少少给出了一些指导性建议。“2008年世锦赛虽然没上场，但我参与了很多，我和队员们一起商量对策，想出了很多办法，最终拿到了第四名，我觉得非常的过瘾。”李东岩说。	王奉春,李东岩,李领队,周妍,岳清爽	正向	"The leader: Wang Fengchun said inappropriate words, and the ""punishment"" was not rare. On March 5, the captain of the Chinese men's curling team, Wang Fengchun, appeared in Beijing and participated in the celebration and commendation evening party held by the General Administration of Sport for the Vancouver Winter Olympic athletes. Wang Fengchun was informed that he was to temporarily leave the team on the night of March 2 when he returned to Beijing from Vancouver, and he took a train back to Harbin that night. What was the reason that Li Dongyan, the captain of the Chinese curling team, punished Wang Fengchun in such a way? What was Li Dongyan's purpose in ""adjusting the team"" at a time when everyone was happy? On March 6, the reporter interviewed Li Dongyan on the above issues. Li Dongyan talked about Wang Fengchun's ""adjustment"". Journalist: Do you know the reason why Wang Fengchun was adjusted? Li Dongyan: Wang Fengchun's adjustment is just a normal personnel adjustment of the team, and we hope that this player can return to think calmly. Is it because of his poor performance in the Winter Olympics? Li Dongyan: I don't think there is any problem with the performance of the Winter Olympics. The players have already done their best. The men's team has achieved such results for the first time in the Winter Olympics, showing such a level and ability. I don't think there is any problem. As for Wang Fengchun, he did not perform at his best. Starting from the 8th game, we substituted Wang Fengchun with an assistant coach. But Wang Fengchun was obviously not adjusted because of his performance on the field. The reporter asked, what was the real reason for Wang Fengchun's adjustment? Li Dongyan: It must be the impact on emotions. He did not play in the last two matches, which made him a little unhappy, and he said some inappropriate words in some situations. For several days after the competition, he was in low spirits, and his mood affected the other team members who lived together.  Curling is a team event, we come to win, not to consider anyone's face. As the team captain, he should think more about the whole team. The reporter: Let him go straight home on the day he returns, which seems a bit cruel. Li Dongyan: This is also something that happened by chance. In Vancouver, we made the decision that Wang Fengchun would go home to adjust for a few days after returning to China. He returned a bit late that day, and it was already 7:20 p.m. when he arrived at the Capital Gymnasium. Actually, having a meal was nothing, but his train left at 9 p.m. We certainly couldn't delay the train because of this meal, so we talked to him. As we didn't know in advance, Wang Fengchun couldn't accept it. The reporter asked, why was Wang Fengchun invited to the celebratory dinner on the 5th? Li Dongyan: Merit is merit, and demerit is demerit. Wang Fengchun was one of the members of the Chinese men’s curling team who participated in the Vancouver Winter Olympics. Since the victory banquet was held to honor the members of the delegation who made contributions to the Winter Olympics, Wang Fengchun of course should have attended. The reporter: Does this mean that he has returned to the team and may participate in the upcoming World Cup? Li Dongyan: It mainly depends on his own performance. When he can return to the national team depends entirely on his own performance. I really don't want any of the players to be punished after putting in so many years. But strict management, which can be said to be one of the important reasons for our team to reach this point in seven years, I think that without such strict management, the team would not have such combat power. Li Dongyan, the captain of the Chinese curling team, said so. Li Dongyan has an indescribable feeling for Wang Fengchun and the Chinese men's curling team. Compared to the women's team, I have to spend more time and energy on the men's curling team. If I had chosen to give up instead of taking them to the competition and training, spending a lot of time on them, especially Wang Fengchun, after they failed to qualify for the World Championship in 2007. They would never have made it to today, to the Olympic stage. Li Dongyan said. Li Dongyan was also very sad about the adjustment decision made for Wang Fengchun. As the team leader, the handling of Wang Fengchun was unavoidable and a matter of making things right for others. This is a category of team management. Seven years of hardship, ""strict"" first of all. In 2003, the Chinese curling team was established, and from that day on, Li Dongyan began to devote all his strength to the curling project. For management, his attitude was firm, and he never made any difference because a player was a key player or because of the closeness of the relationship. Let us take this opportunity to follow Li, the leader, to get to know the life of curling players. First of all, strictly control the schedule. Li Dongyan introduced that the team has a detailed schedule for rest and activities, including specific times for getting up, morning exercises, meals, and going to bed. Next, collect computers and mobile phones. Given the characteristics of curling, the team members need more time to communicate and integrate, and the Chinese curling team has also adopted the practice of confiscating computers and mobile phones. We found that after training, the players held the computer in their hands every day, which is not a good thing. Because of the computer, people can play games and watch movies, but the communication between team members has decreased. So the team established a policy of collecting computers, which were only issued to team members for a short period of time at certain times. So is the mobile phone. Since the summer training, the team has been confiscating mobile phones before lights out, on the one hand, to ensure that everyone is not affected by the outside world, and on the other hand, to avoid affecting the rest of other players. Li Dongyan explained. Considering the characteristics of curling, the team will also cultivate the sense of responsibility of the players according to their different positions in training and daily life, such as what should the first thrower do? What does the second baseman do? What do third base and fourth base do? What do substitutes do? Everyone is clear about their roles and responsibilities. The seemingly harsh regulations were readily accepted by everyone in the team. The reason is simple, because everyone knows what is most important to themselves. Disciplinary actions are not uncommon, Li Dongyan said. The adjustment of Wang Fengchun is not the first case in the curling team. Such disciplinary actions have also occurred before. Girls like to go shopping, and the first thing they think of when they get to a new place is to go shopping. I think this is not a good thing, easy to distract attention and divert the line of sight. Li Dongyan said that later he really took the measure of punishing the girls by taking them to a huge shopping mall and limiting them to two hours, allowing them to browse freely, but not allowing anyone to bring a wallet. One month before the 2008 World Championship, Li Dongyan, who found that someone in the team was playing a bad role, temporarily adjusted the personnel, and Li Dongyan himself, who had no choice of other personnel, signed up to be a substitute player. Compared with European and North American countries, our players are somewhat lacking. For example, in terms of preparation, other players will clearly know what to do and what to do. But our players clearly do not understand, and do not know how to prepare. The team manager also needs to give them homework, which is really tiring. Li Dongyan said. Li Dongyan, who is ten years older than the team members, did not integrate with the team members but deliberately created a sense of distance to facilitate team management. In addition to learning to play curling in 2005, Li Dongyan's training level is not inferior to that of any team member, and he has even beaten team members in team matches. For Zhou Yan, Yue Qingshuang, and other team members, he has given some instructive suggestions. Though I did not play in the 2008 World Championship, I was involved in a lot of it. I discussed strategies with the team and came up with many ideas, and in the end, we finished fourth. I felt very satisfied. Li Dongyan said."
美股评论：诺基亚的赌注导读：2月11日，诺基亚正式宣布与微软达成全球战略合作伙伴关系，双方将会在智能手机领域进行深度合作。英国《金融时报》2月13日发表的社论就诺基亚与微软结成的战略联盟做出评论，认为诺基亚需要依靠微软的手机系统夺回被苹果和采用安卓系统的手机占领的市场份额。以下是该评论文章翻译：上周，诺基亚和微软宣布将在移动电话方面进行合作。商业联盟在历史上向来没有良好的表现，这可能是投资者对此项合作如此失望的原因。诺基亚希望利用微软的WindowsPhone系统与谷歌的安卓和苹果的iOS系统展开较量。诺基亚不是唯一面临战略问题的公司。虽然苹果的软件和硬件都有上升势头，但微软在个人电脑操作系统领域的支配地位从未被人夺走。然而，微软将其市场影响力向手机方面的转移并不成功。曾任微软高管、现为诺基亚CEO的史蒂芬-埃洛普(StephenElop)在上周两公司宣布合作之前称，诺基亚面临着一个“燃烧着的舞台”。他认为，诺基亚受到中国手机厂商生产的廉价手机和其他智能手机的夹击。诺基亚的困难不仅在此。即便在智能手机领域，诺基亚即将被淘汰的塞班平台也处于一个尴尬的境地，它被iOS和安卓包围。消费者并不像渴求iOS那样渴求塞班的系统，而塞班也缺乏安卓的开放源代码。埃洛普所依靠的是移动电话运营商，而这些机构则发现他们对自己所出售的手机的掌控受到苹果和安卓的挤压。他们想要看到第三家智能手机竞争者的出现，这样便可以与手机供货商就价格和手机的特点展开还价。从纸面上看，诺基亚和微软的战略合作的确有其意义。抛开其他问题不说，两家公司都拥有庞大的资源，且都已下定决心进行回击。诺基亚拒绝减少其研发资金的投入是导致其股价在上周五下跌的原因之一。但是问题是，在幻灯片上看似一致的东西却不能在现实中实现。大型公司之间难以合作的原因是各自有着自己的领域。诺基亚将更多的重心放在了此次合作之上，而微软将会把WindowPhone系统出售给其他手机制造商。航空业和汽车工业领域出现了许多合作，因为想要说服政府进行完全的收购是困难的。然而，相对于收购，企业间的合作仍旧不是首选之策，因为哪家公司控制什么、两家公司应如何合作是很难决断的。正如公司总裁所说，诺基亚希望此项合作会带来其预期的效果。诺基亚一定希望商业联盟的历史不会在他们身上重演。(多杰)	史蒂芬-埃洛普,埃洛普,多杰	正向	US stock market commentary: Nokia's bet: Introduction: On February 11, Nokia officially announced a global strategic partnership with Microsoft, and the two sides will cooperate deeply in the field of smartphones. The Financial Times, in a commentary published on February 13, commented on Nokia’s strategic alliance with Microsoft, arguing that Nokia needs to rely on Microsoft’s mobile phone system to regain market share from Apple and Android phones. The following is the translation of the review article: Last week, Nokia and Microsoft announced that they would cooperate in mobile phones. Business alliances have historically had a poor track record, which may explain investors' disappointment with this collaboration. Nokia hopes to compete with Google's Android and Apple's iOS systems using Microsoft's WindowsPhone system. Nokia is not the only company facing strategic issues. Although Apple’s software and hardware have been on the rise, Microsoft’s dominance in the personal computer operating system market has never been challenged. However, Microsoft’s shift of market clout to mobile phones was not successful. Stephen Elop, who was a former Microsoft executive and is now the CEO of Nokia, said that Nokia was facing a “burning stage” before the two companies announced their cooperation last week. He believes that Nokia is under pressure from cheap phones and other smartphones produced by Chinese phone makers. Nokia's troubles are not limited to this. Even in the smartphone market, the Symbian platform, which is about to be phased out by Nokia, is in an awkward position, surrounded by iOS and Android. Consumers do not crave Symbian as much as they crave iOS, and Symbian also lacks the open source code of Android. Elop relied on mobile operators, which found that their control over the phones they sold was squeezed by Apple and Android. They want to see the emergence of a third smartphone competitor so that they can bargain over the price and features of the phone with the phone supplier. On paper, Nokia and Microsoft's strategic partnership does make sense. Setting aside other issues, both companies have vast resources and are determined to retaliate. One of the reasons for Nokia's share price drop last Friday was its refusal to reduce its investment in R&D. But the problem is that what looks consistent on a slide cannot be achieved in reality. The reason why large companies find it difficult to cooperate is that they each have their own fields. Nokia will focus more on this cooperation, while Microsoft will sell the WindowPhone system to other mobile phone manufacturers. There are many collaborations in the aviation and automotive industries, as it is difficult to convince the government to make a full acquisition. However, business cooperation is still not the preferred option, as it is difficult to decide which company should control what, and how the two companies should cooperate. As the company president said, Nokia hopes that this cooperation will bring about the expected results. Nokia must hope that the history of the business alliance will not be repeated on them. (Duoji)
大师大势解读：马竞顾杯赛恐失联赛国米主胜作胆1、博洛尼VS那不勒推荐10欧洲平均赔率：2.82-3.06-2.49。依据博洛尼亚的实力，打出最近不错的战绩，说明了球队的状态值得称赞，上轮客场4:3逆转热那亚后，球队已经脱离了降级区，但球队会状态不易保持。那不勒斯上轮即使主场2:2战平罗马，但球队最近的攻击乏力依然很明显，加之防守上始终不令人放心，如本轮能有效解决，客胜不是没有可能。亚盘开出的受让平/半盘，首选1，次选0。2、锡耶纳VS帕尔玛推荐31欧洲平均赔率：2.20-3.11-3.25。锡耶纳此前3轮2胜1平，保级的希望不是没有，从最近几轮主场的表现来看，他们还具备一定的战斗力。反观帕尔玛上轮一球拿下桑普后，结束联赛9轮不胜，即便如此，也不能掩盖后防不稳的毛病。亚盘开出的平/半盘中低水，水位有上升的趋势，映照出本轮平局的可能性很大，首选1，次选3。3、巴里VS切沃推荐31欧洲平均赔率：2.00-3.18-3.71。巴里经历赛季初的凶猛，最近几轮渐渐归于平淡，上轮更是4球负于卡塔尼亚，本轮主场对阵切沃，不容有失。切沃上轮2:1战胜卡利亚里后，球队取得两连胜，状态保持得不错，但受困于整体实力等因素，很难在巴里的主场有所作为。亚盘由初盘的半球高水到即时受注后的平/半盘低水，巴里有望迎来反弹。4、巴勒莫VS利沃诺推荐3欧洲平均赔率：1.50-3.75-6.79。上轮客场掀翻尤文后，巴勒莫目前位居联赛第四，本赛季的主场还未有失手加上边路进攻的体系日益成熟，让远道而来的利沃诺难有取胜的机会。利沃诺后卫莫罗、里瓦斯本轮停赛，后防残缺不全，加之客场作战，亚盘开出的一球盘中水，胜负没有悬念。5、亚特兰VS乌迪内推荐30欧洲平均赔率：2.29-3.10-3.09。老鹰的锋线在3:0大胜拉齐奥后，就陷入了沉寂，加之后防不稳，直接导致最近几轮成绩下滑，本轮面对最为直接的保级对手，不敢掉以轻心。乌鸡本赛季通过防反战术并取得一定的成效，但迪纳塔莱缺阵给本轮客场之旅蒙上了一层阴影。亚盘开出的平/半盘中高水，看好两队分出胜负。6、卡利亚VS卡塔尼推荐31欧洲平均赔率：1.98-3.18-3.81。上轮客场被切沃逆转，卡利亚里经历了两连败，球队排名有些下滑，但主场的卡利亚里此前10轮7胜3平的战绩堪称魔鬼，本轮迎战一向在客场打反击的卡塔尼亚，只要立足于防守，客队取胜的希望渺茫。亚盘开出的半球盘中高水，首选1，次选3。7、国米VS热那亚推荐3欧洲平均赔率：1.40-4.18-7.88。国米上轮3:2有惊无险拿下主场战绩不错的乌鸡后，与排名第二的米兰仅有4分之差，本轮坐拥主场，不会放过任何一个主场拿分的机会来巩固榜首位置。热那亚上轮主场被博洛尼亚逆转后，士气受到一定的影响，加之客场作战、排名稳居中游等因素给本轮作战的战意提出了疑问。亚盘由初盘的一球/球半盘中高水到即时受注后的一球盘低水，降盘降水，国米取胜不是什么问题。8、桑普多VS拉齐奥推荐3欧洲平均赔率：2.07-3.14-3.55。桑普上轮一球小负帕尔玛后，球队结束6轮不败，本轮迎战蓝鹰，桑普迫切需要3分来冲击前四位置，本轮前锋帕奇尼、波济回归球队，将大大增强球队的攻击实力。反观拉齐奥，上轮在行将完场让紫百合将比分扳平，到手的3分变成1分，现在球队已经在为保级而战。此番交手，亚盘开出的平/半盘中低水，认为桑普取胜无疑。9、毕尔巴VS瓦拉多推荐30欧洲平均赔率：1.73-3.46-4.66。毕尔巴鄂竞技的主场向来强悍，此前打出过4连胜的小高潮，这样的主场对苦于保级的瓦拉多利德来说，难以逾越。亚盘开出的半球盘低水，对主队甚是看好，但须防瓦拉多利德的触底反弹。10、马洛卡VS希洪推荐3欧洲平均赔率：1.73-3.44-4.64。马洛卡最近的状态起起伏伏，上轮艰难拿下瓦拉多利德后，勉强跻身联赛第五，本轮坐拥联赛战绩不错的主场(7轮6胜1负)迎战希洪，亚盘开出的半球盘超低水，看好马洛卡的主场优势。希洪上轮3:2拿下奥萨苏纳后，球队取得3轮不败，已经远离降级区，本轮客战，放弃的可能性比较大。11、马拉加VS萨雷斯推荐31欧洲平均赔率：1.61-3.57-5.51。马拉加近8轮联赛仅输给皇马、巴萨。可见球队在对阵弱队时的优势。萨雷斯本赛季降级的趋势明显，本赛季联赛客场无一胜绩的记录相信不会再马拉加身上打破。亚盘开出的半/一盘低水，不看好萨雷斯。12、萨拉戈VS马竞技推荐30欧洲平均赔率：2.54-3.23-2.62。萨拉戈萨重攻轻守，本轮后卫普利多停赛，无疑给本就不稳的后防雪上加霜，目前球队仅高出降级区4分，本轮对阵有欧战分心的马竞，亚盘开出的平手盘中低水，胜利的天平已向主队倾斜。马竞自弗洛雷斯上任后，球队表现出来的斗志与韧性，有目共睹，但联赛上半程欠债太多，联赛无望的他们已经将目标锁定在杯赛上，在成功淘汰加拉塔萨雷后，就更强化了这一目标，同时也给本轮的战意提出了疑问。13、奥萨苏VS赫塔菲推荐31欧洲平均赔率：2.15-3.22-3.26。奥萨苏纳上轮客场败走希洪后，球队已3轮不胜，联赛排名下滑得很厉害，整体状态不是很好。赫塔菲与奥萨苏纳有点难兄难弟的味道，同样联赛排名中游、都已有几轮不胜，此番交手亚盘开出的平/半盘中水，平局的可能性很大，首选1；如果临盘时稳定，次选3。14、西班牙人VS维拉利推荐10欧洲平均赔率：2.38-3.19-2.86。西班牙人凭借着主场最近5轮(4胜1平)的拿分，目前已经脱离降级区。维拉利尔在欧洲联赛出局后，将重心转向了联赛，上轮1球拿下拉科后，球队追求比较实用的打法来争取下赛季的欧战资格，本轮客战必然全力以赴，首选0，次选1。胜负彩第10020期：10-31-31-3-30-31-3-3-30-3-31-30-31-10(1024注)	巴里,莫罗,里瓦斯,迪纳塔莱,帕奇尼,波济,瓦拉多利德,萨雷斯,萨拉戈,普利多,弗洛雷斯	正向	Master trend interpretation: Atletico Madrid may lose the league in the cup match, and Inter Milan's main victory is the main bet. 1. Bologna vs. Napoli, recommend 10. European average odds: 2.82-3.06-2.49. Based on Bologna's strength, the recent good performance indicates that the team's condition is worthy of praise. After reversing Genoa 4:3 at home last round, the team has already escaped from the relegation zone, but the team's condition is not easy to maintain. Napoli, although it drew 2:2 at home against Rome in the last match, the team's recent attack is still weak, and the defense is still not reassuring. If it can be effectively solved in this match, a win is not impossible. The Asian Handicap is set at +0.5. We prefer 1, and 0 is the second choice. 2 Siena vs. Parma, recommend 31, European average odds: 2.20-3.11-3.25. Siena won 2 and drew 1 in their previous 3 matches, and there is still a chance of survival. From the performance of their home games in the last few rounds, they still have some fighting spirit. After Parmal won 1-0 against Sampdoria in the last match, they ended their 9-match league unbeaten, but this still cannot cover up the problem of unstable defense. The lower water level in the half/one goal opening of the Asian handicap indicates an upward trend, reflecting a high possibility of a draw in this round. The first choice is 1, and the second choice is 3. 3. Barry vs. Chievo, recommend 31, European average odds: 2.00-3.18-3.71. Barry experienced the fierce at the beginning of the season, and gradually returned to normal in the last few rounds. In the last round, they lost 4-0 to Catania. In this round, they will play at home against Chievo and can't afford to lose. Chievo won two consecutive matches after defeating Cagliari 2-1 in the previous round, and the team's performance was not bad, but it was difficult to do something in the home of Bari due to factors such as overall strength. The Asian Handicap went from a half ball with high water to a half/one ball with low water after the current bet, and Bari is expected to bounce back. 4. Palermo vs Livorno, recommend 3, European average odds: 1.50-3.75-6.79. After beating Juventus at home last round, Palermo is now in the fourth place in the league. The home field has not been lost this season, and the wing attack system is becoming more and more mature, making it difficult for Livorno to win. Livorno's defenders Mollo and Rivas are suspended, and the defense is incomplete. In addition, they are playing away. The Asian handicap of one goal with medium water has no悬念suspense in the win or loss. 5. Atalanta vs Udinese, recommend 30. European average odds: 2.29-3.10-3.09. The Eagles' front line, after a 3:0 victory over Lazio, fell silent, and the defense was unstable, directly leading to a decline in recent results. In this round, facing the most direct promotion opponent, they cannot afford to be careless. The roosters have achieved certain results this season through counter-attack tactics, but the absence of Dinatale casts a shadow on this round of away games. The upper limit of the level/half ball with high water is expected to see the two teams win or lose. 6, Cagliari vs Catania, recommend 31, European average odds: 1.98-3.18-3.81. After being overturned by Cittadella in the last away game, Cagliari suffered two consecutive defeats, and the team's ranking had slightly declined. However, Cagliari's home team had a record of 7 wins and 3 draws in the previous 10 rounds, which was considered a devil. In this round, facing Catania, which always counterattacks in the away game, as long as the guest team focuses on defense, the hope of winning is very faint. The half ball with high water in the Asian handicap, prefer 1, second 3. 7, Inter VS Genoa recommendation 3 European average odds: 1.40-4.18-7.88. After Inter beat the good home team Crotone 3-2 at home in the previous round, they are only 4 points behind Milan, who are second. At home this round, they will not miss any opportunity to get points at home to consolidate their position at the top. After Genoa was overturned at home in the previous round by Bologna, its morale was somewhat affected, and the factors of away match and stable ranking in the middle of the league raised doubts about its fighting spirit in this round. The Asian Handicap went from a 1/1.5 goal with high water to a 1 goal with low water after the current bet, the reduction in the handicap and the reduction in the water level, and winning for Inter is not a problem. 8 Sampdoria vs Lazio, recommend 3, European average odds: 2.07-3.14-3.55. After Sampdoria lost 1-0 to Parma in the previous round, the team ended its 6-game unbeaten streak, and in this round, they will face the Blue Eagles. Sampdoria urgently needs 3 points to challenge the top four positions. In this round, forward Paolini and Pozzi returned to the team, which will greatly enhance the team's attacking strength. As for Lazio, after the final whistle of the last match, they let Fiorentina equalize and lost the three points they had in hand. Now the team is fighting for survival. In this match, the lower water in the half/one goal handicap of the Asian handicap suggests that Sampdoria will definitely win. 9. Bilbao vs Valadolid, recommend 30. European average odds: 1.73-3.46-4.66. The home of Bilbao Athletic has always been strong, and it has achieved a 4-game winning streak before. Such a home is difficult for Valadolid, which is struggling to stay in the league, to overcome. The half ball opening with low water on the main team is very optimistic, but be careful of Valladolid's rebound. 10. Mallorca vs. Xianghong, recommend 3, European average odds: 1.73-3.44-4.64. Malaga's form has been up and down recently, and after a tough win over Valladolid, they barely made it into the top five of the league. In this round, they will face Xianghong at home, which has a good record in the league (6 wins and 1 loss in 7 rounds). The Asian handicap opened with a half ball and low water, and Malaga's home advantage is favored. After Xianghong won 3-2 against Osasuna in the previous round, the team has been unbeaten in 3 rounds and is far away from the relegation zone. The possibility of giving up in this round is relatively large. 11. Malaga vs. Serez, recommend 31. European average odds: 1.61-3.57-5.51. Malaga lost only to Real Madrid and Barcelona in their last 8 league games. It is clear that the team has an advantage when playing against weaker teams. Sarri's relegation trend this season is obvious, and the record of no away win in this season's league will not be broken by Malaga. The Asian Handicap was set at half/one with low water, and I don't have high hopes for Sarees. 12. Zaragoza vs. Atlético, recommend 30. European average odds: 2.54-3.23-2.62. Saragossa is attacking and neglecting defense, and the defender Pudido is suspended in this round, which undoubtedly adds to the instability of the defense that is already unstable. At present, the team is only 4 points above the relegation zone. In this round, they are playing against Atletico Madrid, who are distracted by European competitions. The Asian handicap has opened a draw with low water, and the balance of victory has already tilted towards the home team. The fighting spirit and resilience of the team after Flores took office can be seen, but the team has too much debt in the first half of the league, and they have already set their sights on the cup competition. After successfully eliminating Galatasaray, this goal was further strengthened, and at the same time, it raised questions about their motivation for this round. 13. Osasuna vs. Hetafe, recommend 31, European average odds: 2.15-3.22-3.26. After Osasuna lost at Xiangyang in the previous round, the team has not won in three consecutive matches, and the league ranking has dropped significantly. The overall performance is not good. Hercules and Osasuna are a bit like difficult brothers, both with mid-table league rankings and several consecutive losses. In this match, the Asian handicap opened with a half/one goal line at medium water, and a draw is very likely. The first choice is 1; if the final line is stable, the second choice is 3. 14. Spain VS Villarreal, recommend 10. European average odds: 2.38-3.19-2.86. The Spaniards have managed to get out of the relegation zone thanks to the 4 wins and 1 draw in the last 5 home games. After Villarreal was eliminated from the Europa League, they shifted their focus to the league. After winning 1-0 against La Coruna last round, the team is pursuing a more practical style of play to secure a place in the Europa League next season. They will certainly give their all in this away game. The first choice is 0, and the second choice is 1. Matchday 10020: 10-31-31-3-30-31-3-3-30-3-31-30-31-10(1024 tickets)
男子捡到警察手机发诈骗短信被抓获晨报讯捡到他人手机后，竟然动起了歪脑筋，企图通过短信诈骗对方亲友7万多元。然而，朱某怎么也没想到，自己捡到的手机竟原本属于嘉定一名刑警。当他将30条诈骗短信发给“电话簿”上的联系人时，大部分短信实际上传给了嘉定公安的民警。昨天，记者从嘉定警方获悉，朱某诈骗一分未得，便被抓获。“我是许林（化名），我现在外地出了点事，请速汇2000元至农行95599×××××（账号），开户人姓名杨武军。”今年春节期间，嘉定公安局刑侦支队民警许林的同事陆续收到一个陌生号码发来的相同短信。“许林当天还在单位加班，怎么一下子到了外地？”同事感觉事有蹊跷，纷纷打电话询问许林，最终证实许林并未发过这则短信。然而，令许林纳闷的是，发短信的人为什么会知道他的真实姓名，并会有那么多同事的联系方式？经过仔细回忆，许林想起去年6月乘坐出租车时，自己曾遗失过一部手机，他马上办理了手机补卡手续，而这次收到短信的30名亲友均为原来手机“电话簿”上的联系人。“这很可能是一起短信诈骗案！”出于职业敏感，许林立即电话通知所有可能收到短信的亲友同事不要上当，同时投入到案件侦查工作中。经调查，许林发现银行开户人杨武军的身份是虚构的。与此同时，民警通过银行监控系统发现，有一名男子每天都要到嘉定塔城路一银行ATM机上查询账户信息。2月6日下午，经过跟踪守候，许林和同事最终在塔城路一家医院门口将这名男子抓获，当场缴获了许林曾经丢失的手机。经审讯，犯罪嫌疑人朱某交代了自己利用许林遗失的手机，企图通过短信诈骗7万多元的犯罪事实。目前，朱某已被刑事拘留。（记者倪冬实习生孔文）	朱某,许林,杨武军,倪冬,孔文	负向	A man was caught after he tried to defraud the owner's relatives of over 70,000 yuan by sending fraudulent text messages after finding a police officer's phone. However, Zhu never expected that the mobile phone he found belonged to a detective from Jiading. When he sent 30 fraudulent text messages to contacts in his address book, most of the messages were actually sent to police officers in Jading Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, the journalists from Jiading police force learned that Zhu Mou did not get any money from the fraud and was arrested. I am Xu Lin (a pseudonym). I have encountered some problems in a place outside my home. Please transfer 2000 yuan to the account of Yang Wujun, account number 95599××××× at the Agricultural Bank as soon as possible. During the Spring Festival this year, colleagues of Xu Lin, a police officer from the Criminal Investigation Brigade of Jiading Public Security Bureau, received the same text message from an unknown number in succession. Xu Lin was still working overtime at the unit that day, how could he suddenly be in another place? The colleagues felt that something was amiss and called Xu Lin to inquire, and it was finally confirmed that Xu Lin had not sent this text message. However, Xu Lin was puzzled as to why the person who sent the text message knew his real name and had so many colleagues' contact information. After careful recollection, Xu Lin recalled that he had lost his mobile phone when he took a taxi last June. He immediately processed a new SIM card for his mobile phone, and the 30 relatives and friends who received the text message this time were all contacts in the original mobile phone's address book. This is most likely a case of SMS fraud! Due to his professional sensitivity, Xu Lin immediately called all his relatives, friends, and colleagues who might receive the text message to warn them not to be deceived, and then he threw himself into the investigation of the case. After investigation, Xu Lin found that Yang Wujun, the account holder of the bank, was a fictitious identity. Meanwhile, the police discovered through the bank's surveillance system that a man would check his account information at an ATM on Taiguo Road in Jiading District every day. On the afternoon of February 6, Xu Lin and his colleagues finally caught the man at the gate of a hospital on Taicheng Road after tracking and waiting. Xu Lin's lost mobile phone was seized on the spot. After interrogation, suspect Zhu Mou confessed to the criminal fact of attempting to defraud over 70,000 yuan by using Xu Lin's lost mobile phone via text message. Currently, Zhu Mou has been detained in criminal custody. (Ni Dong, reporter, Kong Wen, intern)

It was Zhou Xin, a household registration officer of Dunchen Police Station. Zhou Xinfeng, who apprehended the criminal barehanded, covered his chest with his hand after being stabbed by the criminal and chased the criminal for 44 meters, and died on the ground. Hero resume Zhou Xin, born on January 6, 1979, joined the public security work in August 1999, joined the party in 2002, has a bachelor's degree, and is a first-level police inspector. ■Victim: A young man stabbed four people in a row on the street at 8:00 p.m. on the 20th. Guan Lingsong, the owner of the lottery ticket station at No. 46 People West Road, Fuling District, was closing the door and going home. A young man jumped down from the stairs and pressed his shoulder. He felt pricked in his left thigh, but before he could react, the man had already fled. Then he took off his pants and found a 1.5 cm long cut on his left leg. Call the police quickly! This brat has already assassinated two people. The masses shouted to Kuang. The clinic on People West Road No.16, which treated three victims, said that the first victim, Mr. Wen, was about 40 years old, and was stabbed on the side of Fuling District People's Hospital Second Outpatient Department; the second victim, Mr. Zeng, was stabbed in front of a tobacco store on People West Road; the injured parts of Wen and Zeng were both thighs, and the wounds were all 1.5 cm long and about 1.5 cm deep. Journalists learned that the three victims were stabbed within less than five minutes. After debridement and bandaging, the three people are out of danger. The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported yesterday that the criminal had stabbed another pedestrian in the street before. ■ Eyewitness: The injured police officer chased the criminal for 44 meters. Ms. Zhong, an eyewitness, said that after the criminal stabbed Kuang Lingsong, he swung the knife and ran towards the South Gate Mountain direction along People West Road, and the crowd shouted, ""He killed someone, catch him."" When the criminal ran to the Dunning Police Station, a thin young man in plain clothes shouted, ""Stop!"" I am a policeman! Go to grab the criminal barehanded. The robber struggled and stabbed the thin young man with the knife in a frenzy. After the struggle lasted for more than ten seconds, the thin young man covered his chest and abdomen, chased the criminal closely, and shouted, ""Catch him."" Ms. Zhong said that after chasing the thin young man for 44 meters, he fell to the ground and never stood up again. Uniformed police officers arrived, helped up the thin young man, and shouted, ""Call an ambulance quickly, he is Zhou Xin, a police officer from our Dunren Police Station."" It was then that Zhong realized that the thin man was Zhou Xin, the household registration officer of the Dunningren police station. At around 8 p.m. that night, Zhou Xin, who had been working overtime, left the police station to eat something and encountered the crowd shouting to catch the criminal. The police and the public sent Zhou Xin to the hospital for treatment. Due to serious injuries and excessive bleeding, Zhou Xin died after unsuccessful rescue. The doctors from the涪陵区急救中心 who participated in the rescue said that if Zhou Xin had not continued to pursue after being injured, perhaps the blood loss would not have been so much, and the chances of rescue would have been greater. ■ Manhunt: 40 minutes later, the suspect was captured after the police in Fuling quickly mobilized forces to set up a net for control. At 8:40 p.m. that night, the police arrested the suspect Shao Aojie at his home in Songcui Road, the dormitory of the Petroleum Company. Police searched Shao Aojie’s home and found a knife, which was initially confirmed to be the murder weapon used to kill the police officer and others through surveillance footage comparison. It was found that Shao Aojie is 18 years old, unemployed, and a drug user. He was caught by the police twice before, and the motive for this crime is still under further investigation. The news of Zhou Xin’s sacrifice while apprehending a criminal spread quickly throughout Fuling City. From 9 a.m. yesterday morning to around 7 p.m. last night, thousands of citizens spontaneously went to the Fuling District Funeral Home to pay their respects. Heroic Deeds to be Commemorated for First-Class Merit, and Martyr and First-Class Hero: Yesterday morning, at the request of Wang Lizhun, the Party Secretary of the Public Security Bureau, the leaders of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Huagang, Yang Zengyu, and Wang Tingyan, rushed to Fuling District to visit and comfort the relatives of Zhou Xin. At around 3 p.m. yesterday, Wang Lijun took a helicopter to Fuling to visit and comfort the relatives of Zhou Xin. Wang Lijun clearly instructed on the follow-up work: ""We cannot let heroes bleed and cry."" At 4 p.m. yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported to the media that Zhou Xin was awarded a First-Class Merit. The Fuling District Government said that it was actively preparing materials to apply for Zhou Xin as a revolutionary martyr. The municipal public security bureau also said that it would apply to the Ministry of Public Security for the first-class model of the police force for Zhou Xin. It was learned that the unit had previously insured Zhou Xin with Ping An Insurance Company for work-related injury accidents. Last morning, the general manager of the Chongqing Fuling branch of the insurance company, Zhong Jian, said that the 200,000 yuan work injury accidental injury insurance amount will be transferred to Zhou Xin's beneficiary account the day after tomorrow. Suspect's grandmother: dropped out of junior high and roamed society, stabbed others multiple times in the past. Yesterday morning, the reporter found Shao Aojie's grandmother, Zhang Grandma. She said that she did not know that her grandson was taking drugs. After Shao Aojie's parents divorced, they neglected to take care of him. Shao started to hang out in society since he was in Grade 8. The day before yesterday, Shao Aojie came to find her from his accommodation on Songcui Road. When she left, she sent Shao downstairs and watched him get into the car. Mrs. Zhang explained that she did so because Shao Aojie had delusions. Whenever he saw someone on the street talking on the phone or shouting for a long time, he would think that they were cursing him, and he would go to hurt them. Shao Aojie's violent tendencies began last year. Zhang's grandma said that he had stabbed several people with a small knife, including a resident of the surname Deng last year, and the compensation was still unpaid. As Shao Aojie's parents could not be reached, his grandparents also moved out of their original residence. As of last night at 6 p.m., the reporter had not found any other relatives of Shao Aojie. In memory of heroic parents: ""I am proud of you and I am proud of you,"" in the sound of funeral music, in front of the coffin, Zhou Xin's father held back tears to greet guests. He said that his son, having chosen to be a people’s police officer, should always be ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. Zhou Dad works at the Qingxi Town Police Station, and his mother runs a clinic in Jiaoshi, so they have been living apart for a long time. Zhou Xin did not receive good care when he was young. Now that she is about to retire, her son has left… Zhou Mom also chose to be strong in the face of her son's departure. She said, ""Son, I won't cry. I am proud of you and I am proud of you, I can't cry."" But Mrs. Zhou still cried, and her eyes were swollen. Colleague Feng Wenbo said that Zhou Xin's colleague, Wu Grandma, is a lonely elderly person who is over 90 years old and it is very difficult to communicate with her. However, Zhou Xin visits Wu Grandma's home every week to chat with her. When Wu Grandma meets people, she praises ""Zhou Huxing"". Feng Wenbo said that Zhou Xin seldom spoke in the office, but was very talkative when receiving the public's inquiries or assistance, and was even tireless. Now, recalling, he was living up to the words he had once said, ""Do not let the police uniform down."" ""My beloved wife is still waiting for you to have dinner,"" said Jian Zhengmin, the hero's wife, who was already unable to speak clearly. She cried to the reporter about the process of meeting, falling in love with, and experiencing life with her husband. She said that in August last year, their love child, a daughter, was born, and the family began a sweet life of three. How can I explain to the little one? Didn't you say you were going to teach her to sing ""Daddy's Good""? Qian Zhengmin sobbed again. Zhou Xin left home at around 7 o'clock that morning, saying that there were many things to do at the police station that day. That evening, at around 7:00, he still called Jian Zhengmin to say that the materials had not been organized yet, and he would come back to have dinner later, asking her not to wait. She also said, ""It's the weekend, so you can wait a little longer!"" Come back early. To my surprise, it was a call from the nurse. Jian Zhengmin ran to the hospital, and his beloved was already with her eyes closed. “I am still waiting for you to have dinner…” Jian Zhengmin burst into tears again. This version of the manuscript was written by reporter Xia Xiangzou."

Chen Mengxiong described the gold mine, which is 1,600 square kilometers in size and owned by the Australian mining tycoon OZMinerals, as having only explored 30 square kilometers, but already discovered a large amount of gold deposits.

山寨网站骗术多双节出行如何防骗打假随着双节的临近，机票的预订日趋火爆，特价机票销售更是一票难求。随着人们对互联网的运用越来越多，利用特价机票来吸引顾客眼球的虚假网站也越来越多。由于互联网进入门槛较低，模仿成本也很低，导致目前机票预订市场上山寨横行，甚至一些虚假网站直接利用特价机票进行诈骗行为。中国消费者协会依据中文在线旅行网站“去哪儿网”(Qunar.com)今年6-8月全网(调查对象包含所有参与过在线旅行预订的消费者，调查方式包含：网络调查问卷、电话访问、拦访等)2400多个预订消费者样本量分析，80%的投诉针对于黑代理、无资质代理、山寨网站、钓鱼网站、假冒网站。如此强大的网站易容术眼下，随着在线旅游知名网站的崛起，许多网站都深受山寨网站等这类的虚假网站的困扰，例如去哪儿网(Qunar.com)、南方航空官方网站(csair.com)以及携程网(ctrip.com)。这些山寨网站为骗取消费者信任，其模仿手段之高明，令人惊叹。此类网站由于缺乏对代理商的资质认证能力，常使消费者利益受到损害。不过，山寨毕竟是山寨，消费者只要仔细观察，细心留意，还是能够看出其中的明显差别。假400电话害人不浅400电话作为一种企业为消费者提供的便捷服务，一直受到广大消费者的欢迎。但是，目前骗子利用手段，在百度一类的通用搜索网站频繁打出广告，广告中提供一个400电话。当消费者拨通该电话时，骗子往往以各种理由让消费者向某个人银行卡中进行汇款。之后，该400电话变成无法接通状态，消费者往往在投诉时才发现上当。去哪儿网机票服务无400电话据记者了解到，全球最大的中文在线旅行网站去哪儿网(Qunar.com)的机票服务是没有400电话的，专线是：01058752660。去哪儿网机票产品部高级总监杨威表示，设定投诉专线能够方便用户识别，防止上当。所以，提供400电话的机票搜索的“去哪儿网”都是冒牌货。此外，杨威提醒消费者在拨打百度搜索到的相关旅游网站400电话时，应该进行反向查询，将400电话放回百度搜索，如出现同一号码提供多家知名旅游网站服务时，则可判定该号码为诈骗电话。山寨如此强大，如何才能辨别真假呢？杨威提示广大消费者可以从以下几个方法去辨别真假网站：第一：看ICP备案，每个正规的网站下方都会有ICP备案的信息，证明其网站的经营合法性。第二：合法的代理商都会有CATA(民航运输协会)的认证资质，与去哪儿网合作的代理商，全部都得通过CATA认证，用户在其他网站上消费的时候，也要仔细辨认是否有CATA认证。第三、正规的代理商都会采用第三方在线支付平台或银行进行交易，比如去哪儿网站会要求代理商必须有这个能力才给予合作，如果有让用户通过汇款的方式交易的，都是骗子网站。所以防止上当受骗最直接的办法就是拒绝直接汇款。“金牌机票服务系统”帮助消费者找到优质代理商值得一提的是，去哪儿网站最近推出的“金牌机票服务系统”可以帮助消费者去伪存真，找到优质放心的代理商。据了解，该系统提供了四个系统平台，从资质、服务、投诉处理、用户监督四个方面提供机票保障服务。包括：1、去哪儿网验证代理人资质的100%的CATA认证代理商体系；2、规范机票代理商管理的代理商投诉管理系统；3、查询去哪儿网搜索的所有机票代理商的详细信息的代理商信息查询系统4、以及将用户评价因素加入搜索排序结果中，以促进代理商改进自身服务的消费者评价排序体系，选择有正规资质的服务商，掌握山寨们的诈骗手段：不直接汇款，不在没有安全保障的支付平台提供账户密码等，双节出行预订机票才能更有保障。	杨威	正向	"Counterfeit websites are full of tricks, how to prevent fraud and fake goods during the Double Festival. As the Double Festival approaches, the booking of air tickets is becoming increasingly popular, and the sale of special air tickets is in great demand. As people use the Internet more and more, the number of fake websites that use discounted airfares to attract customers' attention is also increasing. Due to the low entry barrier of the Internet and the low imitation cost, fake websites are rampant in the current air ticket booking market, and some false websites even directly use special air tickets for fraud. Based on the analysis of more than 2,400 samples of online travel bookings from the Chinese Consumer Association, which conducted a nationwide survey (the survey subjects included all consumers who had participated in online travel bookings, and the survey methods included online questionnaire surveys, telephone interviews, intercept interviews, etc.) from June to August this year, 80% of the complaints were directed at black agents, unqualified agents, fake websites, phishing websites, and fake websites. With such powerful website spoofing techniques, many websites are now plagued by fake websites such as Qunar.com, the official website of China Southern Airlines (CSAIR.com), and Ctrip.com, as online travel websites gain prominence. These fake websites are so skillful in deceiving consumers that they are truly amazing. Such websites often harm consumers' interests due to their lack of ability to authenticate the qualifications of agents. Nevertheless, knockoffs are still knockoffs, and consumers can still spot the obvious differences if they observe and pay attention carefully. False 400 calls are not harmless. As a convenient service provided by enterprises for consumers, 400 calls have always been popular among a wide range of consumers. But, at present, scammers are using means to frequently post ads on general search websites such as Baidu, providing a 400 phone number in the ads. When consumers call this number, the fraudster often asks the consumer to transfer money to someone's bank card for various reasons. Then, the 400 hotline becomes unreachable, and consumers often realize they have been cheated when they complain. Qunar.com's air ticket service has no 400 hotline. According to the reporter's understanding, the dedicated line of Qunar.com's air ticket service is: 01058752660. Yang Wei, the senior director of Qunar's Air Ticket Product Department, said that setting up a complaint hotline would make it easier for users to identify and prevent them from being cheated. So, the ""Qunar"" that provides 400 phone number ticket search is a fake. In addition, Yang Wei reminds consumers to conduct a reverse query when calling the 400 phone number of the related travel websites found by Baidu search, and return the 400 phone number to Baidu search. If the same number provides services for multiple well-known travel websites, it can be determined that the number is a scam call. Counterfeits are so powerful. How can we distinguish the real from the fake? Yang Wei reminded the general consumers to identify the true and false websites from the following methods: First, check the ICP filing, each legitimate website will have ICP filing information below, which proves the legitimacy of its website operation. Second, legitimate agents will have CATA (Civil Aviation Transport Association) certification qualifications. All agents cooperating with Qunar.com must pass the CATA certification. When users consume on other websites, they should also carefully identify whether there is a CATA certification. Third, regular agents will use third-party online payment platforms or banks for transactions. For example, Qunar website requires agents to have this capability in order to cooperate. If there are websites that require users to trade through remittance, they are fake websites. So the most direct way to prevent being cheated is to refuse to transfer money directly. The ""Gold Medal Air Ticket Service System"" helps consumers find high-quality agents. Notably, the ""Gold Medal Air Ticket Service System"" launched by Qunar website recently can help consumers distinguish the truth from falsehood, and find high-quality and reassuring agents. It is understood that the system provides four system platforms, providing air ticket guarantee services from four aspects: qualifications, services, complaint handling, and user supervision. Including: 1. 100% CATA certified agents system for validating agent qualifications on Qunar; 2. Agent complaint management system for standardizing agent management; 3. Agent information query system for querying detailed information of all agents on Qunar; 4. Consumer evaluation ranking system that incorporates user evaluation factors into search ranking results to promote agents to improve their own services. Choose service providers with legitimate qualifications, master the fraud tactics of fake agents: do not transfer money directly, do not provide account passwords on payment platforms without security guarantees, and booking air tickets during the Double Festival can be more secure."

烧钱时代的团购仍缺行业标准随着拉手网、大众点评网的相继融资，团购市场已进入烧钱时代。不过，服务质量的落后以及行业标准的缺失，在未来一段时间内，团购网站仍将在摸爬滚打中前行。据国内知名互联网研究机构CNZZ日前发布的数据显示，今年一季度，全国电子商务行业网站数达到2.17万家，同比增长31.16%。其中，团购网站的增长是电子商务行业网站整体增长的主要构成部分。不过，快速的增长势头并不能掩盖市场存在的不足。自2010年3月至今，我国团购网站数量已超过4000家，并且正以每日接近10家的速度在增长。在团购网站发展只有短短一年多的时间里，因为具有建设门槛低、能直接带来现金流、更依赖线下资源等特点，使得一大批中小型网站迅速进入或转型到团购领域。多领域的进入，并没有让团购网站得到较好发展，反而出现了欺诈、质量不达标和服务不到位的问题，让团购网站行业的前景扑朔迷离。对此，嘀嗒团副总裁朱敏告诉记者，目前，中国的团购网站尚处于起步阶段，就像正在学习走路的孩子一般，成长的过程中难免会有磕绊，需要在其间对问题不断地发现以及改善，并形成强有力的服务流程保障体系，以使团购网站未来的道路走得更加顺利。据了解，嘀嗒团联手一茶一坐餐厅推出第二期无限畅吃团购服务，除了一茶一坐“原价品质、预约透明、菜品齐全”的保障，嘀嗒团更是祭出了“全国门店品质服务承诺，嘀嗒团全程提供退款服务”的承诺，将三大服务全面升级。此次嘀嗒团与一茶一坐推出的三大措施在全面提升团购服务体验中，包括了一茶一坐服务升级，其全体门店全力准备迎高峰客流；同时，嘀嗒团服务投诉热线全程待命，“400”热线将在使用期内全程直通一茶一坐客服，统筹全国服务；此外，嘀嗒团全程支持退款，在团购完成后，消费者对网评不满意，嘀嗒团随时提供退款通道为消费者全额退还此次团购的费用。此前，第一期嘀嗒团一茶一坐的团购，虽然受到了消费者的热捧，但是由于各方面准备不足，出现了预约困难、门店准备不足、服务质量问题、网络投诉反馈不及时等缺陷。针对此状况，嘀嗒团积极收集消费者的体验信息，内部进行了多次讨论，并且与一茶一坐进行了深入沟通，再次与一茶一坐联手推出“无限量任你吃”的团购套餐，不仅菜单升级，而且大力提升了服务水平。商报记者李铎	朱敏,李铎	正向	"Group buying still lacks industry standards in the era of burning money. With the financing of Lashou.com and Dianping.com, the group buying market has entered the era of burning money. However, the lag in service quality and the absence of industry standards will continue to force group buying websites to struggle for some time. According to the data released by the well-known domestic internet research institution CNZZ recently, the number of e-commerce industry websites in the country reached 21,700 in the first quarter of this year, up 31.16% year-on-year. Among them, the growth of group buying websites is the main component of the overall growth of e-commerce industry websites. But, the rapid growth momentum does not mask the market’s shortcomings. Since March 2010, the number of group buying websites in China has exceeded 4,000 and is growing at a rate of nearly 10 per day. Within just over a year of the development of group buying websites, due to the low construction threshold, the ability to directly bring in cash flow, and greater reliance on offline resources, a large number of small and medium-sized websites have quickly entered or transformed into the group buying field. Entering multiple fields has not helped group buying websites develop well, but instead has led to problems such as fraud, substandard quality, and poor service, making the prospects of the group buying website industry uncertain. Zhu Min, vice president of Dida Team, told the reporter that currently, China's group buying websites are still in the early stage, just like a child learning to walk. During the process of growth, there will inevitably be bumps, and problems need to be continuously discovered and improved, and a strong service process guarantee system needs to be formed to make the future road of group buying websites smoother. It is understood that DiDaTuan has teamed up with YiChaYiZuo Restaurant to launch the second phase of unlimited all-you-can-eat group buying service. In addition to the ""original quality, transparent reservation, and complete menu"" of YiChaYiZuo, DiDaTuan has also made a commitment to ""commitment to quality service of all stores nationwide, and full refund service provided by DiDaTuan throughout the process"", which will comprehensively upgrade the three services. The three measures launched by Dida Team and Yichazuo in this campaign have comprehensively improved the group buying service experience, including service upgrades at all Yichazuo stores, which are fully prepared to meet the peak traffic; at the same time, the Dida Team service complaint hotline is on standby throughout, and the ""400"" hotline will be directly connected to Yichazuo customer service throughout the usage period, coordinating services nationwide; in addition, Dida Team fully supports refunds, and after the group buying is completed, if consumers are dissatisfied with the online reviews, Dida Team will provide a refund channel at any time to fully refund the cost of this group buying. Previously, the first Tida Group Buy for Tea and Seating received a warm welcome from consumers, but due to inadequate preparation in various aspects, it encountered problems such as difficulty in making reservations, insufficient preparation at the store, quality service issues, and untimely feedback on online complaints. In response to this situation, Dida Team actively collected consumer experience information, held multiple internal discussions, and had in-depth communication with Yichatizuo. They have teamed up with Yichatizuo again to launch a ""no limit, eat as much as you want"" group-buying package, not only upgrading the menu, but also significantly improving service quality.

中国为08年全球经济增长贡献22%09年贡献更大联合国日前在京发布的《2009年世界经济形势与展望》分析指出，中国仍然是东亚以及全球经济的增长动力，但与欧美的贸易衰减将会使以中国为首的大部分亚洲经济体发展减缓，因此中国需要新的经济战略来维持增长。报告指出，中国为2008年全球经济增长贡献了大约22%，而且在2009年很可能贡献更大，因为大多数发达国家经济都陷入了衰退。不过，中国的增长速度也在放缓，国内生产总值增长从2007年的11.9%下降到2008年的9.1%，但仍算比较高，而预计2009年会降到8%。报告预测熏如果不是因为国内最终需求的持续强劲发展熏下降可能更大。在过去几年全球高速发展的情况下熏中国经济发展在很大程度上受到美国庞大的消费者需求的推动熏而后者又是由信贷条件放宽的刺激和急速上升的房价支撑。中国、日本等国日益增加的贸易盈余积累了大量的外汇储备熏并且愿意购买美元资产熏从而为美国在此阶段的增长提供了资金。然而，这种全球发展模式并不能持续长久。中国和其他发展中国家的出口增长如今已直接和间接地受到美国经济衰退的影响。联合国报告指出熏中国拥有1.9万亿美元外汇储备和平衡的政府预算熏有充足的政策空间可以采用更多必要的扩展型财务政策来刺激国内需求熏从而弥补疲软的出口下滑。中国已开始利用这一政策空间制定大规模的财政刺激计划熏这一举措很可能会恢复全球需求。中国已宣布在2009年和2010年期间实施5860亿美元(或中国国内生产总值的15%)的财政刺激方案。刺激方案旨在加强内需熏重点放在基本设施投资和消费两方面。目标包括低收入住宅、农村基础设施、水、电、运输、环境、技术创新和几个灾区的重建，尤其是5月12日的地震区。该方案还通过各种措施来提高贫困人群的收入，包括更高的补助金和2009年政府对粮食的更高收购价。		正向	China contributed 22% to global economic growth in 2008 and even more in 2009. The United Nations' 2009 World Economic Situation and Prospects, which was recently released in Beijing, pointed out that China remains the driving force for economic growth in East Asia and the global economy. However, the decline in trade with Europe and America will slow down the development of most Asian economies led by China. Therefore, China needs a new economic strategy to maintain growth. The report notes that China contributed about 22% to global growth in 2008, and may have contributed even more in 2009, as most developed economies fell into recession. But China’s growth rate has also slowed, with GDP growth falling from 11.9% in 2007 to 9.1% in 2008, but still relatively high, and expected to fall to 8% in 2009. The report projects that, if not for the sustained strong growth in domestic end-use demand, the decline could have been even greater. In the past few years, as the global economy has grown rapidly, China’s economy has been driven to a large extent by the huge demand from US consumers, which was in turn supported by easy credit conditions and rapidly rising house prices. China and other countries with growing trade surpluses have accumulated large foreign exchange reserves and are willing to purchase dollar assets, thereby providing funding for US growth in this phase. However, this global model of development cannot last. Export growth in China and other developing countries is now directly and indirectly affected by the US economic recession. The UN report notes that China has $1.9 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and a balanced government budget, with sufficient policy space to adopt more necessary expansionary financial policies to stimulate domestic demand, thereby offsetting the decline in weak exports. China has begun to exploit this policy space to launch large-scale fiscal stimulus, a move that is likely to revive global demand. China announced a fiscal stimulus package of 5860 billion US dollars (or 15% of GDP) for the period of 2009 and 2010. The stimulus package aims to strengthen domestic demand, focusing on investment in basic facilities and consumption. The targets include low-income housing, rural infrastructure, water, electricity, transportation, the environment, technological innovation, and the reconstruction of several disaster areas, especially those affected by the earthquake on May 12. The scheme also raises the incomes of the poor through a variety of measures, including higher subsidies and the higher government procurement prices for food in 2009.
海通证券：关注中高仓位成长风格基金□海通证券(微博)单开佳倪韵婷近期，不少正面的因素提升了投资者的热情：政策实质性微调引发了投资者很多的憧憬；通胀下行以及房产价格的回落有助于政策有改善的空间；流动性目前相对略显宽松；海外不确定性因素暂时有所缓解。但是，未来市场仍需要一个“经济触底”的现实数据，或者看见一个“新周期的启动”，方可作为右侧启动的信号，因此A股市场可能更多的是震荡反弹走势。目前经济依然处于下滑过程中，可能会导致上市公司盈利能力的下滑，投资者可以更多地关注有产业政策扶持的相关行业，这些行业可能具有攻守兼备的特征，同时一些超跌低估的板块可能也会有反弹的机会，这些机会可能更多的集中在成长板块、部分消费板块。在这样的市场环境中，投资者可以继续买入股票混合型基金，选股能力突出的、仓位中高的主动型基金可能会有一定的超额收益。当然，投资者也可以利用股票型分级基金高风险份额参与反弹。在基金的大类配置上，股票混合型开放式基金建议风格略偏成长，在市场的反弹过程中政策驱动以及估值修复可能具有较好的投资机会。政策驱动包括文化产业、环保、水利、农业补贴、战略新兴产业等；估值修复包含了前期一些超跌板块；业绩稳定性可以关注部分消费类个股。分析这些板块，更多的可能集中在一些偏成长风格的股票中，因此，建议投资者在做基金组合时可以在均衡配置的基础上略偏成长。从交易型基金来看，依据历年走势，通常11月开始是封闭式基金分红行情预演的时点，对应传统封基的折价将会有显著收窄。但今年以来由于市场整体震荡走低，可分配利润少了，多数基金单位可分配利润都在0.1元以下，显著低于历年。不过我们认为四季度市场可能处于一个震荡的过程中，在市场反复的过程中，如果踏准节奏，基金可分配收益或会有一定幅度的增加，加之当前折价回归收益处于今年以来的高位，建议投资者关注选股能力较优、波段把握能力较优且三季度末可分配利润相对较高的基金，这类基金的分红潜力可能更大。对于分级基金而言，在市场震荡反复的格局下，股票型高风险份额可能将有较多波段性的机会，但由于右侧经济和盈利的拐点未现，市场的反弹仍需谨慎，因而高风险份额的收益需要及时兑现。对于债券分级基金高风险份额可能仍有正收益，但是行情相比前期那波反弹或较弱。目前市场上所有低风险份额的折价有显著的回归，折价率虽然可能仍有收窄空间，但空间或小于前期，但随着到期折算期限的临近，即将折算的低风险份额折价进一步扩大的动力不大，投资者可继续持有。从指数基金以及ETF而言，市场左侧大底部明朗，因而长线仍可布局，同时来回震荡行情中投资者可采用交投简便的ETF博取波段。11月债券市场略偏利好，在历经了较长时间债券熊市之后，债券基金的配置价值重新回归。而随着央行公开市场操作，短期市场资金面可能略微宽松，因而我们认为货币基金下月的收益或略有下降。不过对于现金流动性要求较高的投资者而言，货币基金仍是目前最有效的现金管理工具。在构建基金组合上，我们对积极型、稳健型以及保守型三类不同风险承受能力的投资者给予资产配置比例的建议。我们给予这三类投资者在权益类基金(包含股票、混合型基金以及交易型基金)一个配置比例区间，分别为积极型配置区间60-100%；稳健型30-80%，保守型10-40%，均衡配置比例分别为80%、55%和25%。当我们判断市场上涨概率较大时，我们会在权益类基金上配置较高的比例，反之则降低比例。本期建议积极型投资者可以配置75%的主动型股票混合型基金，15%的交易型基金(含指数型基金)，10%的偏债型基金；稳健型投资者可以配置55%的主动型股票混合型基金、10%的交易型基金(含指数型基金)、20%的偏债型基金、15%的货币市场基金；保守型投资者可以配置35%的主动型股票混合型基金、20%的偏债型基金、45%的货币市场基金。	单开佳,倪韵婷	正向	"HTSC: Pay Attention to Growth Style Funds with Medium to High Stock Positions□HTSC (Weibo) Shan Kai Jia Ni Yunti In recent weeks, many positive factors have boosted investors' enthusiasm: policy substantive fine-tuning has sparked many investors' expectations; the decline in inflation and the decline in property prices have helped to improve policy space; liquidity is currently relatively slightly loose; overseas uncertainties have temporarily eased. But, the future market still needs a realistic data of ""economic bottoming out"" or a ""new cycle launch"" as a signal for the right-side launch, so the A-share market may be more of a fluctuating rebound. The economy is still in a downward phase, which may lead to a decline in the profitability of listed companies. Investors can pay more attention to industries that are supported by industrial policies, which may have the characteristics of both attack and defense. At the same time, some sectors that are undervalued and have fallen sharply may also have the opportunity for a rebound. These opportunities may be more concentrated in growth sectors and some consumption sectors. In such a market environment, investors can continue to buy stock hybrid funds, and actively managed funds with outstanding stock selection capabilities and higher positions may have some excess returns. Of course, investors can also participate in the rebound with the high-risk shares of stock-type leveraged funds. In terms of the general allocation of the fund, it is recommended that the style of equity mixed open-end funds be slightly biased towards growth. During the market rebound, policy-driven and valuation restoration may provide good investment opportunities. Policy-driven sectors include culture, environmental protection, water conservancy, agricultural subsidies, strategic emerging industries, etc.; valuation recovery includes some over-corrected sectors in the early stage; and the stability of earnings can be paid attention to in some consumption stocks. Analyze these sectors, more may be concentrated in some growth style stocks, so it is suggested that investors can slightly tilt towards growth when constructing a fund portfolio. From the perspective of trading-type funds, based on the historical performance, it is usually the time point for the preview of the closed-end fund dividend situation in November, corresponding to the significant narrowing of the discount of traditional closed-end funds. But since the beginning of this year, due to the overall market fluctuations and decline, the distributable profits have decreased, and the distributable profits of most fund units are below 0.1 yuan, which is significantly lower than in previous years. But we believe that the market in the fourth quarter may be in a process of oscillation. During the process of market fluctuations, if the rhythm is stepped on, the distributable income of the fund may increase to a certain extent. In addition, the current discount return income is at a high level since the beginning of the year. It is recommended that investors pay attention to funds with better stock selection ability, better ability to grasp the rhythm, and relatively higher distributable profits at the end of the third quarter. The potential for dividends of such funds may be greater. For分级 funds, in the pattern of market fluctuations, stock-type high-risk shares may have more wave-like opportunities, but since the turning point of the right-side economy and profits has not yet appeared, the market's rebound still needs to be cautious, so the returns of high-risk shares need to be realized in a timely manner.

Although the discount rate may still narrow, the space for narrowing may be smaller than before. As the maturity conversion period approaches, the incentive for the discount of low-risk share classes that are about to be converted to further expand is not large, and investors can continue to hold. For index funds and ETFs, the left side of the large bottom of the market is clear, so long-term layout can still be made, and investors can use ETFs to make short-term profits in the back-and-forth oscillation. Bond markets were slightly positive in November, as the bond bear market that had lasted for a long time saw the return of the allocation value of bond funds. With the central bank's open market operations, the short-term market liquidity may be slightly relaxed, so we think the returns of money market funds next month may slightly decline. But for investors with a higher demand for cash liquidity, money market funds remain the most effective tool for cash management at present. We provide asset allocation recommendations for investors with different risk tolerance, including aggressive, moderate, and conservative types, when constructing a fund portfolio. We give these three types of investors a range of allocation ratios for equity funds (including stocks, hybrid funds, and ETFs), which are 60-100% for aggressive allocation, 30-80% for stable allocation, and 10-40% for conservative allocation, with balanced allocation ratios of 80%, 55%, and 25%, respectively. When we judge that the probability of the market rising is relatively large, we will allocate a higher proportion to equity funds, and reduce the proportion otherwise. For this period, active investors are advised to allocate 75% of their assets to active stock and mixed funds, 15% to ETFs (including index funds), and 10% to bond-oriented funds. Conservative investors can allocate 55% of their assets to active stock and mixed funds, 10% to ETFs (including index funds), 20% to bond-oriented funds, and 15% to money market funds. Conservative investors can allocate 35% of their assets to active stock and mixed funds, 20% to bond-oriented funds, and 45% to money market funds."
关小刀火线解盘：拉齐奥值得力捧桑坦德持续低迷新浪体育讯　1、巡游者VS维拉推荐：31维拉前边的比赛平局过多，因此虽然迄今不败，但成绩却不太理想；巡游者迄今已有两场胜利，可惜主场不但没有积分，甚至连进球都没有取得过，这个多少令QPR的球迷多少有些失望。由于两队联赛的轨迹久未交集，近年只在联赛杯中有过两次交锋，各有一场胜利。平均赔率2.303.203.01实际上是暗挺巡游者，主流公司的赔率调整中，多家公司的主胜赔率在周中之后均有明显下调。在客队保持不败的情况下，巡游者能够让出平半高水，还是可以看高一线。2、科隆VS霍芬海姆推荐：30本季科隆的表现总是出人意料，仅有的两次胜利均来自客场，而且还都是打入对手4球的大胜，但主场却一胜难求，3场联赛进球也只有两粒，看起来防守反击才是科隆安身立命的看家法宝；近两场打入7球的霍芬海姆同样进球如麻，而且主客场的表现更加均衡。两队在德甲中共有6次交锋，霍芬海姆在前三次连胜之后，最近三次遇到科隆均没有占到便宜。由于科隆的表现欠缺稳定，所以平均赔率2.843.312.31仍然是看好客场作战的霍芬海姆，两队近期力火都比较猛，本场打出大比分的可能性较大。3、不来梅VS赫塔推荐：31柏林赫塔的上一个客场把卫冕冠军多特拉下马，不过挑战不来梅却没有往绩优势，近4次做客都输掉了比赛。本季不来梅的开局相当不错，似乎在完成球员的新陈代谢之后，沙夫教练将率领不来梅步又一个黄金时期，目前不来梅的成绩、状态和数据都相当出色，因此主场迎战赫塔亦可看高。只是目前的平均赔率1.813.484.04给得有些蛊惑，即使赫塔前3个客场1胜2平保持不败，但毕竟是一支刚刚回到德甲的升班马，而且在夏季转会中并没有大肆买人提升实力，因此排名第2的不来梅仅仅让出半球低水，盘赔均不太合理，本场冷门不得不防。4、锡耶纳VS莱切推荐：32002年以来在甲乙两级和杯赛的交锋中，锡耶纳对莱切1胜6平4负处于完全下风。新季开打之后，两队的成绩都不出意料排名下游，上个客场莱切战胜博洛尼亚表现得较为出色，但主场输给亚特兰大显示这支球队的表现还不足以信任。平均赔率1.953.163.84却是对迄今不胜的锡耶纳更为看好，周中联赛结束之后，多数主流公司放均明显降低了主胜赔率，多家公司均将主胜从2.05以上降到2.00以下，亚洲初盘半球中水，锡耶纳值得一博。5、亚特兰大VS诺瓦拉推荐：31两支升班马均表现不错，亚特兰大3轮拿7分排名前列，诺瓦拉则上轮力克国米拿到意甲首胜——当然，战胜国米有对手将帅不和的因素，诺瓦拉的胜利也直接导致加斯佩里尼最终下课。两队上季在意乙有过两次交锋，亚特兰大1平1负处于下风。两队虽然目前的积分是亚特兰大领先，但实际上由于夏季转会中都没有引入能够明显提升球队的球星，因此两队实力应当还是在同一档次，亚特兰大的成绩有很大偶然性，平均赔率1.783.264.55对亚特兰大更为看好，亚洲初盘多开到半一超高水，主队也并非稳操胜券。6、卡利亚里VS乌迪内推荐：31三轮过后，两队分别有6分和7分入账，表现相当出色。2000年以来两队在意甲共交锋16次，乌迪内9胜3平4负占据明显的上风，其中近5次相遇从未被卡利亚里击败过。平均赔率2.463.112.78与上季乌迪内前来挑战相比，客胜赔率有比较明显的提升，这也说明在经历过夏季转会的运筹之后，乌迪内的实力还是有所下降到的，主流公司中BWIN和Centrebet等在周中之后有压低主胜的调整趋势，本场可以谨慎看好主队不败。7、卡塔尼亚VS尤文推荐：10对博洛尼亚的比赛中武西尼奇功过各半，尤文也因此结束了连胜势头，不过对于上赛季连欧战资格都没捞到的尤文来说，现在的开局表现的确能够明显提升球队的自信。《都灵体育报》预测尤文的阵容将会做出一些调整，埃里亚取代停赛的武西尼奇，马特里作为单箭头，尤文可能会摆出一个4141的阵形，这应当也是为下轮迎战AC米兰(微博)作战术准备。平均赔率3.833.161.96很正路地看好尤文客让半球中水，双选尤文客场不败比较稳妥。8、帕尔马VS罗马推荐：30关于罗马的焦点在于，如果罗马继续不胜，恩里克会不会步加斯佩里尼的后尘？除了因伤缺阵的斯特克伦博格，罗马其他主力均能出场，恩里克如何选择阵容因此也更加引人注目。两队的交锋中罗马占据绝对优势，2001年以来在联赛和杯赛中对帕尔马15胜3平2负，其中客场也是连续6次交锋保持不败。帕尔马是目前意甲失球最多的球队之一，面对罗马的前锋防线告破的可能性较大，不过随着乔温科的复出，帕尔马坐镇主场也有进球机会。由于恩里克指挥罗马在本赛季的正式比赛中还未胜过，平均赔率2.883.082.39因此对客队的信心也不是很强，本场两队打出大比分的可能性较大，看好两队分胜负。9、拉齐奥VS巴勒莫推荐：3一度以请辞来激将的雷贾终于率领拉齐奥获得赛季首胜，预计本场将延续上轮的首发阵容；巴勒莫在力克卡利亚里之后取得主场两连胜，不过第一个客场输给亚特兰大的表现还是相对弱了一些。两队历史交锋中势均力敌，各胜6场之外只有3场平局。尽管积分上巴勒莫尚处领先地位，但平均赔率1.813.314.27还是认为夏天走了多名核心之后，巴勒莫还将遇到更多的考验，亚洲初盘半球低水，可以考虑拉齐奥主胜做胆。10、莱万特VS西班牙人推荐：31两队交锋中莱万特1胜3平4负处于明显下风，不过本季莱万特的表现令人刮目相看，上周末爆冷战胜皇马(微博)之后，莱万特士气上扬，再接再厉客场又拿下瓦列卡诺，目前竟然排名前列；西班牙人仍然保持着主场出色的特点，目前的6分全部来自主场，客场却先后输给马洛卡和萨拉戈萨，遭到两连败。平均赔率2.073.223.43正路看好成绩出人意料的莱万特，主流公司的主胜赔率多数是从2.30以上下调到2.00－2.05之间，亚洲初盘给到平半低水，可以小敲主队不败。11、格兰纳达VS奥萨苏纳推荐：10格兰纳达上一个主场战胜维拉利尔取得首胜，从实力上来看，这支1976年降级之后首次重返西甲的球队无疑是本季降级的大热门，而且阵中缺少拥有丰富西甲经验的球员，这对于格兰纳达的保级相当不利；从比赛过程和数据上来看，格兰纳达战胜维拉利尔有很大的偶然性，其他3场联赛一球未进还是很说明问题的。平均赔率2.223.173.13略为倾向主场作战的格兰纳达，不过从主流公司的赔率体系来看，本场客胜的几率似乎更高一些。12、希洪VS桑坦德推荐：32001年以来两队在甲乙两级交锋中，希洪1胜2平5负处于完全下风，唯一的胜利是上季西甲倒数第2轮，希洪在战胜桑坦德之后才算是彻底保级成功。本季两队的开局都不好，希洪4连败积分垫底，桑坦德也是迄今不胜，排名倒数第4。平均赔率2.053.223.49仍然是略为倾向主场作战的希洪，主流公司的主胜基本分布在2.00－2.05区间，亚洲初盘给主队半球高水，本场上盘值得一博。13、萨拉戈萨VS马拉加推荐：30马拉加取得三连胜，3场比赛的得失球为6:0，智利工程师执教的功夫逐渐显露出来，除了佩莱格里尼之外，还有谁能在短期之内将众多新人捏合成为一支防守如此出色的球队！萨拉戈萨的主帅阿吉雷(JavierAguirre)亦是业内名帅，曾执教奥萨苏纳、马竞以及墨西哥国家队。平均赔率3.193.302.14及其调整还是看好客场作战的马拉加，不过近两场比赛萨拉戈萨的进攻打得很猛，马拉加并无必胜把握。14、雷恩VS圣埃蒂安推荐：3两队近期交锋中，雷恩在法甲和杯赛中5胜2平优势明显。本赛季的开局阶段，雷恩也表现得十分出色，目前是排名积分榜的第2位，而且是法甲进球最多的球队。值得注意的是，雷恩迄今的17粒入球是由9名球员打入的，这说明雷恩的进攻并未完全依赖进攻核心蒙塔诺(VictorMontano，哥伦比亚前锋)，球队的进攻点多，得分手法多样，令对手不太好防。圣埃蒂安开局两连胜之后突然陷入低迷，近5轮法甲只拿到2分，过多的伤病显然对球队的影响较大。平均赔率1.783.284.47与往季比较变化不大，主场作战的雷恩胜望颇浓。临场推荐和任九实战请关注关小刀(微博)的博客(关小刀)	关小刀,桑坦德,沙夫,加斯佩里尼,武西尼奇,马特里,恩里克,斯特克伦博格,乔温科,雷贾,莱万特,瓦列卡诺,萨拉戈萨,佩莱格里尼,阿吉雷,雷恩,圣埃蒂安,蒙塔诺,VictorMontano	正向	Shut Xiaodao fire line analysis: Lazio is worth supporting, and Santander continues to low in new sina sports. 1, Rangers vs Villa recommendation: 31 Villa has too many draws in the previous matches, so although undefeated so far, the results are not ideal; Rangers has already won two matches so far, but unfortunately, not only has no points at home, but also has not scored a goal, which is a little disappointing to the QPR fans. Due to the long lack of intersection in the league trajectory of the two teams, they have only met twice in the League Cup in recent years, with each team winning one game. The average odds of 2.303.203.01 are actually favoring the Wanderers, and in the odds adjustments of mainstream companies, the home win odds of many companies have been significantly reduced after the midweek. With the away team unbeaten, it is still advisable to back the visitors at high water on half ball. 2. Cologne vs. Hoffenheim recommendation: 30. This season, Cologne's performance has always been unpredictable, with only two victories coming from away games, both of which were by a score of 4-0 or more, but they have not won a single home game, with only two goals scored in three league matches. It seems that counter-attacking is Cologne's mainstay; in the last two games, Hoffenheim, which scored 7 goals, was also prolific, and its home and away performances were more balanced. The two teams have met six times in the Bundesliga, and after winning the first three consecutive matches, Hoffenheim has not been able to take advantage of the last three matches against Cologne. Due to Cologne's performance is not stable, the average odds of 2.843.312.31 still favor the away team Hoffenheim, both teams' recent offensive power is relatively strong, and the possibility of a large score in this match is relatively large. 3.不来梅 vs Hertha BSC recommendation: 31 Hertha BSC lost the last match as the guest, which knocked the defending champion Dortmund down. However, there is no advantage in terms of past performance when challenging不来梅. They lost in the last 4 visits. This season,不来梅 started off quite well, and it seems that after completing the metabolism of the players, Coach Sha will lead不来梅 into another golden period. At present,不来梅's performance, condition, and data are all very good, so it can be seen high when they play at home against Hertha. Just the current average odds of 1.81 3.48 4.04 are somewhat misleading. Even though Hertha has maintained an unbeaten record in its first three away games, it is still a newly promoted team in the Bundesliga, and it did not significantly strengthen its team in the summer transfer window. Therefore, the second-placed不来梅only offered a half-ball low water, which is not very reasonable in terms of the odds and the spread. We must guard against a cold draw. 4. Siena vs. Lecce recommendation: Since 2002, in Serie A, Serie B and cup matches, Siena is 1-6-4 against Lecce, completely in the shadow. After the new season, the two teams ranked at the bottom of the league, and Lecce's performance in the last away match against Bologna was relatively outstanding, but the defeat at home against Atalanta showed that the performance of this team was not worthy of trust. The average odds of 1.95, 3.16, and 3.84 are more favorable for Siena, which has not won so far. After the league ended on Wednesday, most major companies significantly reduced the odds of a home win, with many companies lowering the odds of a home win from above 2.05 to below 2.00. The Asian initial handicap was half a ball with medium water, and Siena is worth a try. 5. Atlanta vs Novara Recommendation: 31 Both promotion teams have performed well, Atlanta has 7 points in 3 rounds and ranks in the front, while Novara beat Inter in the last round to win their first victory in Serie A - of course, Novara's victory was also due to the discord among the Inter staff, and Novara's victory directly led to Gasperini's final dismissal. Last season, the two teams met twice in the Lega Pro, and Atalanta was at a disadvantage with one win and one loss. Although the current points of the two teams are leading by Atalanta, in fact, since neither of the two teams introduced any stars that could significantly improve the team during the summer transfer, the two teams' strength should still be in the same level, and Atalanta's performance is very much accidental. The average odds of 1.783.264.55 are more optimistic about Atalanta, and the Asian initial disk is opened to half a point with high water, and the home team is not necessarily in control. 6. Cagliari vs Udinese recommendation: 31 After three rounds, both teams have scored 6 and 7 points respectively, and their performance is quite outstanding. Since 2000, the two teams have met 16 times in Serie A, with Udinese winning 9, drawing 3 and losing 4, clearly in the upper hand, and never losing to Cagliari in the last 5 meetings. The average odds of 2.463.112.78 are higher than those of the previous season when Udinese came to challenge, which also indicates that after the summer transfer, the strength of Udinese has declined. Among the main companies, BWIN and Centrebet have a trend of lowering the home win odds after the midweek, so it is advisable to cautiously support the home team not to lose in this match. 7. Catania VS Juventus recommendation: Witschenich's performance was half good and half bad in the 10 games against Bologna, and Juventus thus ended its winning momentum. However, for Juventus, which failed to win any European qualification last season, the current performance can indeed significantly boost the team's confidence. The Turin Sports predicts that Juventus will make some adjustments to its line-up, with Eriksen replacing the suspended Vucini, and Matri as the lone striker. Juventus may line up in a 4-1-4-1 formation, which should also be a tactical preparation for the next round of AC Milan. The average odds of 3.833.161.96 are quite reasonable to look forward to Juventus to give half a ball with medium water, and it is more stable to double select Juventus to be unbeatable at home. 8, Parma vs. Rome recommendation: 30 About Rome, the focus is whether Enrique will follow Gasperini's footsteps if Rome continues to be undefeated? Besides Stekelenburg, who is out injured, all of Roma’s main players are available, and Enrique’s choice of team will therefore be even more interesting. In the confrontation between the two teams, Rome has an absolute advantage, with 15 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses in the league and cup since 2001, and has not lost in 6 consecutive away matches. Palermo is one of the teams with the most goals conceded in the current Serie A, and it is likely that the Palermo defense will be breached by the Roma forwards. However, with the return of Giovenco, Palermo also has the opportunity to score at home. Since Enrique commanded Rome to win in the official matches of this season, the average odds of 2.883.082.39 indicate that the confidence in the away team is not strong, and the possibility of a large score in this match is relatively large, and it is advisable to look forward to the two teams to win or lose. 9. Lazio vs. Palermo recommendation: 3 Once again, Reja, who resigned to provoke, finally led Lazio to win the first game of the season, and it is expected that the starting lineup of the previous round will continue in this game; Palermo won two consecutive home games after defeating Cagliari, but the performance of the first away game against Atalanta was still relatively weak. In the historical matches between the two teams, they are evenly matched, with each team winning 6 games and only 3 draws. Although Palermo is still leading in the points, the average odds of 1.813.314.27 still believe that after many core players left in the summer, Palermo will still face more challenges. The Asian initial handicap is half a ball with low water, and it is worth considering Lazio's main win as the胆. 10. Levante vs. Real Sporting, recommendation: 31, in the two teams' confrontation, Levante is 1 win, 3 draws and 4 losses, which is clearly in a disadvantageous position. However, Levante's performance this season is worth looking at. After defeating Real Madrid (Weibo) last weekend, Levante's morale has risen, and they won again in Vallecano away, and are now in the top ranks. Real Sporting still maintains the excellent characteristics of the home field. The current 6 points are all from home, and they have lost to Mallorca and Zaragoza in the away games, suffering two consecutive defeats. The average odds are 2.073.223.43. The main road is looking forward to the results of Levante, which are unexpected. The main company's home win odds have been adjusted from above 2.30 to 2.00-2.05. The Asian initial disk gives half a point with low water, and it is possible to slightly knock on the home team's unbeatable. 11. Granada vs Osasuna recommendation: 10 Granada won their first home game of the season against Villarreal, and from the strength of the team, this team, which returned to La Liga for the first time since 1976, is undoubtedly a big favorite to drop this season. Moreover, the team lacks players with rich La Liga experience, which is very unfavorable for Granada's survival. From the process and data of the game, Granada's victory over Villarreal was very accidental, and the fact that they did not score in the other three league games still indicates a problem. The average odds of 2.223.173.13 slightly favor Granada, but from the perspective of the main company's odds system, the probability of a win for the away team seems to be a little higher. 12. Huesca VS Santander Recommendation: 32001 since the two teams have met in the first and second levels, Huesca has 1 win, 2 draws and 5 losses, and is completely in the shadow. The only victory is the last second round of last season, and Huesca only succeeded in completely staying in the league after defeating Santander. Both teams had a poor start to the season, Xianghong lost four consecutive matches and ranked at the bottom, and Santander is also undefeated so far and ranks 4th from the bottom. The average odds of 2.053.223.49 still slightly favor the home side, Xihong, with the main company's home win basically distributed in the range of 2.00-2.05. The Asian initial disk gave the home team half a ball with high water. It is worth a try on the upper disk in this match. 13. Zaragoza vs Malaga recommendation: 30 Malaga has won three consecutive matches, with a total of 6 goals scored and 0 goals conceded in the three matches. The skills of the Chilean engineer are gradually coming out. Apart from Pellegrini, who else can combine a large number of new players into a team with such a good defense in a short period of time! Javier Aguirre, the coach of Zaragoza, is also a famous coach in the industry, who once coached Osasuna, Atletico and the Mexican national team. The average odds of 3.193.302.14 and their adjustments still favor Malaga playing away, but in the last two matches, Zaragoza's attack has been very fierce, and Malaga has no certainty of winning. 14. Rennes vs Saint-Etienne, recommendation: 3 In recent matches between the two teams, Rennes has a clear advantage with 5 wins and 2 draws in Ligue 1 and the cup. During the early stage of this season, Rennes also performed very well, currently ranking second in the league table and the top goal scorer in Ligue 1. Notably, Rennes' 17 goals so far have been scored by 9 players, indicating that Rennes' attack is not entirely dependent on the attacking core Victor Montano (Colombian forward), and the team's offensive points are diverse, and the scoring methods are varied, making it difficult for the opponent to guard. Saint-Étienne, after winning the first two matches of the season, suddenly fell into a slump, only getting 2 points in the last 5 Ligue 1 matches, and the excessive injuries clearly had a greater impact on the team. The average odds of 1.78, 3.28, and 4.47 are not much different from those of previous seasons, and the home team Rennes has a strong chance of winning.

Cummings said that he was not afraid of being used by women in real life. When I was a child, I was very concerned about being deceived by others and about their feelings not being genuine towards me. Now that I am 40, not a child anymore, I hope to communicate with everyone outside without any pretense, and not to set any boundaries. One does not want to think that one is being used, and thus cannot make friends. Which type do you prefer for the two actresses who play supporting roles with Su Qi and Zhang Jingchu? Andy Lau did not answer directly: ""Now, people won't just look at appearance, but will pay more attention to the other person's thoughts."" """

赶集网多名高管因公关风波离职日前，赶集网多名高管突然集体离职，舆论掀起对赶集网被愚弄的猜测：由姚晨代言的赶集网花了2亿元做广告，但因为广告中的驴子太过“招摇”，被赶驴网钻了空子。有网友甚至大呼，赶集网上了敌人当了！与此同时，赶集网的关注度和搜索量急剧上升。赶集网真的上当了吗？凭一篇公关稿蹿红的赶驴网真能把赶集网“公关”下去?赶驴网凭公关稿蹿红“赶集啦！我有一只小毛驴，我从来也不骑。”这句广告词对于经常出行的人来说恐怕不会陌生。从2月初开始，由姚晨代言的15秒钟赶集网广告片同时在中央电视台、地铁和公交移动电视等媒体上循环播放，开展“地毯式”的营销轰炸。令人没想到的是，赶集网的竞争对手百姓网注册了一个“山寨”的赶驴网，借了一把赶集网的风。赶驴网不仅做了一个类似于赶集网的网站标识，还提出类似于赶集网“赶集网，啥都有”的口号——“赶驴网，啥没有？”，“山寨”度相当惊人。此外，诸如《2亿广告费炒红赶驴网》等文章一夜之间在网上广为传播，内容大多称百姓网成功地四两拨千斤，仅花费200元注册了赶驴网的域名“ganlvwang”，就坐享赶集网数亿元广告效果，流量大幅攀升。在业内人士看来，这不过是一场华丽的炒作。赶集网的广告在2月初开始播出，网民对赶驴网的搜索量一直不多。直至当月19日网上出现关于赶驴网的文章时，搜索量才有了较大的提升。赶集网用公关反击舆论似乎并不同情被“山寨”的赶集网。相反，网上出现“赶集网就知道砸钱”和“广告创意存在缺陷”等质疑声。对此，赶集网迅速发起公关反击。名人的议论无疑对本次“驴子事件”起到了扩大效应。创新工场李开复在微博上出了一道题：“考考大家：赶集网首页下方有个‘赶驴网’的友情链接，但点开后才发现是链接到赶集网，又回到原页。为什么？”其实，这不过是赶集网为了防止赶驴网分走流量而作的反击。此外，赶集网还迅速购买了“赶驴”的关键字搜索。3月15日，广告创意人叶茂中在微博中表示：“因为赶集网广告片‘小毛驴篇’大获成功，赶集网投资人今日资本总裁徐新今天送我一台最新款‘苹果’庆贺。”业内人士称，这一做法有明显的危机公关痕迹。赶集网CEO杨浩涌说：“‘赶驴网’占整个搜索流量的千分之一不到。作为企业，更应该关注产品的用户体验和公司长期发展战略，而不是一些小技巧。小技巧带来了几百个用户，但伤害了品牌。说得再过一些，即使抢注了开心网的域名，那又能怎样？过了几年，有谁还记得这个赶驴网？”高管离职原因存疑最近两天，随着赶驴网的关注度下降，赶集网的关注度趋稳。正当外界认为此事将告一段落时，赶集网主管市场与公关的副总裁邓漫、主管SEO（SEO指利用搜索引擎的搜索规则来提高网站在搜索引擎内的排名）的副总裁吕英建以及SEO总监郭彦景离职。杨浩涌向记者证实了这一消息。杨浩涌并未透露这些高管的离职原因。他否认是因为“驴子事件”炒了这些人鱿鱼。他表示：“离职是在广告投放前的1月份。广告效果很好，我们会继续加大投放。”然而，郭彦景的微博显示，郭在2月的最后一天才离职。对此，一位网友疾呼：“赶驴广告即便弄巧成拙，也很容易反拙为巧，何错之有？自毁长城，上敌人的当了！”业内人士指出，因为一个广告就导致公司高管引咎辞职，这不免有些荒唐。就专业角度而言，赶集网的广告没有致命伤，其立体轰炸+经典歌谣+名人代言的效果显而易见。一场华丽的炒作从赶驴网的冒出，到赶集网的反击，再到赶集网高管的离职，赶集网关注度也保持了直线上升，刚注册的赶驴网也获得了相当的关注度。这场争斗中，究竟谁赢了？谁被公关了？首先，赶驴网利用网络公关稿制造舆论，购买关键词，高调“山寨”，迅速招致媒体和网民的关注。其后，赶集网的广告受到舆论质疑，赶集网、投资人和广告人纷纷加入危机公关。待事件即将平息时，赶集网高管离职，将舆论推向另一个小高潮。“如果没有赶驴网的‘毛驴’横插一腿，赶集网的百度关注指数将保持高位，直至3月初。然后随着广告影响力的下降，关注指数下降。”一位业内人士分析说，“赶驴网的‘山寨’让更多的人知道赶集网，将其品牌进行了二次放大。”在这次事件中，赶驴网的公关偷袭和赶集网的反攻都没有出现殊死搏斗的场景。就赶驴网而言，“这算是一次不错的公关炒作。”网络公关专家赵勇评论说，“赶集网的广告投放后，立刻引起了百姓网的关注。百姓网没有足够的资金展开正面竞争，便想出了赶驴网的策略，并在网上发布软文进行公关。”据记者了解，许多网民确实是看了网上的公关稿后才知道赶驴网，并不是从赶集网的广告直接联想到“赶驴”二字。(孙雨)	姚晨,李开复,叶茂中,徐新,杨浩涌,邓漫,吕英建,郭彦景,赵勇,孙雨	正向	"Several senior executives of Ganji.com resigned recently, and the public opinion triggered the speculation that Ganji.com was fooled: Ganji.com spent 200 million yuan on advertising, but because the donkey in the advertisement was too ""showy"", it was exploited by Ganjinong. Some netizens even shouted that the enemy has been on Ganji.com! Meanwhile, the attention and search volume of Ganji.com rose sharply. Did 51job really fall for it? Will the Donkey Network, which rose to fame through a public relations article, really be able to ""public relations"" the Ganji Network? Ganji Network rose to fame through a public relations article: Ganji, come on! I have a little donkey, I never ride it. This slogan is probably not unfamiliar to people who travel frequently. Starting from early February, the 15-second Ganji.com advertisement, endorsed by Yao Chen, was broadcast on media such as CCTV, subways, and bus mobile TV, launching a “carpet bombing” marketing campaign. What no one expected was that Banyu, a competitor of Ganji, registered a ""cloned"" Ganlidu website, riding on Ganji's coattails. In addition to creating a website logo similar to Ganji.com, Ganlou.com also proposed a slogan similar to Ganji.com’s “Ganji.com, everything is here” – “Ganlou.com, nothing is missing?” ”, the degree of ""clones"" is quite shocking. Moreover, articles such as “200 Yuan Advertising Fee Makes Ganlvwang Famous” spread online overnight, with most of the content claiming that Baidu successfully leveraged its weight to achieve a thousand times the effect with just 200 yuan, registering the domain name “ganlvwang” for Ganjiwang, and reaping the benefits of Ganjiwang’s tens of billions of advertising effects, with a significant increase in traffic. To insiders, it is merely a dazzling hype. The job hunting website’s advertisement started airing at the beginning of February, and the search volume for the website was not high. Only after the article about Dala Network appeared online on the 19th of that month did the search volume increase significantly. Ganji.com seems to be less sympathetic to Ganji.com that was “cloned” than to use PR to counter the public opinion. On the contrary, there were doubts such as “Ganji.com just knows how to spend money” and “advertising creativity is defective.” In response, Zhaopin.com quickly launched a public relations counterattack. The gossip of celebrities undoubtedly amplified the effect of this ""donkey incident"". Li Kefu, the founder of Innovation Works, posted a question on Weibo: ""Test everyone: On the bottom of the Zhaopin homepage, there is a link to 'Zhaodelu' as a friend link, but when you click on it, you will find that it is actually a link to Zhaopin, and you will return to the original page."" Why? In fact, this was just a counterattack by Ganji.com to prevent Ganlu.com from diverting traffic. In addition, Ganji.com quickly purchased the keyword search “ganlu”. On March 15, Ye Maozhong, an advertising creative, said on Weibo: ""Because the short film 'Little Donkey' of Ganji.com advertisement was a great success, Ganji.com investor Sun Xin, the president of today capital, sent me a new 'Apple' to celebrate today."" It is clear that this is a public relations move to deal with a crisis. Yang Haoyong, CEO of Ganji.com, said that “Ganlou.com” accounted for less than one-thousandth of the total search traffic. As a business, you should focus more on the user experience of the product and the company's long-term development strategy, rather than some small tricks. A small trick brought in hundreds of users, but damaged the brand. Say a little more, even if it registers the domain name of Happy Net, what then? Years later, who still remembers the Donkey Network? The reason for the departure of senior executives is questionable. In the past two days, as Ganlu Network's attention has declined, Ganji Network's attention has stabilized. Just as the outside world thought that the matter would come to an end, Deng Man, vice president in charge of market and public relations at Ganji.com, and Liu Yingjian, vice president in charge of SEO (SEO refers to the use of search engine search rules to improve the ranking of a website in search engines), and SEO director Guo Yanjing resigned. Yang Haoyong confirmed the news to the press. Yang Haowei did not disclose the reasons for the departure of these executives. He denied it was because he had fired these people on the ""donkey incident"". He said, ""I left in January, before the ad campaign."" The ad campaign is very effective, and we will continue to increase the investment. However, Guo Yanjing's Weibo shows that Guo resigned on the last day of February. One netizen cried out: ""Even if the donkey ad is a case of skillful blunder, it can easily turn the blunder into a clever move, what's wrong with that?"" Self-Destruction Great Wall, fell for the enemy's trick! It is absurd that a company executive should resign in disgrace because of an advertisement. From a professional perspective, Ganji.com's ads have no fatal flaws, and the effects of their multi-dimensional bombardment + classic songs + celebrity endorsements are obvious. A splendid hype emerged from the emergence of Ganlu Network, the counterattack of Ganji Network, and the departure of senior executives of Ganji Network. The attention of Ganji Network has been on a straight upward trend, and Ganlu Network, which was just registered, also gained a considerable amount of attention. Who won in this fight? Who was PR'd? First, Ganlu Network used online public relations to create public opinion, purchased keywords, and made a high-profile ""imitation"" that quickly attracted the attention of the media and netizens. Following that, Ganji.com's ads were questioned by the public, and Ganji.com, its investors, and ad people all joined in the crisis PR. When the event was about to calm down, the senior executives of Ganji.com left their posts, pushing public opinion to another small climax. Without the interference of Mulei from Ganji.com, the Baidu attention index of Ganji.com would have remained at a high level until early March. Then, as the influence of the ads declined, so did the index of attention. An insider analyzed that Gan驴网's ""cloning"" made more people know Ganji网, and amplified its brand for the second time. In this incident, there was no fierce battle between Ganlu Network's PR offensive and Ganji Network's counterattack. For Donkey Network, this is a pretty good public relations stunt. Zha Yong, a network public relations expert, commented that after Ganji.com launched its advertisement, Baixing.com immediately paid attention to it. Since Zhuban.com did not have enough funds to compete head-on, it came up with the strategy of Ganlue.com and launched soft articles online for public relations. As far as the reporters learned, many netizens did not know about Ganzilu.com until they read the public relations articles on the Internet, and did not directly associate the word ""Ganzilu"" with the advertisement of Ganji.com.

下跌市股东增持逾3亿股94%获利《投资者报》分析员杨秀红股指节节败退，股东增持潮纷至沓来。自4月16日股指期货推出，A股市场就一直在震荡下跌中。上证综指4月及5月跌幅约分别达到8%和10%。市场大跌两市哀鸿遍野之际，上市公司股东逆市增持的消息却不断传来，很多忍不住减仓的投资者开始犹豫。据《投资者报》数据研究部的统计，4月以来，上市公司股东已增持逾3亿股，其中5月增持市值超越减持市值，一举实现净增值。2008年10月浮现以来，时隔19个月，这一现象再度重现。观察本轮增持潮背后的“推手”，上市公司的高管表现得热情很高，多家公司出现10余位高管集体增持的场面。不过各家高管的增持数量则是“雷声大雨点小”，大部分高管增持数量均在10万股以下。真正进行大规模增持的，则是“公司”类股东，其增持数量占到本轮增持总量的九成以上。在激进增持后，上市公司股东多有斩获，增持股票在4月及5月的大跌市中大面积逆市上扬、为其带来不菲的账面浮盈。5月增持量创19个月新高据《投资者报》数据研究部统计，今年以来，以月度为单位，在1月累计公告增持数量超过1亿股后，2、3月份迅速萎缩到不足873万股和212万股。伴随着4月以来市场的急速下挫，上市公司股东月度增持规模出现了大规模回升。其中，4月公告增持数量达到2199万股，环比增长逾9倍。此后，在股市继续下探寻底的5月，更是涌现出少有的增持潮，其月度增持数量一举攀升到3亿股左右，环比飙升逾12倍，这是继2009年9月之后，增持数量再度接近3亿股大关。历史上月增持数量超过3亿股的月份也仅有10余个。与此同时，上市公司股东公告增持市值也随之出现大幅波动：1月增持市值创出小新高，接近16亿元，而2月、3月增持市值则下滑到2.8亿元和0.3亿元。随着4月、5月增持潮的涌现，股东公告增持市值也分别回升至3.5亿元和32亿元。截至6月15日，4月以来上市公司股东已经合计增持约3.2亿股，增持市值超过35亿元。在5月汹涌的增持潮和减持规模退潮的背后，催生了罕见的净增持现象。据我部统计，5月股东累计公告增持市值接近32亿元，一举超越同期约19亿元的公告减持规模。Wind资讯统计显示，以月度为单位，A股市场上次出现股东净增持的时间为2008年10月份，当月上市公司股东合计公告增持市值为11亿元，公告减持市值为10亿元。这意味着，时隔19个月后，A股市场股东再现净增持现象。且今年5月股东净增持规模比2008年10月股市见底之时的势头更猛烈。据我们此前的统计，上市公司股东增持潮一般在市场筑底阶段出现，如2005年10月、2008年9月等。此次，大股东再次推动新一轮增持潮，无疑给处于“熊途”的投资者一线希望。长江电力再成增持主要目标观察本轮增持潮背后的主要“幕后推手”，无外乎三大主力，即公司、高管和个人。按增持股东类型(公司、高管、个人)划分，4月以来发布的78次增持公告中，有71次增持出自高管和公司之手，占总数的91%。其中，高管公告增持次数达到46次，居首位。有多家公司涌现了众多高管一齐增持的局面。如南通科技、长航油运、柳化股份等，其背后增持的高管多达10余位。其中，长航油运增持公告显示，5月13日、14日，包括该公司董事长刘锡汉、副董事长朱宁、总经理李万锦等在内的13位高管对自家股票进行了回购，其合计购入股票数量约57万股，成交价格在5.37元至5.5元之间。柳化股份增持公告也显示，5月13日、14日，公司董事长廖能成、副董事长、总经理覃永强、董事苏东升等10位高管共计购入约67万股。每位上市公司高管增持数量，大部分都在10万股以下，多数只购入两三万股；5月增持最多的高管——宗申动力的董事长左宗申增持100万股，增持市值仅为1015万元，且所有高管的增持数量仅390万股，占4月以来总增持量的1.2%，增持势头明显是“雷声大雨点小”。相对于高管的增持，一些“公司”类股东显得较为激进。4月以来累计以“公司”身份增持的股东有16家，合计增持数量达到3.1亿股，合计增持市值达到34.6亿元，占总数的98%。据Wind数据统计，4月公告增持的公司有两家，分别为冀东水泥和中兴商业，5月公告增持的公司则迅速攀升到22家，增持数量最多前两家为长江电力和国电电力。前者的大股东长江三峡集团合计公告增持超1亿股，增持市值逾14亿元；后者的大股东中国国电集团公司合计买入8153万股，公告增持市值达5.43亿元。作为增持主力军，长江电力并非第一次担当月度增持冠军的角色。在今年1月的增持中，长江电力控股股东长江三峡集团就在当月增持了1亿多股，成为当月增持的领军人物。历史上的增持潮中，该集团曾多次出手，大规模回购自家股票。如2009年8月的超千万股增持，2006年7月的近2亿股的增持等。本轮增持潮股东94%获利我部统计了始于今年4月的这场增持潮中股东们的“账单”，结果显示多数股东获得了不错的回报。在4月以来的78次增持公告中，我们剔除了实际发生在今年二季度以前的增持行为。其中，国电电力、海信电器和柳化股份等三家公司，因为在股东增持之后实施了分红送配方案，我们根据其送转方案另行计算了其账面盈亏情况。对于其余上市公司，我们均按照股东平均增持成本及最新股价(6月11日收盘价，下同)的差价测算。最终测算结果显示，94%的增持为其股东带来正收益。在今年5月进行增持且在5月发布增持公告的公司中，海信电器股东青岛海信电子公司的盈利幅度最大，达到26%。此外，宗申动力、上海金陵、南通科技等也为其增持股东带来了超10%的正收益。	杨秀红,刘锡汉,朱宁,李万锦,廖能成,覃永强,苏东升,左宗申	正向	"Shareholders have increased their holdings by more than 300 million shares, with a profit of more than 94%. Analyst Yang Xiuhong of Investor's Daily reports that the stock market is declining, while the tide of shareholders increasing their holdings is coming. Since the stock index futures were launched on April 16, the A-share market has been in a state of fluctuating decline. The Shanghai Composite Index fell by about 8% in April and 10% in May. The market plunged, and in the face of widespread losses in both markets, news of listed company shareholders increasing their holdings against the trend kept coming. Many investors who couldn't resist reducing their positions began to hesitate. According to the data research department of the Investor's Daily, since April, listed companies' shareholders have increased their holdings by more than 300 million shares. Among them, the value of shares purchased in May exceeded the value of shares sold, achieving net value appreciation. Since the emergence of this phenomenon in October 2008, it has reappeared after 19 months. To observe the ""pushers"" behind this round of share acquisitions, the executives of listed companies are very enthusiastic, with many companies seeing more than ten executives collectively increasing their holdings. But the number of shares purchased by the executives of each company was ""much ado about nothing"", with most executives purchasing less than 100,000 shares. The bulk of the purchases, more than 90% of the total, were made by institutional shareholders. After aggressive buying, listed company shareholders have made a lot of money, and the purchased stocks have risen against the market plunge in April and May, bringing substantial paper profits to them. In May, the monthly increase reached a new high of 19 months, according to the data research department of Investor's Daily. In terms of monthly data, after the cumulative number of shares announced in January exceeded 100 million shares, the number of shares in February and March shrank sharply to less than 8.73 million and 2.12 million shares, respectively. Accompanied by the sharp decline of the market since April, the scale of monthly share acquisitions by listed company shareholders has seen a large-scale rebound. Among them, the number of shares purchased in April increased to 21.99 million shares, up more than 9 times month-over-month. Subsequently, in May, when the stock market continued to search for its bottom, there was a rare wave of net purchases, with the monthly net purchase volume jumping to around 300 million shares, up over 12 times from the previous month. This was the second time that the net purchase volume approached 300 million shares after September 2009. There are only about ten months in history where the monthly increase exceeded 300 million shares. At the same time, the large fluctuations in the market value of shares held by listed company shareholders also appeared: the market value of shares held in January reached a new high, close to 1.6 billion yuan, while the market value of shares held in February and March dropped to 280 million yuan and 30 million yuan, respectively. With the emergence of the buying spree in April and May, the market value of the shareholding announcements also recovered to 350 million yuan and 3.2 billion yuan, respectively. As of June 15, listed company shareholders have cumulatively increased their holdings by about 320 million shares and the value of the increase exceeds 3.5 billion yuan since April. Behind the surge in purchases and the retreat in the scale of sales in May, a rare net purchase phenomenon was generated. According to our statistics, the cumulative announced share purchases by shareholders in May approached 3.2 billion yuan, surpassing the announced share reductions of about 1.9 billion yuan in the same period. Wind data shows that the last time A-share market saw net share purchases by shareholders was in October 2008, when the total market value of shares purchased by listed companies' shareholders was 1.1 billion yuan, and the total market value of shares sold was 1 billion yuan. This means that, after 19 months, the A-share market has seen a net increase in shareholdings by shareholders. And the pace of net share buybacks in May this year was even more intense than it was in October 2008, when the stock market bottomed out. Based on our previous statistics, the surge in share purchases by listed company shareholders usually occurs during the market bottoming stage, such as in October 2005 and September 2008. This time, the major shareholder has once again pushed a new round of buying spree, which undoubtedly gives investors in the ""bear market"" a glimmer of hope. China Yangtze Power has once again become the main target of increased holdings. Observing the main ""behind-the-scenes"" forces behind this round of increased holdings, there are three major forces, namely companies, executives, and individuals. Of the 78 announcements of share purchases made since April, 71 were made by executives and companies, accounting for 91% of the total. Among them, the number of times that executives announced to increase holdings reached 46 times, ranking first. There are many companies where a large number of executives have been collectively buying back shares. Such as Nantong Science and Technology, Changhang Oil Transportation, Liuhua Shares, and so on, there are more than 10 senior executives behind each of them. Among them, the announcement of COSCO Shipping Oil Transportation showed that 13 senior executives, including Chairman Liu Xihan, Vice Chairman Zhu Ning, and General Manager Li Wanjing, repurchased their own company's stocks on May 13 and 14. The total number of shares purchased was about 570,000, with the transaction price ranging from 5.37 to 5.5 yuan. The CSRC's announcement also showed that on May 13 and 14, the company's chairman Liao Nengcheng, vice chairman and general manager Qin Yongqiang, director Su Dongsheng, and other 10 senior executives purchased about 670,000 shares in total. The number of shares held by each executive of listed companies has mostly been under 100,000 shares, with most executives only purchasing 20,000 to 30,000 shares; the executive who bought the most shares in May - Zongshen Power's chairman, Zuo Zongsheng, increased his holdings by 1 million shares, with a value of only 10.15 million yuan, and the total number of shares held by all executives was only 3.9 million shares, accounting for only 1.2% of the total increase in April, and the increase in holdings is clearly ""much ado about nothing"". Some “company” shareholders, in contrast, have been more aggressive. As of April, a total of 16 shareholders have increased their holdings in the name of ""company"", with a total of 310 million shares and a total market value of 3.46 billion yuan, accounting for 98% of the total. According to the Wind data, there were two companies that announced an increase in holdings in April, namely Jidong Cement and Zhongxing Commerce. In May, the number of companies that announced an increase in holdings rose sharply to 22, with the top two in terms of the number of increases being Yangtze River Power and Guodian Power. The former's major shareholder, the Yangtze River Three Gorges Group, announced an increase of more than 100 million shares, with an increase in value of more than 1.4 billion yuan; the latter's major shareholder, the China Guodian Group, announced an increase in the purchase of 81.53 million shares, with an increase in value of 543 million yuan. As the main force of the increase, Yangtze River Power has not taken on the role of the monthly increase champion for the first time. In January this year, the controlling shareholder of Changjiang Power, the Yangtze Three Gorges Group, increased its holdings by more than 100 million shares in the same month, becoming the leader in the increase of holdings in that month. During the previous buying spree, the group had made multiple large-scale share repurchases. Such as the more than 10 million shares purchased in August 2009 and the nearly 200 million shares purchased in July 2006, etc. This round of shareholding increase has seen 94% of shareholders make profits. We have compiled the ""account books"" of shareholders in this round of shareholding increase since April this year, and the results show that most shareholders have made good returns. In the 78 announcements of share acquisitions since April, we have excluded the acquisitions that actually occurred before the second quarter of this year. Among them, the three companies, Guodian Power, Haixian Electrical Appliances and Liuhua Shares, have implemented the profit distribution and bonus share plan after the increase of shares by shareholders. We calculated their book profit and loss according to their bonus share plan. For the rest of the listed companies, we have calculated the difference between the average cost of share purchases by shareholders and the latest share price (the closing price on June 11, the same below). The final calculation shows that 94% of the additional holdings have brought positive returns to their shareholders.

北京首证：趋势未改变短调必受限⊙北京首证两市昨日惯性低开后均呈遇阻深幅回落态势，大盘还放量击穿了短期均线，行情结束的声音随之也甚嚣尘上。但无论从量价看，还是由热点判断，惯性下探后都很可能会企稳回升，即反弹格局尚未发生逆转，昨日的重挫只是改变了运行速率而已，甚至可能成为缓解“旱情”的一场春雨。趋势未改变短调必受限虽说年线往往会得到格外的关注，沪市近日恰好遇阻于该线，但年线却远没有想象得那么重要，因为沪市已上穿12月线并站上了4季度均线，而深市则在3月便攻克了以日、周、月、季计的所有年线。近日之所以反复，关键就在于近期累计涨幅偏大(两市一个月内分别大涨近21%、27%)，可周阳线实体长度却逐渐缩短，上周五还形成阴吞阳的不良组合，指标也长时间处于高位钝化状态，这就意味着大盘实际已发生了微妙的变化，反复随时都可能会出现，特别是在近期通道上轨附近。但值得注意的，一是中期趋势(即一个多月来的低点连线)并未破坏，该线以日均约11.5点的速度上行，今日约位于2304点；二是此前上攻构成的形态出现上升楔形的诸多迹象，在难以向上拓宽空间时，市场经常就会选择向下回探趋势线的支撑，换言之，回调是修正通道(及指标过高)的需要，原始上升趋势线与3、4月之交反复时的低点以及21日均线等恰好汇聚在2300点上下，短线下探至此企稳回升可能自然就更大些。缩量是正道时势已不同前三周的量能虽持续放大，但无论周还是日成交量都没有改写年内的天量纪录，而周成交额的增幅则从四成多缩减至不足4%，且截至上周，两市自去年10月底以来的总量已高达14.5万亿，即约为2007年10月见顶后下调时总量的一半，短期反复可能自然也会有所加大。不过，这一量能标准实际上是不够的，因为市场的流通市值已经大大增加，绝对成交额以及换手率高低也就不能简单类比。与此相似，所谓前期成交密集区也不足以构成阻力，或者说这种市场压力实际已大大减轻。不仅市场容量已发生重大变化，而且由行情性质看，量能长时间居高不下也并非好事，因为巨量就是多空分歧很大的必然结果，缩量反弹才有利于行情延续得更长。所谓缩量，也绝不是说量能持续萎缩，而是说在某一合适的区间内随大盘涨跌而缩放。简单说，(周)日均成交超过2000亿很可能导致行情提早结束，若低于1500亿，上攻力度则会减弱，即1750亿左右极可能是最有利的。另外笔者认为，蓝筹整体走弱往往难以持续，短期变数因此加大，而这种变数至少是止跌企稳。	周,周阳	正向	"Beijing Shuzheng: Trend Unchanged, Short-Term Adjustments Will Be Limited ⊙ Beijing Shuzheng, both markets opened lower on惯性 yesterday and fell sharply after hitting resistance, with the major index also breaking through the short-term moving average. The voices of the end of the market have become increasingly rampant. But from the perspective of quantity and price, or by judging from the hot spots, a rebound pattern is unlikely to have been reversed, and yesterday's heavy losses only changed the operating speed, and may even become a spring rain to alleviate the ""drought"". The trend has not changed, short-term adjustments will be limited. Although the annual line is often given special attention, the Shanghai market has just encountered resistance at this line recently, but the annual line is far from as important as imagined, because the Shanghai market has already crossed the December line and stood on the 4th quarter moving average, while the Shenzhen market has already conquered all the annual lines calculated by day, week, month, and quarter. The key reason for the recent repeated fluctuations is that the cumulative increase in the past period was too large (the two markets rose by nearly 21% and 27% in a month, respectively), but the实体 length of the weekly阳线 gradually shortened, and a bad combination of 阴吞阳was formed on Friday last week. The indicators have also been in a high position for a long time, which means that the actual market has already undergone a subtle change. Repeated fluctuations may occur at any time, especially near the upper track of the recent channel. But noteworthy is that the intermediate trend (i.e. the line connecting the lows over the past one to two months) has not been broken, which is rising at a daily average of about 11.5 points, and is currently around 2304 points; secondly, there are many signs of an ascending wedge pattern formed in the previous attack, and when the market finds it difficult to expand its upward space, it often chooses to retrace the support of the trend line downward, that is to say, the correction of the channel (and the over-reading of the indicators) is needed, and the original upward trend line, the lows between March and April, and the 21-day moving average converge around 2300 points, and the short-term downward probe to this point and stabilize and recover is more likely. Reduction in volume is the right path. The trading volume in the past three weeks has continued to expand, but neither the weekly nor the daily trading volume has rewritten the record of the highest trading volume of the year. The increase in trading turnover has been reduced from over 40% to less than 4%. And by last week, the total trading volume of the two markets since the end of last October has reached 14.5 trillion, which is about half of the total trading volume when the market fell after the peak in October 2007. The short-term fluctuations are likely to increase naturally. However, this trading volume standard is actually insufficient, because the market's circulating market value has increased significantly, and the absolute trading volume and turnover rate cannot be simply compared. Similarly, what is referred to as the area of heavy transactions in the early stage is not sufficient to constitute resistance, or the market pressure has actually been greatly reduced. Not only has the market capacity undergone significant changes, but from the nature of the market, it is not a good thing for trading volume to remain high for a long time, because a large volume is a necessary result of a large difference between bulls and bears, and a volume reduction rebound is more conducive to the continuation of the market. The term ""shrinkage"" does not mean that the volume continues to shrink, but rather that it expands and contracts in a certain appropriate range in line with the ups and downs of the market. In short, daily turnover exceeding 200 billion yuan may lead to the early end of the market, while turnover below 150 billion yuan will weaken the upward momentum. Therefore, 175 billion yuan is likely to be the most favorable. The blue chips, in my view, are unlikely to remain weak overall, and the short-term variables are therefore likely to increase, but such variables are at least likely to stop the decline and stabilize."

AC米兰有柄直插心脏的匕首意媒完美领袖1个月后诞生新浪体育讯　AC米兰主场3比0大胜巴勒莫，在进球的卡卡和因扎吉背后，没有人会忽视前两个进球的助攻者——安布罗西尼。mediaset赛后给了安布罗西尼7分，除了称赞他创造一个点球、助攻因扎吉进球外，还特地加了一句：“这样的安布罗西尼已证明了今年6月1日之后他有能力成为一名完美的队长。”马尔蒂尼退役后，安布罗西尼自然而然将从现在的队副升格为第一队长。尴尬的是，安布罗西尼与AC米兰的合同在2010年6月到期，至今米兰俱乐部没有主动提出续约，如果安布罗西尼只剩下一年时间做队长，他自己难以定心，对俱乐部未来更衣室平稳过渡也没有好处。在这个微妙的阶段，安布罗西尼首先用场上表现向俱乐部表明：至少我的竞技状态是可以信任的。安布罗西尼虽已32岁，但在对巴勒莫的比赛中依然像个不知道疲劳为何物的小伙子。三球大胜巴勒莫赢得轻松，关键在于前20分钟的两个进球打垮了对手的士气。安布罗西尼从一开场就进入状态，第6分钟接到贝克汉姆的角球中路冲顶被对方阻挡。第10分钟贝克汉姆长传找因扎吉，巴勒莫后卫解围未出禁区，卡萨尼正等待球从空中落下再次解围，安布罗西尼已抢先一步跃在空中触到球，卡萨尼出脚把安布罗西尼从半空中踢倒，毫无疑问是个犯规动作。主裁判里佐利果断吹罚点球，卡卡为米兰首开纪录。十分钟后诞生了因扎吉的进球，这次配合尤为精彩。安布罗西尼中场左侧将球交给卡卡，随即向禁区内直线插入，卡卡没有停球，顺势搓出挑传，落点与安布罗西尼的跑位完全吻合，安布罗西尼左脚凌空传到后门柱，无人盯防的因扎吉原地将球顶入。这显然是米兰训练中演练过无数遍的成熟套路，三人之间的配合环环相扣，技术方面依赖卡卡的传球脚法，战术上最关键一环就是安布罗西尼坚决的纵向插入。第39分钟安布罗西尼又在左翼拉开空档，第一时间横传给中路的因扎吉，中途被博沃破坏。以安布罗西尼的身体条件从肋部强行直线冲进禁区，几乎没有人能正面阻挡，这种强硬的跑位方式同他的头球优势相似，在AC米兰整体技术化的战术中显得很生硬，但又是必要的元素。有了安布罗西尼的冲击力，AC米兰准确的传球就可以在某个环节撞开缺口，形成直接的打击，有时是通过头球摆渡，有时是通过冲击性的跑位冲开防线。上一轮5比1大胜都灵，安布罗西尼就是通过“蛮不讲理”的纵向冲击力打进一球，还创造一个点球。安布罗西尼的技术特点并不独特，世界上能冲能抢的后腰多的是，但要达到与卡卡等人之间的默契，非一朝一夕之功，就连正值当打之年的弗拉米尼打后腰时也很难起到相同的作用。两场比赛，安布罗西尼创造两个点球，另有一个进球和一次助攻，在续约谈判前充分证明了自身的价值。AC米兰需要清洗的人有很多，但安布罗西尼这样赤胆忠心又有能力的老将无论如何不应该被轻视。(定春)	巴勒莫,卡卡,因扎吉,安布罗西尼,马尔蒂尼,贝克汉姆,卡萨尼,里佐利,博沃,弗拉米尼,定春	正向	"AC Milan has a dagger straight to the heart of the media, the perfect leader will be born in a month. In the background of the goals of Kaka and Inzaghi, no one will ignore the assisters of the first two goals - Ambrosini. Sina Sports News Mediaset gave Ambrosini 7 points after the match, praising him for creating a penalty and assisting Inzaghi's goal, and added a special sentence: ""Such Ambrosini has proved that he has the ability to be a perfect captain after June 1, 2022."" After Martini's retirement, Ambrosini will naturally rise from the current vice-captain to the first captain. Ambrosini's contract with AC Milan expires in June 2010, and the Milan club has not offered a new contract. If Ambrosini is only a captain for one more year, it will be difficult for him to be at ease, and it will also be detrimental to the smooth transition of the dressing room in the future. At this delicate stage, Ambrosini first showed the club that, at least, my competitive condition is reliable. Ambrosini, 32, still played like a young man who does not know what fatigue is in the match against Palermo. The three-goal victory over Palermo was easy, the key was the two goals in the first 20 minutes, which crushed the morale of the opponent. Ambrosini got into the game from the start, heading a corner from Beckham in the 6th minute, but was blocked. In the 10th minute, Beckham sent a long ball to Inzaghi, but the Palermo defender failed to clear the ball out of the penalty area. Casani was waiting for the ball to fall from the air and clear again. Ambrosini had already leaped ahead and touched the ball in the air. Casani kicked Ambrosini from the air, which was undoubtedly a foul. Referee Rizzi decisively awarded a penalty, and Kaká opened the scoring for Milan. Ten minutes later, Inzaghi scored, and the move was particularly impressive. Ambrosini passed to Kaká in the left midfield and then inserted straight into the penalty area. Kaká did not control the ball and flicked it up with his chest, the ball falling in the exact spot where Ambrosini was running. Ambrosini sent a left-footed volley from the near post to the far post, where Inzaghi, unmarked, headed the ball into the goal. This is obviously a mature routine that Milan has practiced countless times. The cooperation between the three people is closely linked, and the technical aspect relies on Kaká's passing technique. The most critical link in tactics is Ambrosini's determined vertical insertion. In the 39th minute, Ambrosini opened up space on the left wing and immediately passed it to Inzaghi in the middle, but it was destroyed by Borriello. With Ambrosini's physical condition, it is almost impossible to block him from the ribs to the straight line into the penalty area. This kind of running positioning is similar to his advantage in heading, but it is a rough element in AC Milan's overall technical tactics, but it is also an essential element. With Ambrosini’s impact, AC Milan’s accurate passes can break through a link to form a direct attack, sometimes through a header, and sometimes through a run that breaks through the defense. In the previous round, Ambrosini scored a goal and created a penalty by charging vertically with unreasonable force, which resulted in a 5-1 victory over Torino. Ambrosini's technical features are not unique, there are many defensive midfielders in the world who can run and tackle, but to reach the默契between Kaká and others, it is not a one-day job, and even Flamini, who was in his prime, found it difficult to play the same role as a defensive midfielder. In two matches, Ambrosini created two penalties, scored one goal and made one assist, fully proving his worth before the extension of the contract negotiations. AC Milan has many players who need to be cleaned, but Ambrosini, such a loyal and capable veteran, should never be underestimated. (Ding Chun)"

九月持续反弹基金悄然减仓券商研究报告显示，超七成基金仓位上周下降8月份A股市场大幅度的急跌，让不少机构投资者的信心跌至谷底，市场情绪转向悲观。不过，9月初以来市场止跌反弹，上证指数反弹幅度超过10%，部分个股甚至反弹幅度超过50%。不过，据记者不完全统计，公募基金正在减仓。有关券商研究报告显示，公募基金9月份以来仓位递减。根据东方证券最新出炉的研究报告显示，尽管近期市场继续反弹，但基金仓位却持续向下，并且创出了近段时间以来仓位降低幅度的新低。报告称，“无论从仓位的绝对数字来看，还是从基金减仓的数量来看，都是清一色的以减仓为主要操作，反映了基金对于市场的态度并不乐观。”报告测算显示，近期北京、深圳、上海三地股票型基金的平均仓位分布比较平均，均在83%左右，较上周仓位出现显著下降，减仓行为比较一致。分基金类型来讲，股票型基金仓位从86.21%降至上周的83.75%，下降2.46个百分点。考虑市场本身的上涨对基金仓位的影响，基金主动减仓比例为2.95%，是近期以来的最大单周仓位。从基金数量上来看，超过七成基金仓位在上周下降，仅有8.7%的基金加仓。事实上，此前不少机构投资者对8月大跌的原因归结为，对前期过快上涨和较高估值的修正，以及对实际经济复苏的质疑。在9月初，不少机构对下半年行情表示悲观，投资仓位果断降低，并注重布局防御性品种。对于市场未来趋势，不少基金认为，虽然最近一阶段市场有所回升，但估计不会持续很久，更多时间内上证指数将在一定区间内做波动，最终的走向还是要取决于10月份开始陆续公布的三季报数据。国泰金马稳健基金经理程洲认为，现在国泰金马的仓位控制在75%左右，比行业水平要略低些，持仓结构偏向防御，虽然这样的配置结构在7月面临了一定压力，但现在回过头来看，防御性的策略还是非常正确的。郑实	程洲,郑实	正向	In September, the rebound funds quietly reduced their positions. According to the securities research report, more than 70% of the funds reduced their positions last week. The sharp decline of the A-share market in August has made many institutional investors' confidence fall to the bottom, and the market sentiment has turned pessimistic. However, since the end of early September, the market has stopped falling and rebounded, with the Shangzheng Index rebounding by more than 10%, and some individual stocks even rebounded by more than 50%. However, according to an incomplete statistics by the journalists, the public offering funds are reducing their holdings. According to the securities broker research reports, the stock positions of public offering funds have been reduced since September. According to the latest research report of Orient Securities, although the market continued to rebound in the recent period, the fund position continued to decline, and the reduction in position reached a new low in recent times. The report said that, whether in terms of the absolute number of positions or the number of positions reduced by funds, the main operation was to reduce positions, reflecting that funds were not optimistic about the market. The report shows that the average stock allocation of stock funds in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai in recent days is relatively even, at around 83%, which is significantly lower than the stock allocation last week, and the reduction in stock allocation is relatively consistent. In terms of fund types, the stock fund position fell from 86.21% last week to 83.75%, a decrease of 2.46 percentage points. Taking into account the impact of the market's own rise on the fund's position, the fund actively reduced its position by 2.95%, which is the largest single-week position in recent times. In terms of the number of funds, more than 70% of funds reduced their positions last week, while only 8.7% of funds increased their positions. In fact, many institutional investors have attributed the sharp decline in August to a correction of the rapid rise and high valuation in the early stage, as well as doubts about the actual economic recovery. In early September, many institutions were pessimistic about the market outlook for the second half of the year, and reduced their investment positions decisively, focusing on defensive varieties. Regarding the future trend of the market, many funds believe that although the market has recovered in the recent stage, it is not expected to last for a long time, and the Shangzheng Index will fluctuate within a certain range for most of the time, and the final trend still depends on the data of the third quarter reports that will be released in October. Cheng Zhou, the manager of Guotai Jinma Steadfast Fund, believes that the current position control of Guotai Jinma is around 75%, slightly lower than the industry level, and the holding structure is biased towards defense. Although such a configuration structure faced some pressure in July, looking back now, the defensive strategy is still very correct. Zheng Shi

The Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 30-day moving average, which sparked market expectations for a change in the market trend. However, the stock index slowly declined before the closing bell. Recent HSBC PMI preliminary data has returned above the 50 boom and bust line, and the CPI has fallen for two consecutive months, which has reduced the market's concern about a hard landing of the Chinese economy and a decline in inflation, especially Wen's mention of moderate fine-tuning has sparked market expectations of easing monetary policy, making the market shout a reversal, and investors are beginning to heat up in confusion, market risks are often generated in this way, the stock index takes the opportunity to rise, reflecting the market's anxious mentality, the stock index still has no foundation to build a bottom when the basic formation of housing prices and economic slowdown has not yet been shown, the rebound is only a process of changing the position of the stocks that are trapped, a continuous rise in stock prices provides a good opportunity for heavyweights to reduce their positions, change the position, take a rest, why not? The market's willingness to go long is not gone from the chart, and it is expected that the market will continue to oscillate and recover in the short term. However, as the height continues to rise, the upward force will gradually weaken, and the risk of chasing the rising market will gradually become apparent, but there are still some individual stocks that remain active in the market. But it is also difficult to walk out of a V-shaped rebound on a single upward trend in the short term. The market will inevitably have ups and downs in the future. The impact on the most important listed companies in A-share market, the risk of performance decline, the evolution of domestic and foreign debt risks, and the acceleration of stock market expansion have not changed, but there are signs of getting worse. Therefore, investors should adopt a cautious strategy in the market! [Macro Focus] 1. The EU 27 reached an agreement on bank capital restructuring. On October 26 (Beijing time on October 27), the EU summit reached an agreement on the bank capital restructuring plan, and the financial aid capital package may increase to 1 trillion euros. The EU summit of 27 countries reached a consensus, easing the current tense situation of the euro debt crisis, which has a significant impact on stabilizing the global stock market. But it remains to be seen whether the meeting can address the underlying risks of the eurozone debt crisis. 2 Zhou Xiaochuan: The general tone of monetary policy remains unchanged. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced on the 26th that PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said that the PBOC is closely monitoring the inflation level and will not ignore inflation because of the focus on economic growth. The current monetary policy tone remains unchanged, while maintaining sufficient flexibility and targeting. As can be seen from Governor Zhou Xiaochuan's remarks, monetary policy is still difficult to shift in the current economic situation. For A-shares, the bottom in both technical and macro aspects is emerging, but the monetary policy bottom has not yet been seen. 3. The MIIT will formulate measures to guide the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as the difficulties in production and operation of SMEs have attracted widespread attention recently. In response, Zheng Xin, director of the SME Department of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office yesterday that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is formulating policy measures to help small and medium-sized enterprises get out of the predicament. [Comment] The MIIT will formulate measures to guide the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which will have a positive impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, and related listed companies in A-share market are expected to benefit from the current trading opportunities. 4. The State Council will pilot a value-added tax reform in Shanghai next year. Premier Wen Jiabao presided over a State Council executive meeting on December 26 and decided to launch a pilot program for deepening the value-added tax system reform. The meeting decided to first pilot the reform in the transportation and some modern service industries in Shanghai. At the same time, in addition to the current standard VAT rate of 17% and the lower rate of 13%, two new lower rates of 11% and 6% will be introduced. [Comment] This reform will change the problem of excessive tax burden and repeated taxation in the service industry due to the collection of business tax, reduce the tax burden for enterprises, and also mean that modern service industries, led by the transportation industry, are expected to enter a new era of comprehensive tax cuts. Implementation of reforms will help promote the rise of the consumer industry and provide impetus for economic transformation. The A-share related service industries are expected to benefit for a long time. 5. The price of ring Bohai power coal has risen for 8 consecutive weeks. On October 26, the average price of port power coal with a calorific value of 5500 large calibers in the Bohai region was 853 yuan per ton, which has risen for 8 consecutive weeks, with a cumulative increase of 28 yuan per ton. Meanwhile, the procurement price of key power plants in East China has been rising for four consecutive weeks. The port coal price is rising continuously, but the industry is currently in a situation of having prices but no market. In the future, the upward momentum of thermal coal prices will weaken. Nevertheless, the rise in coal prices has helped coal stocks to stage a short-term rebound.

The reporter Wei Wei of the newspaper reported on February 11. It is not uncommon to send an apology message to his girlfriend, but to ask netizens to send an apology message to his girlfriend is not common. On the 10th, on a Woker online, Linyi netizen ""I love Xinxin"" posted a message online: to apologize to the girlfriend who had broken up with him on the occasion of Valentine's Day, in order to win back the three-year relationship. After the post was released, nearly a thousand netizens ""surrounded"" it, and everyone extended a friendly hand to send an apology text message to his girlfriend. So far, 583 netizens have helped ""I Love Xinxin"" send apology messages. Xinxin, ""I Love Xinxin"" has realized its mistake, please give him another chance. We all hope that you can reconcile. After the netizen ""I Love Xinxin"" posted a post online, similar apology text messages were continuously sent to ""Xinxin's"" mobile phone. Netizens, who have never met Xinxin, sent text messages to apologize to her on behalf of ""I Love Xinxin"" because they were moved by his devotion. The reporter contacted ""I Love Xinxin"", who works for a network company in Linyi, through the staff of Zhu Bajie Network. Originally, ""I Love Xinxin"" and ""Xinxin"" were college classmates, and the two have been dating for three years. Before the Spring Festival, the two people quarreled over trivial matters of sending gifts to their parents, and ""Xinxin"" proposed to break up in a fit of anger. However, ""I Love Xinxin"" felt that their long-term relationship could not be broken at will, and wanted to apologize to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day, so he posted this thread on Zhubajie.com to ask netizens to help him. In the post, the journalist saw that ""Xinxin""'s phone number was 159XXXXX142, and ""I Love Xinxin"" asked netizens to post the following content: ""Dear Xinxin, Valentine's Day is coming soon. I, on behalf of Jiang Zhen Dong, wish you a happy Valentine's Day and hope you are happy and joyful every day!"" The release time requirement is February 14, 2011, 13:14. The post attracted nearly a thousand netizens. Many netizens left messages to express their regret: ""Why did you have to do it this way if you knew the result?"" Many netizens support the idea that it's good to admit mistakes and correct them. Seeing him in such pain, I sent him a text message yesterday afternoon, which I wrote myself, hoping that Xinxin would give ""I Love Xinxin"" another chance. “Netizen” Suixin Baby said that when “Wǒ ài Xīn Xīn” first sought help, he thought that “Wǒ ài Xīn Xīn” was too blind to entrust a stranger to send a text message to the girl, which might disturb her life and instead attract resentment. Many netizens were found by the journalists to have offered advice to ""I Love Xinxin"". Some netizens suggested that ""I Love Xinxin"" should go to his girlfriend's home to show sincerity, and another netizen suggested that on Valentine's Day, he should take a bunch of roses to her workplace and wait for her to go home."
电视收视率发现造假行为缺乏第三方监督所致风险低、方式隐秘、惩戒机制缺失惟收视率与恶性竞争是主要诱因缺乏第三方监督让造假有机可乘本报北京6月30日电(记者曹玲娟、刘阳)收视率造假正在成为个别地方卫视争夺市场的“捷径”。本报记者近日在采访中获悉，与制作节目相比，“制作”收视率以其低廉的代价、隐秘且难以查证的造假方式，以及惩戒机制缺失的行业背景，正在成为个别地方卫视在激烈的市场竞争中力争上游的“幕后法宝”。据介绍，目前我国电视收视率最为可靠的统计方法是，在样本客户家庭电视机上加装类似机顶盒的收视测量仪。样本户家庭成员在收看电视时，只要在某个频道停留一定时间长度，机顶盒就会记录，生成统计数据。自2008年底全球知名调查机构尼尔森结束在中国市场的收视率调查业务以来，目前全国各电视台各大城市的所有收视率，基本由央视—索福瑞媒介研究有限公司一家出具。业内人士介绍，“收视率”作为当前全世界电视行业中的“通用货币”，由市场普遍认可的一家调查机构提供调查数据，有利于行业标准的统一和管理的规范化。然而，在这种“一家独大”的前提下，与其他国家相比，我国收视率调查过程中缺乏来自第三方的监督与相应管理惩戒机制，则为收视率造假减少了风险成本，人为操控索福瑞的样本户、“改写”收视率数据的现象已经发生。以索福瑞在某一线城市为例。据了解，该城市常住人口过千万，目前约有不到500户安装收视测量仪为索福瑞提供测量数据。由于外地卫视在该地区的收视率并不高，当地研究机构认为，一家卫视全天的收视率常态，约在0.2至0.3之间。但一些专业人士日前在分析收视数据时发现了一些不正常的收视现象。以全国部分收视测量仪城市数据为例，今年全国两会闭幕后的总理记者见面会，全国所有卫视同时直播，但某沿海地区的省级卫视收视率比其他卫视高1倍以上；玉树地震哀悼日晚上，由央视新闻频道制作的节目要求省级卫视转播，该卫视的收视率也高于央视新闻频道本身。相关人员根据测算，有些城市，只要有一户样本户，能成功提交全家全天看某特定卫视的数据，该卫视的数据就能一下子上升到0.3至0.5左右，几乎翻一倍。异动现象引起了部分电视研究机构的注意。而在之后的收视数据分析中，他们更发现确有个别电视台涉嫌行贿样本。某直辖市一位周姓出租车司机家中，在去年春季时装了一台索福瑞的测量仪。刚装完测量仪一个月左右，就有人来敲门，声称如果他们看某一卫视台节目，就会每个月得到200元的费用，且每周还会有小礼品，逢年过节还会有人登门来送大礼包。此后，收视调查机构进行现场查实确有贿赂。目前该样本户已被撤销。去年一家城市电视台向收视调查机构一次提交关于9户样本户收视率异动的怀疑，经查实，这9户样本户有6户大部分莫名长期锁定一家卫视。撤销后，该卫视在该城市的收视率即刻下降。样本污染的情况并非只存在于特定一线城市。在西安市中级人民法院向媒体公布的“2009年西安十大知识产权案”中，第十例案件便与此有关：一名索福瑞的技术维护人员王某，涉嫌与西安电视台李某、电视短剧制作人张某等人收买相关样本户，被西安市检察院起诉一审，其中王某被判有期徒刑一年零三个月，并处罚金2万元。全国多地也曾出现过收视数据异常。有数据显示，某卫视在其省会城市，黄金时段收视率远远超过其他卫视，甚至达到2.6倍有余；不止一家在全国排名靠前的卫视，在去年10月这段时间内，在该省会城市，出现无规律、多时段、零收视情况。据了解，某些卫视一年以数千万元请民营品牌推广公司进行所谓的品牌推广，而这些经费其实相当部分被用于对收视样本户的干扰造假。根据相关“污染样本”提供的信息，样本被干扰的方式比较隐蔽，多是采用定期给样本用户送大米、食用油之类的小恩小惠，让对方长期锁定该频道。	曹玲娟,刘阳,尼尔森,周,王某,李某,张某	负向	"TV ratings have found that the risk of fake behavior is low due to the lack of third-party supervision, the covert methods, and the lack of punishment mechanisms. The main诱因 is the ratings and恶性competition. The lack of third-party supervision allows fake behavior to have a way in. Beijing, June 30, 2023. (Reporter Cao Lingjuan, Liu Yang) TV ratings fraud is becoming a shortcut for some local satellite TV stations to compete for the market. Recently, the reporters learned from their interviews that, compared with making programs, ""making"" ratings, with its low cost, covert and hard-to-verify fabrication methods, and the industry background of missing punishment mechanisms, is becoming a ""secret weapon"" for some local satellite TV stations to strive for the top in fierce market competition. It is said that the most reliable method for TV ratings in China at present is to install a similar set-top box TV viewing meter on the TV of sample customer families. When the sample household members watch TV, the set-top box will record and generate statistical data as long as they stay on a certain channel for a certain period of time. Since Nielsen, a globally renowned survey agency, ended its TV rating survey business in the Chinese market at the end of 2008, CCTV-Sofres Media Research Co., Ltd. has basically issued all TV ratings in China and major cities. According to insiders, ""rating"" as the ""universal currency"" in the current TV industry worldwide, provided by a survey institution recognized by the market, is conducive to the unification of industry standards and the standardization of management. However, under the premise of ""one dominant player"", compared with other countries, the lack of supervision and corresponding management and punishment mechanisms from a third party in the process of TV ratings survey in our country has reduced the risk cost of TV ratings fraud, and the phenomenon of manipulating the sample households of Sopore and ""rewriting"" TV ratings data has already occurred. Take Sohu in a first-tier city as an example. It is understood that the city has a permanent population of more than ten million, and currently, less than 500 households have installed TV measurement instruments to provide measurement data for Sorferry. Since the ratings of the satellite TV stations from other regions in this area are not high, the local research institution believes that the normal ratings of a satellite TV station throughout the day are about 0.2 to 0.3. But some professionals have recently found some abnormal viewing phenomena when analyzing the viewing data. For example, based on the data from some cities with national TV audience measurement systems, the Premier's press conference after the closure of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference this year was simultaneously broadcast on all satellite TV stations in the country, but the ratings of the provincial satellite TV stations in a coastal region were more than twice as high as those of other satellite TV stations; on the evening of the national mourning for the Yushu earthquake, the program produced by CCTV News Channel required provincial satellite TV stations to rebroadcast, and the ratings of the provincial satellite TV station were also higher than those of CCTV News Channel itself. According to the relevant personnel, in some cities, as long as one sample household can successfully submit the data of the whole family watching a certain satellite TV for a whole day, the data of the satellite TV can rise to 0.3 to 0.5, almost doubling. The phenomenon of change has attracted the attention of some television research institutions. In the subsequent viewership data analysis, they also found that some TV stations were suspected of bribing the samples. In the home of a Mr. Zhou, a taxi driver in a direct-controlled municipality, a Sorfri measuring instrument was installed last spring. Within a month of installing the measuring instrument, someone knocked on the door, claiming that if they watched a certain TV program, they would receive 200 yuan per month, and there would be small gifts every week, and someone would also come to deliver a big gift bag during holidays. After that, the rating agency found on-site that there was indeed a bribe. The sample household has been revoked at present. Last year, a city TV station submitted a report to a rating agency about the suspicious changes in the viewing rates of 9 sample households. It was found that 6 of these 9 sample households were mostly locked on to one satellite TV station for a long time without any apparent reason. After the cancellation, the ratings of the satellite TV station in the city dropped immediately. Sample contamination is not limited to specific first-tier cities. In the “2009 Xi’an Top Ten Intellectual Property Cases” announced by the Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court to the media, the tenth case was related to this: Wang Sheng, a technical maintenance personnel of SORPO, was suspected of buying related sample households with Li Er of Xi’an TV Station and Zhang San, a TV short drama producer, and was prosecuted by the Xi’an Procuratorate for the first trial, in which Wang Sheng was sentenced to one year and three months in prison and fined 20,000 yuan. There have also been cases of abnormal ratings data in many places across the country. There is data showing that a TV station in its provincial capital city has a much higher rating during prime time than other TV stations, even more than 2.6 times; in the past October, several TV stations ranking high in the country have appeared in the provincial capital city, with irregular, multi-period, zero ratings. It is known that some satellite TV stations spend tens of millions of yuan per year on so-called brand promotion by private brand promotion companies, while a considerable portion of the funds is actually used to interfere with and falsify the viewing samples. Based on the information provided by the relevant ""polluted samples"", the way the samples were interfered with was relatively covert, mostly by sending small favors such as rice and cooking oil to the sample users regularly, locking them to the channel for a long time."
12星座爱情事业一周忠告(组图)作者/萧笑笑本文根据“每周行星预报”撰写而成，更多知识请进入星象学研究室认识我们的内在白羊：危机是奇迹的表达方式之一显然，白羊正在成为最受瞩目的区域。太阳、水星、木星和天王按照约定聚首于此，下周六火星也将加入。按照地球居民的平均寿命，人类一辈子当中只有一次机会见识如斯奇迹。我犹豫了几分钟后，还是决定使用“奇迹”这个词汇。自从日本大地震后，核辐射以及核辐射话题像细菌一样扩散到世俗生活的层面，各种复杂的情绪和反应从不见日光的暗处奔流而出。人们或者恐慌自身安全受到威胁，或者巴不得一起毁灭，或者相对平静地伺候想像中的生死。和谐富裕的科技年代里出生并成长的灵魂从未如此近距离直面物种灭亡危机，尤其该物种涉及人。这不是科幻电影，亲爱的，这是奇迹。我没有丝毫嘲讽或仇视的意思，而是深切感觉人心的麻木、冷酷和僵硬已经到达饱和的临界点，除了物极必反以外似无任何可能性。诚然，不是每一个人都能跳脱肉眼所局限的意象而直接通达无限循环。无限循环跟所谓的完结是两码事。白羊象征纯真的新生，也象征脑细胞革命。它经常被我们比喻为战士，但是，战士并不能覆盖它庞大而丰富的内蕴。换句话说，某种肤浅的程度上白羊可以充当战士，其本质却绝非战士。因为战士是有限的。它是奇迹本身。相对而言，双鱼意指穷途末路。“穷则变，变则通，通则久”的“变”是白羊。也许我们很难理解这句话。或者尝试一下打比方吧，譬如母亲第一次感受胎儿的动态，譬如男人和女人之间的理解，譬如美丽风景给我们留下深刻印象，譬如小动物对我们无偿的报答。甚至路边的树枝吐露新芽亦相当令人震撼。这些都是生命的真实意图。生命的真实意图就是奇迹。灾难不过是其中一种现象，类似函数值。而灾难之所以为灾难，因为我们将之定义为灾难。财运：带着负面能量求财，财就算到手也不如意，正面能量才是求财得财的保障白羊座一周金句：接受全部事实，惟有接受，才能流露真心。财运方面，现在是四星齐聚命宫了，且颗颗强悍，银两更是哗啦啦地往外流，部分人要留神合作事宜的财务环节，慎防对方小人心肠私吞；投资运方面，周五之前盈利形势看好，可以把握则把握，不可以把握则笑看风云。事业方面，凌乱的行星冲击暂时结束了，木星却终于拱破土壤冒头，或许这是今年第一缕关于改变现状的硝烟。之所以说是硝烟，因为不少人将在未来三周好似病急乱投医地想跳到一份新工作上，脑袋发热全然没有发觉。不过毕竟到了白羊月，机遇比之前增多，有待细心挑拣。感情方面，单身族对自己有一定了解，但也未必像自己认知的那样了解得很多，许多时候还得通过他人照见自己；已有伴儿的正跟现实或自己拔河，不过赢输都在一个念头里。贵人星座：射手座小心的星座：巨蟹座巨蟹座一周金句：永远不要幻想自己的梦想能跟他人一起完成。财运方面，上半周天王让你花钱花得畅快，下半周冥王让你花钱花得扭捏甚至不花钱了；投资运方面，周五以前亏的比赚的多，将期望值适当调低会更好。事业方面，土星对冲便是最直接的压力，压力源却是大环境下人人都想做得更好或革旧变新方便竞争。你十分忙碌，是表象；你是竞争体系里面的一棵螺丝钉，是本质。你若觉得累，绝对不是因为活计多，而是竞争必然让人疲倦。感情方面，单身族自恋得彻底些会没那么烦恼，烦恼都是自己搞不清楚自己的情感和情绪因何而生；小两口不要妄想自己能改变对方，哪怕改变一点儿都是不切实际的。贵人星座：摩羯座小心的星座：射手座处女座一周金句：心理依赖不是合作。把两个个体揉成一个个体不是合作。内心独立才是合作的基础。因为每个个体都只能为自己负责。财运方面，木星咆哮着冲向财帛宫了，大概未来三周都是非常容易破财的，但是不要紧，你的收入是有保证的；投资运方面，众多行星沸腾在此处，大起大落的幅度很大，所谓天威难测也。事业方面，人总是时不时遇见干扰题，上周题型刚答完，这周又出现新题型，题目们本意不是难倒你，而是要求你进一步回答——如何整合既得资源以便为自己的目标服务。也许这么说有点儿抽象，不过该效应持续三周，慢慢地会明白过来。感情方面，单身族的某些活结可能瞬间解开，也许得益于地球本身的转变，你想通的也正是别人想通的，尽管某些死结依然凝固；两口子看向未来总比回望过去好。贵人星座：狮子座小心的星座：天秤座射手座一周金句：缺乏名气的人，一般会期盼名气；有了点儿名气的人，一般会期盼更多名气。对名气的渴求，表面上被我们当作“可以赚钱”的借口。但是，真实的出发点却是——害怕无法生存。财运方面，木星对财帛宫一点儿都不客气，开始掠夺无数财宝了，因而你会破财，生存不仅仅是赚钱和省钱，还包括了很大程度的出钱；投资运方面，上半周比下半周更能招徕财气。事业方面，虽然行星们没有自动排列到最显著的方位上，可是土星已经对你的精神产生影响，它既是现实残酷的折射又是理智周全的培育，所以你不会像之前那样浮躁或焦虑，就好像尘埃落定或一切都定型后的行动，显得沉稳而不遗余力。感情方面，单身族已经积累足够的资粮培植桃花了，不用刻意放电也能遇见对自己有意的人；恋情男女上周为小事意见不合的情况过去了，本周想的是大事而非鸡毛蒜皮。贵人星座：金牛座小心的星座：处女座	萧笑笑	正向	"12 Astrological Signs' Love and Career Weekly Advice (Photo Series) Author/Xiao Xiaoxiao This article is written based on the ""Weekly Planetary Forecast"".

People are either panicked by the threat to their own safety, or they wish to be destroyed together, or they are relatively calm and wait for the imagined life and death. Souls born and grown up in the era of harmonious prosperity and technology have never been so close to facing the crisis of species extinction, especially when the species involved is human. This is not a science fiction movie, dear, this is a miracle. I had no intention of mockery or hatred, but rather a deep sense that the numbness, coldness, and rigidity of human hearts had reached a critical point of saturation, and there seemed to be no possibility other than a reversal of extremes. Indeed, not everyone can transcend the images limited by the naked eye and directly reach the infinite cycle. An infinite loop has nothing to do with so-called completion. The Ram symbolizes pure rebirth, and also symbolizes the revolution of brain cells. It is often compared to a warrior by us, but a warrior cannot cover its vast and rich connotations. In other words, the Aries can play the role of a warrior to a certain superficial extent, but it is far from being a warrior in essence. Because the warriors are limited. It is a miracle itself. In contrast, the Double Fish means the end of the road. The ""change"" in ""When one is at his wit's end, one must change; when one changes, one will find a way out; when one finds a way out, one can last long"" is Aries. Perhaps it is difficult for us to understand this sentence. Or try a metaphor, like the first time a mother feels the movement of her fetus, like the understanding between a man and a woman, like the beautiful scenery that leaves a deep impression on us, like the free repayment of small animals to us. Even the budding of new leaves on roadside branches is quite impressive. These are all the true intentions of life. The true purpose of life is a miracle. Disasters are merely one phenomenon, similar to function values. And it is a disaster because we define it as such. Finance: Seeking wealth with negative energy, even if the wealth is in hand, it is not satisfactory. Positive energy is the guarantee of seeking and obtaining wealth. Aries weekly golden sentence: Accept all facts, only by accepting can one show sincerity. In terms of fortune, there are four stars gathering in the wealth palace now, and they are all strong. Silver and two are flowing out in a torrent. Some people should be careful about the financial aspects of cooperation matters and be wary of the other party's small-mindedness and private appropriation. In terms of investment, the profit situation before Friday is promising. If you can seize the opportunity, you can seize it; if you cannot, you can just watch the风云. In terms of career, the chaotic planetary impact has temporarily ended, but Jupiter finally broke through the soil and emerged, perhaps this is the first whiff of change in the status quo this year. It is called smoke because many people will jump into a new job in the next three weeks as if they were desperate and feverish, without realizing it. But after all, with the arrival of the Ram month, opportunities have increased compared to before, waiting to be carefully selected. In terms of emotions, singles have a certain understanding of themselves, but they may not know themselves as much as they think they do. Many times, they still need to see themselves through others. Those who are already in a relationship are struggling with reality or themselves, but the win or loss is all in a thought. The constellation of the honored person: Sagittarius. The constellation to be careful: Cancer. Cancer's golden sentence for the week: Never imagine that your dreams can be completed together with others. In terms of financial luck, the first half of the week will allow you to spend money freely, while the second half will make you feel awkward about spending money, or even not spend any money at all. In terms of investment luck, you will lose more than you earn before Friday, and lowering your expectations will be better. In terms of career, the square of Saturn is the most direct pressure, and the source of pressure is the general desire of everyone to do better or innovate for easier competition in the macro environment. You are very busy on the surface, but in essence, you are just a screw in the competitive system. You will definitely feel tired not because of the workload, but because competition inevitably makes people tired. In terms of emotions, singletons will be less troubled if they are more narcissistic, as they will not know why their emotions and feelings arise; couples should not expect to change each other, even a little change is unrealistic. The constellation of the honored person: Capricorn. The constellation of caution: Sagittarius, Virgo. A golden sentence for the week: Psychological dependence is not cooperation. Merging two individuals into one is not cooperation. Inner independence is the foundation of cooperation. Because each individual can only be responsible for himself. In terms of wealth, Jupiter is roaring towards the wealth sector, and it is likely to be very easy to lose money in the next three weeks, but don't worry, your income is guaranteed; in terms of investment, many planets are boiling here, and the ups and downs are very large, as the saying goes, the power of heaven is unpredictable. In terms of career, people often encounter interference questions from time to time. After answering the question type last week, a new question type appears this week. The questions are not intended to defeat you, but to require you to further answer - how to integrate the resources you have obtained to serve your own goals. It may sound a bit abstract, but the effect lasts for three weeks, and you will gradually understand it. In terms of feelings, some knots of the single may be instantly untied, perhaps due to the transformation of the earth itself, and you and others may come to the same conclusion, although some knots may still be stuck; couples always look to the future rather than the past. The constellation of the honored: Leo. The constellation of caution: Libra, Sagittarius. Golden sentences of the week: People who lack fame usually expect fame; people who have a little fame usually expect more fame. The thirst for fame, which we pretend is an excuse to ""make money"". But the real starting point is – fear of not being able to survive. In terms of fortune, Jupiter is not at all generous to the wealth sector, and it starts to plunder countless treasures, so you will lose money. Survival is not just about making money and saving money, but also about spending a lot of money. In terms of investment, the first half of the week is more likely to attract wealth than the second half. In your career, although the planets are not automatically aligned to the most prominent positions, Saturn has already had an impact on your mind. It is both a reflection of the harsh reality and a cultivation of rationality. Therefore, you will not be as restless or anxious as before. It seems like actions taken after everything has settled down or everything is set, which appears steady and unremitting. In terms of emotions, singles have accumulated enough resources to cultivate romance, and they can meet people who are interested in them without deliberately discharging electricity; last week, the couple had disagreements over trivial matters, but this week they are thinking about big issues rather than trivial matters. The constellation of the honored person: Taurus. The constellation of the careful person: Virgo."
黑狗4年间接送小主人走山路上学一条普通的黑狗，4年间，每天早上护送小主人走山路去上学，晚上又按时等候在学校门口，护送小主人回家。一条狗与一个小学生相伴而行成为了偏僻大山中一道动人的风景。8月19日，崇义县文英乡古选村村民廖谨平告诉记者，他女儿廖春从上小学二年级开始，就由家里的黑狗每天护送上学放学，一直到廖春上六年级大黑狗病死为止。现在那条黑狗的孩子——小黑狗，又开始“接班”，继续做起了廖春的保镖。廖谨平家单独住在村里的一座山上，女儿每天上学需要走2个小时。由于去学校的山路很偏僻，两边都是高山密林，7岁的女儿上一年级时，一直由廖谨平接送，有时家里养的黑狗也会跟着去。廖春上二年级时，有一天放学后发现自己家的大黑早已等在了学校门口。廖谨平也发现每天吃完中饭后大黑就不知去向，原来它是去学校接小主人去了。就这样，大黑承担起接送廖春上学的任务，一晃就是4年，从未间断。去年的一天，廖春上学途中突然遇到一条蛇，大黑“嗖”地扑上去就和蛇斗了起来，最终蛇被咬死，大黑的腿也被蛇咬伤。大黑受伤后还是安全地把廖春送到了学校。回忆起与大黑在一起的日子，廖春记忆犹新地说，大黑很强壮，有它陪伴，走山路不仅不害怕了，还很有趣。有时候，走在路上她会把书包挂在大黑身上，大黑俨然成了一个顽皮的小书僮。去年12月，不幸的事发生了。大黑突然失去了往日的风采，躺在地上无精打采，病了。虽然经过主人精心的护理和医治，它还是告别了主人一家和自己的岗位。廖谨平妻子说，那条狗真有灵性，是一条好狗，这4年它为我们奉献了很多很多。它死的时候，我们都很伤心，廖春哭了整整一天。为了让它离我们近点，我们把它埋在了房子边上。如今，大黑的“儿子”——小黑，每天也按时接送廖春上学和回家。本报记者杜金存实习生秦宏	廖谨平,廖春,大黑,杜金存,秦宏	正向	"A black dog takes the little master to school on the mountain road for 4 years.A black dog, for 4 years, escort the little master to school on the mountain road every morning, and wait for the little master to go home at the school gate on time in the evening. A dog walking with a primary school student has become a touching landscape in the remote mountains. On August 19, Liao Jinping, a villager of Guxuan Village in Wenying Township, Chongyi County, told reporters that his daughter Liao Chun was escorted to and from school every day by the family's black dog since she started second grade of primary school, until the big black dog died of illness when Liao Chun was in the sixth grade. Now the black dog's child, the little black dog, has started to ""take over the job"" and continue to serve as Liao Chun's bodyguard. Liao Jining's family lives alone on a mountain in the village, and his daughter needs to walk for 2 hours every day to go to school. Since the mountain road to school was very remote, with high mountains and dense forests on both sides, Liao Jining usually took his 7-year-old daughter to school when she started first grade, and sometimes the family's black dog would go along. When Liao Chun was in Grade 2, one day after school, he found that his big black dog was waiting for him at the school gate. Liao Jinping also found that Dabai was nowhere to be seen after lunch every day, in fact, it went to school to pick up the little master. So, Dahei took on the task of picking up and dropping off Liao Chun at school, and it was four years without a break. Last year, on a day, Liao Chun was suddenly met with a snake on his way to school, Da He ""whoosh"" rushed up and fought with the snake, in the end the snake was bitten to death, and Da He's leg was also bitten by the snake. After Dahei was injured, he still safely delivered Liao Chun to school. Liao Chun, recalling the days with Dahei, said that Dahei was very strong, and with it, walking on mountain paths was not only no longer scary, but also very interesting. Sometimes, when walking on the road, she would hang her schoolbag on Dahei, and Dahei became a naughty little book-attendant. Last December, an unfortunate event occurred. Dahei suddenly lost his former luster, lying on the ground listlessly, sick. Although it was carefully tended to and treated by its master, it still said goodbye to its master's family and its own post. Liao Jinping's wife said that the dog was really intelligent, a good dog, and that it had made many contributions to us in the past four years. We were all very sad when it died, and Liao Chun cried for a whole day. To make it closer to us, we buried it next to the house. Now, Dahei's ""son"" - Xiaohēi, also picks up and drops off Liao Chun to and from school every day. Reporter Du Jinchun and intern Qin Hong"

Shandong Shenguang reported a 0.05% increase in the Dow Jones Index yesterday. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets have shifted from a bull market to a phase of mutual confrontation between bulls and bears. The major indices fluctuated today, with stocks priced at over 100 yuan, real estate, Hainan development, tourism and hospitality, steel, pharmaceuticals, and information electronics sectors leading the way. The banking sector saw a significant increase in gains. The probability of the US dollar rebounding after hitting its bottom is relatively high. The gold, rare resources, non-ferrous metals, and coal and oil sectors experienced the largest declines. In terms of market news, on October 30, the first batch of 28 original shareholders will also enter the harvest period after the lock-up period of restricted shares, with a release value of more than 30 billion yuan, accounting for more than 50% of the circulation value of the Growth Enterprise Market. The pressure of the release and reduction of the Growth Enterprise Market is strong, which will form pressure on the Growth Enterprise Market. At the 7th Cross-Straits Information Industry and Standards Forum, Vice Minister Xi Guohua of the MIIT made the above statement, and will support the whole machine and new type of flat panel display device enterprises to enjoy the tax preferential policies for high-tech enterprises, and will play the leading and driving role of the national major science and technology special projects, strengthen policy guarantee, make full use of limited resources, and transform them into productive forces. Encourage and support advantageous enterprises to acquire and reorganize, integrate resources, and become stronger and bigger. Fosun Electronics took advantage of the situation to hit the limit-up. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, enterprises with independent research and development capabilities in the integrated circuit industry will be the focus. Currently, companies with strong R&D capabilities include Obit, Huwei Electronics, Silan Microelectronics, and National People's Technology. Investors can pay long-term attention. The brightest hot spot on the plate is the pharmaceutical sector, with cases of superbugs discovered domestically, and the pharmaceutical sector opened high overall, driven by Lianhuan Pharmaceutical, Baiyunshan, Guangzhou Pharmaceutical, and others. The pharmaceutical sector rose and fell with increased volume, and there is still an opportunity to rise in the afternoon. It is recommended to continue holding.

陈金夺冠奖金预计达30万球队沾光有望获不菲赞助前晚，江苏羽毛球选手陈金历史性地拿到了世锦赛男单的金牌，江苏再次掀起一股羽毛球热。前不久，江苏羽毛球俱乐部曾一度为赞助问题而发愁，因为缺钱，俱乐部甚至产生过把陈金卖掉的念头。陈金在世锦赛上夺冠后，不少商家又重新关注起羽毛球项目。昨日，有一个企业家主动来到快报，明确表示想赞助江苏羽毛球队，希望快报牵头促成此事。当记者把这一消息转达给江苏羽毛球队总教练孙志安后，孙教练兴奋地表态，“如果真有赞助，那么我们肯定要把陈金留住。”国家省里都要奖赞助商明确奖10万随着陈金在世锦赛上夺冠，这些天，在南京，谈论羽毛球的多了，下关体校羽毛球房里更是热火朝天，所有业余球员见到陈金老爸金超，都会对他竖起大拇指，老金笑在脸上，喜在心里。大伙甚至争着要老金请吃饭，老金都会笑着答应。为了不影响儿子休息，老金没有过多打扰儿子，倒是老金的一帮朋友，争着发消息给陈金，向他道喜，懂事的陈金都会一一回复，丝毫没有明星的架子，“等陈金回来，我们一定要好好为他庆功。”老金的朋友杨总激动地告诉记者。时隔11年，南京才诞生这么一个含金量相当高的男单金牌，大家自然非常激动。市里区里的贺信不断。这一次，世锦赛夺冠，国家方面肯定要对陈金进行奖励，具体奖励多少，目前还没有明确的数字，不过，江苏队的教练说，按照以往的惯例，可能会奖励10万元，同时省里也会对陈金进行奖励，与国家标准一样。除此以外，中国羽毛球队的赞助商也明确表示，要给陈金奖10万。陈金表现好有赞助商找上门了前段时间，江苏羽毛球队总教练孙志安一直在为江苏羽毛球俱乐部的赞助问题发愁，他曾经设想，一旦赞助经费不足，希望把陈金卖掉，一来可以多一点运营经费，二来也给其他年轻队员一些机会。不过，随着陈金、蔡?在世锦赛上收获冠军，江苏众将在世锦赛上的精彩表现，让羽毛球的热度再一次在江苏升温，目前已经有企业主动找上门了，他们希望能与江苏羽毛球队进行深度合作。尽管只是意向，还没有最后签约，但这已经让江苏羽毛球队看到了一丝希望，一旦赞助经费到位，那么江苏队也就不用再为卖不卖陈金的问题发愁了，“如果有足够的赞助费，那么我们肯定会把陈金留在队中，谁也不想这么做的，很多时候也是一种无奈。”孙志安告诉记者。去年由于经费不足，江苏羽毛球俱乐部在羽毛球超级联赛中表现一般，未能闯进决赛，事实上，按照江苏队的实力，如果俱乐部有充足的运作资金，那么进决赛甚至夺冠都不是什么难事。下月回江苏期待新老冠军聚会刚刚打完世锦赛，陈金却闲不下来，他将从巴黎直接回北京，继续参加训练。因为接下来，他还需要备战全国锦标赛，以及下月中旬在江苏常州举行的羽毛球大师赛。“大师赛10号开始，在常州，到时候我肯定要去看看儿子，因为在这之前他肯定没时间回南京。”陈金老爸金超告诉记者。事实上，对于后辈陈金，南京羽毛球队的一些老前辈也非常关心，老一辈羽毛球世界冠军杨阳因为前晚看不到比赛直播，而专门打电话询问陈金老爸，怎么样才能看到，陈金拿到冠军，杨阳也为他感到高兴。事实上，老金有个想法，就是希望陈金回来，能和南京这些冠军前辈聚一聚，“杨阳、孙俊请他们来聚聚没什么问题，就怕陈金没时间回南京。”老金告诉记者。的确，除了比赛，陈金常年都在国家队集训，不知道这次回常州，距离南京这么近，陈金能否抽出一点时间，回家乡南京看看。快报记者吕远	陈金,孙志安,孙教练,金超,老金,杨总,蔡,杨阳,孙俊,吕远	正向	"Chen Jin, a badminton player from Jiangsu, won the gold medal in the men's singles at the World Championships, which is expected to bring him a prize of 300,000 yuan. The team is expected to get a generous sponsorship. The previous night, Chen Jin, a badminton player from Jiangsu, won the gold medal in the men's singles at the World Championships, which sparked a badminton craze in Jiangsu. Not long ago, the Jiangsu badminton club was once worried about sponsorship problems, because of the lack of money, the club even had the idea of selling Chen Jin. After Chen Jin won the world championship, many merchants paid attention to badminton again. Yesterday, an entrepreneur came to the Express News proactively, clearly expressing the intention to sponsor the Jiangsu Badminton Team, hoping that the Express News would take the lead to promote this matter. When the news was relayed to Sun Zhi'an, the general coach of the Jiangsu badminton team, Sun expressed his excitement, saying, ""If there is really sponsorship, we will definitely keep Chen Jin."" ""National and provincial levels will clearly reward sponsors 100,000 yuan. In recent days, in Nanjing, people talk more about badminton. In the Yiguan Sports School badminton room, it is even more heated. All amateur players who see Jin Chao, the father of Chen Jin, will give him a big thumb up. Old Jin is smiling on his face and happy in his heart. Everyone even vied to invite Old Jin to have a meal, and Old Jin would agree with a smile. In order not to disturb his son's rest, Old Jin did not bother him too much, but his friends were eager to send messages to Chen Jin to congratulate him. The mature Chen Jin would reply to each one without any star's airs. ""We must celebrate Chen Jin's success when he comes back."" Mr. Yang, an old friend of Mr. Jin, told the reporter excitedly. After 11 years, Nanjing has produced a gold medal with such high value in men's singles, and everyone is naturally very excited. Messages of congratulations from the district and the city kept coming in. This time, the championship at the World Championships will definitely reward Chen Jin. The specific reward amount is not yet clear, but according to the coach of the Jiangsu team, according to the usual practice, it may be rewarded 100,000 yuan, and the provincial government will also reward Chen Jin, the same as the national standard. In addition, the sponsors of the Chinese badminton team also clearly stated that they would give Chen Jiaoneng 100,000 yuan. Chen Jin performed well, and sponsors came to him. Recently, Sun Zhi'an, the general coach of Jiangsu badminton team, has been worrying about the sponsorship problem of Jiangsu badminton club. He once imagined that if the sponsorship funds were insufficient, he would sell Chen Jin, on the one hand to increase the operating funds, and on the other hand to give some opportunities to other young players. However, with Chen Jin and Cai winning the championship at the World Championships, the impressive performances of the Jiangsu players at the World Championships have once again raised the popularity of badminton in Jiangsu. Currently, there are already companies that have proactively approached them, hoping to engage in in-depth cooperation with the Jiangsu Badminton Team. Although it was only an intention and not the final contract, this has already given the Jiangsu badminton team a glimmer of hope. Once the sponsorship funds are in place, the Jiangsu team will no longer have to worry about whether to sell Chen Jin or not. ""If there is enough sponsorship money, we will definitely keep Chen Jin in the team. No one wants to do this, and often it is also a kind of helplessness."" Sun Zhi'an told the reporter. Last year, due to insufficient funds, the Jiangsu Badminton Club performed averagely in the Super League of Badminton and failed to advance to the final. In fact, if the club had sufficient operating funds, it would not have been difficult for the Jiangsu team to advance to the final, let alone win the championship. Next month, I look forward to the reunion of old and new champions in Jiangsu. After just finishing the World Championships, Chen Jin is still busy, and he will go straight from Paris to Beijing to continue training. Because he will have to prepare for the national championships and the Badminton Masters in Changzhou, Jiangsu, next mid-month. The Master's 10th will be held in Changzhou, and I will definitely go to see my son then, because he will definitely have no time to go back to Nanjing before that. Chen Jin's father Jin Chao told the reporter. In fact, for junior Chen Jin, some senior predecessors of Nanjing badminton team were also very concerned. Senior badminton world champion Yang Yang specially called Chen Jin's father to ask how to watch the match after he could not see the live broadcast the night before, and was happy for Chen Jin when he won the championship. In fact, Old Jin had an idea, that is, he hoped that Chen Jin could come back and meet these former champions in Nanjing. ""Yang Yang and Sun Jun invited them to have a get-together, there is no problem, but I'm afraid that Chen Jin doesn't have time to return to Nanjing."" Old Jin told the reporter. Indeed, Chen Jin has been training with the national team for years, apart from competitions. I wonder if Chen Jin can find some time to visit his hometown, Nanjing, which is so close to Changzhou.

比亚迪回归A股待批称新能源车有优势□本报记者张晓琳2009年在国家政策的推动下，车市一片大好。购置税优惠、汽车下乡、大力发展新能源、车企兼并重组等成为2009年汽车政策的关键词。昨日，《证券日报》记者独家采访了比亚迪销售公司副总经理兼新闻发言人王建钧，来解释新能源汽车的发展。国家政策推动新能源车发展《证券日报》：国家政策推动了2009年车市的火爆。具体到新能源车，国家给予了比亚迪何种优惠？王建钧：2009年初出台的《节能与新能源汽车示范推广财政补助资金管理暂行办法》中，国家对购买新能源车按照节油率和技术分级别补贴，不仅仅推动了新能源车产业的发展，还有利于引导自主品牌加快新能源车的研发与创新，促进新能源车技术的升级。这对比亚迪来说是一个很好的发展机遇，更加坚定了发展新能源汽车的决心和信心。比亚迪后续会推出多了款DM车型，包括F6DM、F0DM等，之后还会推出纯电动车型。目前，比亚迪F3DM已入选国家第一批《节能与新能源汽车示范应用工程推荐车型目录》，是轿车类唯一入选品牌。按照财政部于今年初发布的新能源车补贴办法，每一辆比亚迪F3DM将有机会争取到最高5万元的财政补贴。《证券日报》：您认为现在新能源汽车的竞争情况是怎样的？除比亚迪外，国内是否还有比较成熟的制造新能源汽车的企业？王建钧：目前，各国的汽车企业都在进行新能源车型的研发，因为新能源汽车是未来汽车发展的必然趋势，这一块的竞争也会日趋激烈。比亚迪一直坚持技术为王、创新为本的发展理念，比亚迪希望通过自己努力将这个社会变得更好、更健康，相信在新能源车领域比亚迪能够凭借自身的研发和技术取得竞争绝对优势地位，为社会创造更好的环境，打造一个绿色健康的明天。比通用、丰田有三大优势《证券日报》：作为新能源汽车领导者，比亚迪有哪些独特的竞争优势？王建钧：即使对比新能源车技术先进的通用、丰田而言，比亚迪仍有三大优势，第一，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车达到100公里行驶里程；第二，比亚迪F3DM有很强的动力性。百公里加速性能，比亚迪F3DM是10秒；第三，F3DM车实现了可插入式充电，家用220V的电源就可以进行充电。而且F3DM比丰田、通用提前实现了商品化，08年底已在国内上市。另外，比亚迪依托其产业背景，强大的垂直整合也是一大优势，比亚迪能够把电池、电控、电机技术有效结合在一起，实现了电动汽车的商业化运作。同时，比亚迪DM双模电动车还突破了反复充电、家用插座充电两大技术难关并且确保安全耐用。.《证券日报》：刚才您说比亚迪F3DM双模电动车已经入选国家第一批《节能与新能源汽车示范应用工程推荐车型目录》，但是很多消费者对这款双模电动车还不够了解，能否介绍一下这款车，双模电动车比一般车型有何优势？王建钧：与传统的燃油汽车相比，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车有以下两个特殊的优势：优越动力性能：F3DM搭载了BYD371QA全铝发动机，双模电动车驱动系统大幅度的提高了电机的功率和扭矩，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车最大输出功率达到了125KW，相当于拥有3.0L发动机的优越动力性能，将给驾驶者带来一种全新的驾驶快感。此外，在起步阶段，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车超强的瞬间加速性能，远超过3.0L级别的发动机所能达到的水平。使用成本低廉：在燃油经济性方面，F3DM双模电动车纯电动状态下百公里耗电仅为16度，电费按0.6元/kwh计算，其行驶100公里的花费约为9.6元人民币。DM双模动力系统采用的比亚迪最新发动机，使得系统中的发动机在任意工况下的最低燃油消耗率不足250g/kwh。而且相关调查显示，超过90%的人每天用车不超过100公里，这意味使用比亚迪DM双模电动车，绝大部分人将远离油价高企的困扰。因为用电的成本仅为使用燃油的1/4，对消费者来说，这无疑是一种绝对经济的选择。《证券日报》：新能源汽车科技攻关点有三方面：电池能力、发动机系统和电控系统，比亚迪在那个方面最为成功，在这三个方面比亚迪有何科研成果？王建钧：电池能力：比亚迪在新能源汽车领域采用了最先进的铁电池技术，引领了汽车动力的技术革新。汽车动力电池难在“高安全”、“低成本”、“长寿命”、“绿色环保”、“复杂工艺”等五个要求上。而比亚迪的“铁电池”在上述五个指标上都取得了突破。发动机系统：在上一问题中已经进行了阐述。电控系统：F3DM双模电动车搭载的是全球首创的DM双动力混合系统。DM为DUALMODE的缩写。DM双模电动车采用电动车系统(EV)和混合动力系统(HEV)。是一种将控制电机和电动机两种混合力量相结合的先进技术，不仅降低了油耗及排放，更极大的提高了动力和操控性能，实现了既可充电，又可加油的多种能源补充方式，实现了真正意义的双动力混合系统。已申报回归A股《证券日报》：比亚迪是否有回归A股的打算？王建钧：比亚迪在2009年7月发布公告明确比亚迪正在依据中证监相关法规按照流程进行申报，待有关部门批准后，拟赴深圳上市，发行不多于1亿股的A股，所得资金将用于拨付锂离子电池生产、汽车研发、扩展汽车产品及汽车零部件以及太阳能电池项目。比亚迪相信发行A股将为公司建立新融资平台，并可令公司扩展至不同证券市场，从而确保公司加强业务发展及进一步提高竞争力。《证券日报》：2009年比亚迪的销售情况如何？由于汽车批量生产能够大大降低成本，在2010年及未来的销售目标是怎样的？王建钧：2009年比亚迪汽车全年实现销售突破45万辆，超出预期的40万辆目标，同比增幅达162%，同时实现销量连续六年100%的增长。从2009年市场表现看来，功勋车F3连续月销突破3万辆，成为中国车市唯一“3万辆俱乐部”成员；F6新财富版，月销量超过6000辆；高端精品小车F0月销万辆以上，成为新一代微车王；新上市的中级精品家轿G3，也随着产能的提升，市场潜力进一步释放，冲击月销万辆。以上车型也有望在2010年持续放量增长，为比亚迪达成市场目标贡献力量。比亚迪计划在2010年推出L3、I6、G6、S6、M6等5款全新重磅车型，并通过致力于产品品质的完美提升，力争实现2010年80万辆的产销计划，力争再次实现100%的跨越增长。其中，L3、I6、G6、S6、M6等5款新车将担负17万辆的销售目标，进一步为经销商提供强有力新车支持。M6作为比亚迪首款高端全尺寸MPV，在伴随经济启稳迎来最佳上市时机，将在全网销售；L3已经登上最新一批国家新车目录，将是比亚迪又一款高端中级车；全新的G6、S6、I6等高端产品也将在2010年揭开神秘面纱。	张晓琳,王建钧	正向	"Bye-Bye BYD Returns to A-share Market, New Energy Vehicles Have an Advantage□Zhang Xiaolin,Reporter of China Business News2009, with the promotion of national policies, the car market was booming. Tax incentives for car purchases, the promotion of new energy vehicles, and the mergers and reorganizations of auto companies became the key terms of the auto policy in 2009. Yesterday, Securities Daily reporters interviewed Wang Jianjun, vice president of sales and spokesperson of BYD, exclusively to explain the development of new energy vehicles. National Policies Promote the Development of New Energy Vehicles: Securities Daily: National policies have fueled the booming car market in 2009. What kind of preferential policies has the state given to BYD in terms of new energy vehicles? Wang Jianjun: The fiscal subsidy management measures for energy-saving and new energy vehicles, which were introduced at the beginning of 2009, stipulated that the state would subsidize the purchase of new energy vehicles according to the fuel-saving rate and technical level, not only promoting the development of the new energy vehicle industry, but also guiding domestic brands to accelerate the research and innovation of new energy vehicles, and promoting the upgrading of new energy vehicle technology. This is a good opportunity for BYD, which further strengthens its resolve and confidence in developing new energy vehicles. BYD will launch more DM models in the future, including F6DM and F0DM, and will also launch pure electric models later. Currently, the F3DM of BYD has been included in the first batch of the ""Recommended Vehicle Model Directory for Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Demonstration and Promotion Projects"" of the country, and it is the only brand included in the sedan category. According to the new subsidy policy for new energy vehicles issued by the Ministry of Finance at the beginning of this year, each F3DM car produced by BYD has the opportunity to apply for a maximum subsidy of 50,000 yuan. The Securities Daily: How do you think the competition situation of new energy vehicles now is? Are there any other domestic companies that are relatively mature in manufacturing new energy vehicles besides BYD? Wang Jianjun: Currently, car companies around the world are developing new energy vehicles, because new energy vehicles are the inevitable trend of future car development, and competition in this area will become increasingly fierce. BYD has always adhered to the development concept of technology as king and innovation as the foundation. BYD hopes to make the world a better and healthier place through its own efforts. It believes that in the field of new energy vehicles, BYD can achieve an absolute competitive advantage through its own research and development and technology, creating a better environment for society and building a green and healthy tomorrow. Three advantages over General Motors and Toyota. Securities Daily: As a leader in new energy vehicles, what unique competitive advantages does BYD have? Wang Jianjun: Even compared with General Motors and Toyota, which are advanced in new energy vehicle technology, BYD still has three advantages. First, BYD F3DM can reach 100 kilometers driving range. Second, BYD F3DM has strong power. The 0-100 km/h acceleration performance of F3DM is 10 seconds; third, F3DM can be charged by plugging in, and can be charged with a household 220V power supply. And F3DM was commercialized earlier than Toyota and GM, and was launched in the Chinese market by the end of 2008. Moreover, based on its industrial background, BYD’s strong vertical integration is also a major advantage. BYD can effectively integrate battery, electric control, and electric motor technologies, achieving commercial operation of electric vehicles. Meanwhile, BYD’s DM plug-in hybrid has overcome the technical challenges of repeated charging and charging from domestic sockets, and ensures safety and durability. . Securities Daily: You just said that the F3DM dual-mode electric car of BYD has been included in the first batch of ""Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Demonstration Application Model Directory"" of the country. However, many consumers are not very familiar with this dual-mode electric car. Could you introduce this car and what advantages does the dual-mode electric car have over ordinary cars? Wang Jianjun: Compared with traditional fuel cars, F3DM from BYD has two special advantages: superior power performance: F3DM is equipped with BYD371QA all-aluminum engine, and the dual-mode electric vehicle drive system greatly improves the power and torque of the motor. The maximum output power of BYD F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle reached 125KW, which is equivalent to the superior power performance of 3.0L engine, and will bring a new driving pleasure to the driver. In addition, at the initial stage, the F3DM plug-in hybrid electric vehicle from BYD has a much stronger instantaneous acceleration performance than that of engines of 3.0L level. Cost-effective to use: In terms of fuel economy, the F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle consumes only 16 kWh per 100 kilometers in pure electric mode. With an electricity price of 0.6 yuan/kWh, the cost of driving 100 kilometers is about 9.6 yuan RMB. The DM dual-mode power system adopts the latest engine of BYD, which makes the fuel consumption rate of the engine in the system less than 250g/kwh under any operating condition. And the relevant survey shows that more than 90% of people travel less than 100 kilometers per day, which means that most people will be free from the high oil price with the use of BAIC New Energy DM dual-mode electric vehicles. Since the cost of electricity is only one quarter of that of fuel, it is undoubtedly an absolutely economical choice for consumers. The Securities Daily: There are three aspects of technological breakthroughs in new energy vehicles: battery capacity, engine system and electronic control system. Which aspect is the most successful for BYD, and what scientific and technological achievements has BYD made in these three aspects? Wang Jianjun: Battery capacity: BYD adopted the most advanced iron battery technology in the new energy vehicle field, leading to technological innovation in automotive power. Automobile power batteries are difficult in five aspects: high safety, low cost, long life, green and environmental protection, and complex process. And BYD's ""iron battery"" has made breakthroughs in all five of the above indicators. Engine system: It has been explained in the previous question. Electric control system: F3DM is equipped with the DM dual power hybrid system, which is the world's first. DM is the abbreviation of DUALMODE. DM dual-mode electric vehicles adopt electric vehicle systems (EV) and hybrid systems (HEV). It is an advanced technology that combines the control of electric motors and motors, not only reducing fuel consumption and emissions, but also greatly improving power and handling performance, achieving multiple energy replenishment methods that can be charged and refueled, and realizing a true dual power hybrid system. Has BDI declared its intention to return to the A-share market? Securities Daily: Does BDI have any intention of returning to the A-share market? Wang Jianjun: BYD announced in July 2009 that it was in the process of applying for listing in Shenzhen in accordance with the relevant regulations of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the funds raised would be used for the production of lithium-ion batteries, automobile research and development, expansion of automobile products and automobile parts, and solar cell projects. BYD believes that the issuance of A-shares will establish a new financing platform for the company, and enable the company to expand into different securities markets, thereby ensuring that the company strengthens its business development and further enhances its competitiveness. The Securities Daily: How was BYD's sales in 2009? Due to the mass production of cars can greatly reduce costs, what are the sales targets in 2010 and the future? Wang Jianjun: BYD's sales of cars exceeded the expected 400,000 units in 2009, reaching 450,000 units, with a year-on-year increase of 162%, and sales have grown by 100% for six consecutive years. Based on the market performance in 2009, the model F3, a model of honor, sold more than 30,000 units per month, becoming the only member of the ""30,000 Club"" in the Chinese car market; the F6 New Wealth Edition sold more than 6,000 units per month; the premium small car F0 sold more than 10,000 units per month, becoming the king of the new generation of micro cars; the new mid-range premium family car G3, with the increase in production capacity, further released market potential, and challenged the sales of 10,000 units per month. These models are also expected to continue to grow in volume in 2010, contributing to BAIC's market targets. BYD plans to launch five new heavy-weight models, L3, I6, G6, S6 and M6, in 2010, and aims to achieve a production and sales target of 800,000 units in 2010 by striving for a perfect improvement in product quality, and aims to achieve another 100% leap growth. Among them, the new models L3, I6, G6, S6, and M6, etc., will bear the sales target of 170,000 units, further providing strong support for dealers with new models. M6, as BYD's first premium full-size MPV, will be launched at the best time when the economy is stabilizing, and will be sold online. L3 has already entered the latest batch of national new car directories, and will be another premium mid-size car for BYD. The new G6, S6, I6 and other premium products will also be unveiled in 2010."
阿联连续3季得分500+篮板300+他正提速追赶姚明!新浪体育讯　北京时间3月30日，新泽西篮网坐镇主场IZOD中心，迎战圣安东尼奥马刺。最终，篮网以90-84击败马刺，易建联上阵31分钟，拿下8分、7个篮板。这场比赛是篮网本赛季的第10场胜利，他们凭借这场胜利彻底摆脱了NBA史上最差战绩纪录，而对阿联个人来说，这场比赛也颇具深意。本场比赛之前，阿联本赛季的总得分已经达到510分，篮板296个，只需要再抢4个篮板，他就可以连续第三个赛季完成单季得分500+和篮板300+的数据。要知道，此前在NBA能够达到以上数据的中国球员，只有休斯顿火箭的姚明一个。在自己的新秀赛季，阿联代表密尔沃基雄鹿出战66场比赛，最终拿到了566分、344个篮板；第二个赛季，刚刚转投篮网的阿联，出战61场比赛，最终拿到525分、326个篮板；本赛季，阿联频繁遭遇伤病，到目前为止仅出战44场比赛，如果剩余的8场比赛他全部参加，那么加起来也仅为52场比赛，必定创造个人NBA职业生涯的出勤率新低。但是，通过以上的数据对比我们不难看出，前两个赛季需要出战60场以上，阿联才能拿到得分500+和篮板300+，而如今出战40场以上，阿联就已经拿到了。因此，如果说阿联的第三季没有进步，显然是错误的，阿联已经提高了效率，变得更为高产。当然，和姚明连续7个赛季完成单季得分1000+和篮板400+的壮举相比，阿联还有很长的一段路要走，但是他至少已经证明，中国球员中并不是只有姚明一个能够真正立足NBA，他绝对不会是个NBA的匆匆过客。Yahoo体育近期曾表示，如何完成本赛季最后9场比赛(现为8场)，将是阿联这个因为伤病变得支离破碎的赛季最为关键的考评，倘若阿联能够强势收尾，必定可以给篮网足够的信心，选择在新赛季继续把他留在阵中。　今天，阿联忍着右肩的疼痛，在第四节投中了反超比分的一球，帮助篮网赢得了胜利，相信在后面8场比赛里，他也会继续证明自己的价值。(一分钱)	阿联,姚明,易建联	正向	In the last three seasons, Ahli has scored 500 points and grabbed 300 rebounds. He is accelerating to catch up with Yao Ming! On March 30, the New Jersey Nets played at home at the Izod Center against the San Antonio Spurs. In the end, the Nets beat the Spurs 90-84. Yi Jianlian played for 31 minutes, scoring 8 points and grabbing 7 rebounds. This game was the Nets' 10th victory of the season, and they broke away from the worst record in NBA history with this victory. For Yi Jianlian personally, this game also had a deep meaning. Before this game, Alin's total points and rebounds in this season have reached 510 and 296, respectively. He only needs to grab 4 more rebounds to complete the data of 500+ points and 300+ rebounds in the third consecutive season. To know that, before this, only Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets was a Chinese player who could reach the above data in the NBA. During his rookie season, Zhou Yuan represented the Milwaukee Bucks and played in 66 games, eventually scoring 566 points and grabbing 344 rebounds; in his second season, after joining the Nets, Zhou Yuan played in 61 games and eventually scored 525 points and grabbed 326 rebounds; in this season, Zhou Yuan frequently suffered from injuries, and so far he has only played in 44 games. If he participates in all the remaining 8 games, the total will be only 52 games, which will definitely set a new low for his attendance rate in his NBA career. But, through the above data comparison, it is not difficult to see that in the first two seasons, more than 60 games were needed for the team to score 500+ and 300+ rebounds, while now more than 40 games, and the team has already achieved it. So it is clearly wrong to say that Zhou Yuan’s third season in the league did not progress; he has improved his efficiency and become more productive. Of course, compared with Yao Ming's feat of scoring 1000+ and grabbing 400+ rebounds in a season for seven consecutive seasons, it will take a long time for Han to catch up, but at least he has proved that there is not only Yao Ming who can really make it in the NBA, he will never be a fleeting passer-by in the NBA. Recently, Yahoo Sports said that how to complete the last 9 games of the season (now 8 games) will be the most important evaluation of Zhou Yuan's season, which was broken by injury. If Zhou Yuan can finish strongly, it will definitely give the Nets enough confidence to choose to keep him in the team for the new season. Today, despite the pain in his right shoulder, Alen scored a three-pointer to take the lead in the fourth quarter, helping the Nets win the game. It is believed that in the next 8 games, he will continue to prove his value. (A penny)
热点聚焦：“猪流感”会影响加美移民吗近日有网友提问：猪流感会影响移民吗？虽然移民行业是以政策为导向，目前还没有看到主流的移民国家因猪流感而专门提出修改或调整移民政策的通告，但因为猪流感而引起的与日常生活相关的系列问题正在发酵。截至北京时间28日晚，墨西哥确诊和疑似死于猪流感的人数已上升至152人，疑似感染者已近2000名。针对当前猪流感的蔓延趋势，世界卫生组织已经将流感大流行警告级别从之前的3级提高到4级，“第4级”意味着一种新病毒在人际间传播，可以引起“群体性”暴发。据报道，为防患于未然，世界多个国家已经启动应急措施，并对从美国本土、加拿大和墨西哥抵达本国的直飞航班，实施机舱内的红外体温检测，防范猪流感入境引发可能的大流行。美国、加拿大作为老牌移民国家同时成为本次猪流感的重灾区，从现阶段来看，在一定程度上难免造成近期登陆的客人心理上的恐慌，从长远来看，一次临时的病毒性传染症应该不会对移民行业造成影响。更有网友戏谑的说：现阶段如果是猪要办理移民的话才会被禁止登陆。目前，世卫组织也依然没有建议采取限制旅行和关闭边界的应对措施，因此，笔者建议大家不要担忧，如果有移民的意愿，抓紧在这金融危机移民政策相对宽松的时期及时办理移民申请。		正向	"Focus on hot topics: Will the swine flu affect immigration to Canada and the United States? Recently, a netizen asked: Will the swine flu affect immigration? Although the immigration industry is policy-oriented, there has been no mainstream immigration country that has issued a notice to modify or adjust immigration policies due to the swine flu so far, but a series of problems related to daily life caused by the swine flu are fermenting. As of 28 p.m. Beijing time, the number of people who have died from swine flu in Mexico and those who are suspected of dying from it has risen to 152, and the number of suspected cases has approached 2,000. In view of the current trend of the spread of swine flu, the World Health Organization has raised the warning level of the flu pandemic from 3 to 4. ""Level 4"" means that a new virus is spreading among people, which can cause ""epidemic"" outbreaks. It is reported that in order to prevent the swine flu from entering and causing a possible large-scale outbreak, many countries around the world have already launched emergency measures and implemented infrared temperature detection in the cabins of direct flights from the United States, Canada and Mexico. The United States and Canada, as old-time immigration countries, have become the worst-hit areas of the current swine flu. To a certain extent, it is inevitable that the recent guests will be panic-stricken. In the long run, a temporary viral infectious disease should not affect the immigration industry. Some netizens jokingly said that if pigs were to apply for immigration at present, they would be banned from landing. Currently, the WHO has not yet recommended travel restrictions and border closures as a response, so I suggest that you do not worry, and if you have the intention to immigrate, you should seize the opportunity to apply for immigration during the period when the immigration policies are relatively relaxed due to the financial crisis."

德法首脑会在即希腊7月或将获救援汇通网6月17日讯——周四(16日)欧元/瑞郎触及纪录低位，因市场担忧希腊债务问题有可能进一步恶化，且政府将不能就紧缩措施达成共识。然而在欧盟(EU)经济与货币理事瑞恩(OlliRehn)发表乐观言论后，欧元削减跌幅。瑞恩称，希腊只要削减预算，就能在7月份获得欧盟和国际货币基金组织(IMF)的贷款。IMF也在声明中表示支持瑞恩。荷兰国际集团(INGGroepNV)驻纽约货币交易主管JohnMcCarthy称：“我们看到全球经济数据普遍疲软，加之对希腊债务的忧虑仍然弥漫市场，两者对风险情绪皆不利，这也是市场抛售欧元的另一个原因。”新西兰银行(BankofNewZealandLtd。)货币策略师MikeBurrowes指出，如果风险情绪继续弥漫市场，并且市场对欧元区债务问题的担忧无法缓解的话，预计欧元/美元将继续承压走低，而美元、瑞郎和日元将从避险买盘中受益。欧元/瑞郎目前交投于1.2025附近，较上个交易日下跌0.60%，盘中刷新纪录低位1.1946；另外欧元/美元目前交投于1.4150附近，较上个交易日下跌0.14%，盘中触及5月26日以来最低1.4073。高盛集团公司(GoldmanSachsGroupInc。)首席货币策略师ThomasStolper在一次电话会议中指出，瑞郎兑欧元已成为最被高估的货币对。在紧缩计划遭到反对党的反对后，希腊总理帕潘德里欧(GeorgePapandreou)今日将重组内阁并试图重新赢得公众的信任票。欧盟理事瑞恩在“密切接触”IMF之后确信周末的会议将通过一项决议，那就是只要希腊能够削减预算，就将在7月份获得120亿欧元的援助。为了避开欧元区的首次违约，作为去年一揽子救援计划的一部分，今年7月份欧盟将为希腊提供87亿欧元，另外33亿则由IMF提供。IMF的一位女代言人CarolineAtkinson周四在一封电子邮件中声明：“有关对希腊救助的讨论正在取得进展，以确保获取充分的融资项目，我们期望在下一次欧元集团会议中能有积极的结果。”德意志银行(DeutscheBankAG)10国集团(G10)驻纽约全球首席外汇策略师AlanRuskin称：“随着希腊在7月份获得援助出现一线希望，市场风险偏好情绪也有了些许好转。”德国总理默克尔(AngelaMerkel)与法国总理萨科齐(NicolasSarkozy)明日将在柏林举行会议，致力于就希腊一揽子援助计划达成一致。高盛预期，欧元/美元在未来3、6、12个月的汇价分别为1.45、1.50和1.55。	瑞恩,JohnMcCarthy,MikeBurrowes,ThomasStolper,帕潘德里欧,CarolineAtkinson,AlanRuskin,默克尔,AngelaMerkel,萨科齐,NicolasSarkozy	正向	"German and French leaders are about to meet, and Greece may receive aid in July.

However, the euro pared losses after Olli Rehn, the EU’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, issued optimistic remarks. Ryan said that Greece could get a loan from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July if it cut its budget. The IMF also stated its support for Ryan. John McCarthy, head of currency trading at ING Groep NV in New York, said, ""We are seeing generally weak global economic data, coupled with lingering concerns about Greek debt, which are both detrimental to risk sentiment, and this is another reason for the market to sell euros."" ""Bank of New Zealand Ltd."" of New Zealand. Mike Burrowes, a currency strategist, notes that if risk sentiment continues to dominate the market and concerns over the eurozone debt problem cannot be alleviated, the euro / US dollar is expected to continue to be under pressure and decline, while the US dollar, franc, and yen will benefit from risk-on buying. The EUR/CHF is trading around 1.2025, down 0.60% from the previous trading day, and hitting a record low of 1.1946 during the session; meanwhile, the EUR/USD is trading around 1.4150, down 0.14% from the previous trading day, and hitting the lowest level since May 26, 1.4073. GoldmanSachsGroupInc. Thomas Stolper, chief currency strategist, pointed out in a conference call that the franc against the euro has become the most overvalued currency pair. After the austerity program was opposed by the opposition party, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will reshuffle the cabinet today and try to win back the public's trust vote. Ryan, the EU Council, was convinced after a ""close contact"" with the IMF that the meeting over the weekend would adopt a resolution that Greece would receive 12 billion euros in aid in July, as long as it could cut its budget. To avoid Greece's first default in the eurozone, the EU will provide 87 billion euros to Greece in July this year as part of a package of rescue measures last year, and another 33 billion euros will be provided by the IMF. Caroline Atkinson, a female spokesperson for the IMF, stated in an email on Thursday: ""Discussions on Greece's rescue are making progress to ensure that sufficient financing programs are in place. We expect positive results at the next Eurogroup meeting."" Alan Ruskin, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG, a G10 bank based in New York, said that as Greece began to see some hope of assistance in July, market risk appetite also improved slightly. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Berlin tomorrow to work towards an agreement on a package of aid for Greece. Goldman Sachs expects the euro/dollar exchange rate to be 1.45, 1.50 and 1.55 in the next 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively."

欧盟成员国仍未就解除对华军售达成一致中国日报网消息：英文《中国日报》2月5日报道：欧盟国家仍未就是否解除对华军售达成一致，匈牙利外交部长昨日在重庆表示。该国外长BalázsPéter指出，是否解禁需要欧盟27个成员国协商决定，“而问题在于解除的条件是否满足”。“确实，这个问题非常敏感，”Péter外长告诉中国日报。“我们(成员国)需要进行讨论。看条件是否满足，在什么时机要满足什么条件，”他表示，但没有详细说明。1989年欧盟开始对华实行武器禁售，但上个月自从西班牙开始担任为期半年的欧盟轮值主席国后，对这一热点的讨论很激烈。西班牙外长MiguelAngelMoratinos1月26表示该国正对欧盟对华禁售武器的“优缺点进行衡量”。Moratinos外长补充，除了西班牙外，法国一直是主要的支持取消该禁令的国家，而“西班牙正加入这一支持取消的队列”。早期西班牙驻华大使CarlosBlascoVilla也告诉中国日报，该国“希望能进一步讨论取消这一禁令”。但是匈牙利外长Péter昨日指出，所有的欧盟成员国在此问题上必须达成一致。“我们与欧盟其它26个成员国结成了密切的同盟。我们有义务就相应取消禁运的相关步骤与26个国家进行讨论”，他在昨日匈牙利驻中国西南地区重庆市总领馆开幕仪式后说。尽管部长表明匈牙利并不赞成限制贸易，但武器是“敏感的产品，与和平及稳定紧密相连。”“这需要27个国家来决定。与当时只有6个组建国相比，欧盟现在变得越为复杂。我们必须与欧洲的伙伴国达成共识，”他补充。不仅如此，一家商业信息服务网站Eubusiness.com援引未透露姓名的外交官表示，出于安保方面的影响，欧盟对解除禁运有所保留，除非是和美国同步进行才行。但是乔治·华盛顿大学教授、现中国社科院访问学者DavidShambaugh并不认为美国会对中国和欧盟在此问题上产生影响。“这个问题还没有定论，但我认为禁运不会解除”，而且这一国家集团并未达成一致，Shambaugh昨日在欧盟驻华代表团活动下说。他表示，中欧各国(包括匈牙利)以及北欧斯堪地纳维亚各国都并不赞同取消禁令。而欧盟其它大国如德国和英国也尚未做出决定。然而，解禁将大幅提升中国和欧盟的关系，中国社科院欧洲研究所分析员赵晨指出。“解除对华武器禁运更多来说是一个政治议题，而非纯军事问题。”赵晨说中东欧一些国家由于没有什么军工厂，因为无法从解禁中获得什么实在的好处。而反对解禁，也因为这些国家仍然在从价值观的角度来看待今天的中国。不过如果武器禁运被解除，“将会是中欧关系全面回暖的一个重要迹象，”赵晨说。(中国日报记者张海洲于北京王化中于重庆报道)	BalázsPéter,CarlosBlascoVilla,乔治·华盛顿,DavidShambaugh,Shambaugh,赵晨,张海洲,王化中	正向	"EU member states have yet to reach a consensus on lifting the arms embargo on China. According to China Daily, Hungarian Foreign Minister said yesterday in Chongqing that EU countries have yet to reach a consensus on whether to lift the arms embargo on China. BalázsPéter, the foreign minister of the country, pointed out that whether to lift the ban requires the 27 EU member states to negotiate and decide, ""and the problem is whether the conditions for lifting the ban are met."" “Indeed, this is a very sensitive issue,” Péter, the foreign minister, told China Daily. We (member states) need to have a discussion. He said to check whether the conditions are met and when they should be met, but did not elaborate. The EU began an arms embargo against China in 1989, but discussions on this issue have been intense in recent months since Spain took over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU last month. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said on January 26 that his country was weighing the pros and cons of the EU’s ban on arms sales to China. Moratinos added that, in addition to Spain, France has been the main country supporting the lifting of the ban, and that “Spain is joining the ranks of those supporting its lifting.” Early Spanish ambassador to China, Carlos Blasco Villa, also told China Daily that the country ""hopes to further discuss the lifting of this ban."" But Hungary's foreign minister Péter stressed yesterday that all EU member states must reach a consensus on this issue. We have a close alliance with the other 26 EU member states. We have the obligation to discuss with 26 countries the relevant steps for lifting the embargo,"" he said after the opening ceremony of the Hungarian Consulate General in Chongqing, Southwest China. Though the minister indicated that Hungary did not support trade restrictions, weapons are “sensitive products closely linked to peace and stability.” It requires 27 countries to decide. Compared with the EU of just six founding countries at the time, it has become more complex. We must reach an agreement with our partner countries in Europe, "" he added. Moreover, according to an unnamed diplomat cited by a business information service website, Eubusiness.com, the EU is reluctant to lift the embargo for security reasons, unless it is done in tandem with the US. But David Shambaugh, a professor at George Washington University and a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, does not believe that the US will have an impact on China and the EU on this issue. There is no consensus on this issue, but I believe the embargo will not be lifted,"" Shambaugh said at an event of the EU delegation in China yesterday, and the group of countries has not reached an agreement. He said that neither Central European countries (including Hungary) nor the Nordic Scandinavian countries agreed to lift the ban. And neither Germany and the UK, the other major EU countries, have made a decision yet. However, the lifting of the ban will significantly improve the relationship between China and the EU, Zhao Chen, an analyst from the European Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out. The lifting of the arms embargo on China is more of a political issue than a purely military one. Zhao Chen said that some countries in Central and Eastern Europe could not benefit much from the lifting of the ban because they had no military factories. And those who oppose easing the ban do so because these countries still view China today through the lens of values. But if the arms embargo is lifted, it would be a major sign of a full warming of Sino-central European relations, Zhao said.

甘肃舟曲男子将三轮车改制成皮筏救出74人故事1：自制皮筏，下江救人这是一个在灾民中口口相传的故事：一位三轮车司机依靠自制皮筏救出了74个人。江盘乡南桥村的三轮车司机王明昌依靠三轮车运营为生，8月7日晚，王明昌因为与朋友聚会，没有在房内睡觉，因此躲过一劫。当他回到家里时，两层小楼已被泥石流夷为平地，周围一片哀嚎声。王明昌看到不少房子还被泥石流冲到了江里，一些灾民登上废墟高处正在呼救。王明昌想起了自己营生的三轮车，于是将三个轮子拆下，拿来木板扎成了一个简陋的皮筏子。舟曲的青峰宾馆被泥石流冲下白龙江，不少旅客在窗户边上探出头来，不断呼救。王明昌撑着小艇冲下江去，面对汹涌的江水，不知是熟悉驾驶这一行，还是救人的执着战胜了恐惧，王明昌很快掌握了小皮筏的秘诀。小皮筏每次只能救一两个人，王明昌就一次次地来回救人，足足救了74个人。王爱强和王彩强是王明昌的邻居，灾难发生后，他们没有顾及家中的财产抢救，也第一时间加入到救人的队伍里。有三个灾民被困在堰塞湖的崖边，只能紧紧地抓住崖边的石头才没有落入江中，情况十分危急。王爱强兄弟挨家挨户借来绳子，再把绳子连着一起，接到了50米长。王爱强兄弟拿着绳子来到堰塞湖崖边，将绳子套住灾民，再慢慢放到王明昌的小皮筏上。这三个灾民获救后，一看他们的手，十个手指的指甲全都翻开了，没有一个好的。故事2：大声呼叫，9人逃出49岁的奂义民，是舟曲城关镇皇庙山人，做饮料批发生意。8月7日深夜，他正在家里睡觉，突然听到房屋背后的山上，有流水的声音，他下意识判断可能是泥石流。奂义民说，这次泥石流的声音比以前都要大，他当即叫醒还在熟睡中的妻子和两个儿子。奂义民跑到自己3楼上，朝楼下的居民大声叫喊：“快起来啊，快往山上跑。”奂义民厮声力竭地叫喊了十多声，并且声音越喊越大，但楼下回应的居民不多，奂义民的嗓子都喊哑了。几分钟后，有9名居民从山下往上跑，来到奂义民的家中呆着，最后幸免于难。奂义民回忆说，泥石流越来越大，山上的大石头也不断往下翻滚，砸到山下的房屋后，阵阵房屋倒塌声传来，还有玻璃破碎的声响。不到半个小时，他家楼下的几户人家，已全部被泥石流冲走，房屋已不复存在。“我从来没有遇到过……太可怕了”，回想起当时的情形，奂义民依旧无法平静。在这次灾害中，奂义民经营的两个经营门面被淹没，他说，损失达百万余元。但想到一家人能够存活下来，奂义民已觉得这是万幸。两个儿子现都在做志愿者，义务帮县城受灾居民搬运物品。另外让奂义民庆幸的是，他的父母居住在县城大坝附近一栋3层楼内，事发时都被救出。羊城晚报记者许琛	王明昌,王爱强,王彩强,奂义民,许琛	正向	"Story 1: Homemade raft, rescue people from the river This is a story that has been passed down among the disaster victims: A tricycle driver rescued 74 people by making a homemade raft. Wang Ming昌, a tricycle driver in Nanqiao Village, Jiangpan Township, relies on operating a tricycle for a living. On the evening of August 7, Wang Ming昌 did not sleep in the house because he had a gathering with friends, and therefore escaped the disaster. When he returned home, the two-story small house had been flattened by a mudslide, and there was a wail all around. Wang Mingchang saw that many houses had been washed away by the mudslide into the river, and some of the disaster victims were calling for help from high places on the ruins. Wang Mingchang recalled his living tricycle, took off the three wheels, and made a simple raft with wooden boards. The Qingfeng Hotel in Zhouqu was washed down the Bai Long River by the mudslide, and many passengers stuck their heads out of the windows, shouting for help continuously. Wang Mingchang held the small boat and rushed down the river. Facing the surging river water, it was not clear whether it was familiar with driving this job or whether the determination to save people overcame fear. Wang Mingchang soon mastered the secrets of the small raft. The small raft could only save one or two people at a time, and Wang Mingchang went back and forth to save people, rescuing a total of 74 people. Wang Aiqiang and Wang Caiqiang are neighbors of Wang Mingchang. After the disaster, they did not care about the property at home and rescued people as soon as possible. Three disaster victims were trapped on the edge of the landslide dam, clinging to the rocks on the edge of the cliff to avoid falling into the river, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Wang Aiqiang’s brothers borrowed ropes from house to house, and then connected the ropes together to a length of 50 meters. Wang Aiqiang's brother held a rope and came to the edge of the dam lake, put the rope around the disaster victims, and then slowly put them on Wang Mingchang's small rubber raft. After these three disaster victims were rescued, they looked at their hands and found that all ten fingernails were flipped and there was not a single good one. Story 2: Shout loudly, 9 people escaped. Huan Yiming, 49 years old, is from Huayang Mountain in Huancheng Town, Zouchu City, and does wholesale beverage business. On the night of August 7, he was sleeping at home when he suddenly heard the sound of running water behind the house, and he subconsciously judged that it might be a mudslide. Han Yiming said that the sound of the mudslide was louder than before, and he immediately woke up his wife and two sons who were still sleeping. Han Yiming ran to the 3rd floor of his building and shouted loudly to the residents downstairs, ""Wake up, run to the mountain quickly."" Huan Yiming screamed for more than ten times with all his strength, and his voice grew louder and louder, but few residents downstairs responded. Huan Yiming's voice was hoarse. A few minutes later, nine residents ran up the mountain and stayed at Huan Yiming's home, and in the end, they were saved. Han Yiming recalled that the mudslide was getting bigger and bigger, and the big stones on the mountain were rolling down continuously. After they hit the houses on the lower part of the mountain, the sound of houses collapsing and the sound of glass breaking could be heard. In less than half an hour, the houses of several families below his building were all washed away by the mud and water flow, and the houses no longer existed. ""I have never encountered... too terrible,"" Huan Yiming could not calm down when he recalled the situation at that time. In this disaster, Huan Yiming’s two business outlets were flooded, and he said that the loss was over one million yuan. But thinking of the whole family surviving, Huan Yiming already felt that it was a stroke of luck. Both of their sons are now volunteers, helping the residents in the county town move goods free of charge. Fortunately, Huan Yiming’s parents were rescued when the incident occurred, as they lived in a three-story building near the dam in the county town. Xu Chen, a reporter from the羊城晚报"

网宿科技高成长性成疑：业务门槛低大客户集中挂着高科技的牌子，但其实质更像是服务提供商，网宿科技(300017)上市前高管声称未来三年复合增长50%的目标，已经难以受到市场认同。上市后业绩大变脸上市前的2009年前三季度，网宿科技实现净利润3486万元，同比增长39.38%。但是2009年全年，网宿科技净利润为3885.14万元，同比仅增长4.78%，但扣除非经常性损益后网宿科技的净利润同比下降4.79%。也就是说，公司2009年四季度业绩大幅下降。2010年一季度业绩下滑更猛，网宿科技一季度业绩显示净利润为503.8万元，同比大幅下降61.13%，营业收入也同比减少5.54%。对此，网宿科技的解释是由于国家对互联网展开整顿，抑制了一部分IDC和CDN业务的需求。然而，这一解释并不能完全被市场接受，因为在营业收入下降的情况下，网宿科技的各项成本却大幅增长，其中销售费用同比增长90.74%；管理费用同比增长44.73%。同时，公司还出现一上市后总经理就辞职的情况。业务门槛低除成本因素外，造成网宿科技业绩不佳的根本原因是公司业务。网宿科技的主营业务为两块，一块是IDC业务，一块为CDN业务。所谓IDC业务，其实就是网络服务器租用和托管以及相关的其他业务。CDN业务即为内容分发网络业务，通过在现有的Internet中增加一层新的网络架构，使用户获取离用户最近的服务器，提高网络连接速度。“IDC业务几乎不具备技术含量，仅仅是提供网络设备空间的一个服务。这一业务目前有很多家公司涉足，尽管网宿科技声称自身为IDC业务的领头羊，但是其市场份额很小，仅有几个百分点。”信达证券IT业务分析师边铁城表示，“CDN业务具备一定的技术含量，未来的需求会越来越多。”然而，即使是CDN业务也缺乏门槛。国外CDN业务已经开展多年，国内的CDN业务不具备任何技术优势，仅需要一定的设备投入即可加入。缺乏独特客户资源对网宿科技涉及的业务而言，其销售和渠道恐怕更为重要。但是目前看来，网宿科技在这一方面也缺乏优势。在招股说明书中，网宿科技表示在网络游戏与流媒体行业，市场上较为知名的公司均与网宿科技签订有长期服务合同，客户包括腾讯、搜狐、久游网等等。然而，为这些客户提供CDN、IDC服务的还有很多业务商，客户不具备任何排他性。尤其是部分原CDN业务的客户已经开始自行开展CDN业务，比如优酷网、土豆网等。公司的另一个隐患是，网宿科技的大客户过于集中，有25%以上的业务收入来自腾讯。“如果腾讯CDN也自己做了呢？网宿科技还有业绩吗？”一位股民在股吧上这样质疑。成长性难撑股价行业竞争激烈又缺乏独特客户资源，这就意味着网宿科技缺乏足够的议价能力。这一问题已经从公司不断下降的毛利率反映出来，2010年一季度公司综合毛利率从去年同期的37.75%下降至本期的34.93%。“从目前的情况来看，网宿科技希望保持营业收入年复合增长30%是可能的，但保持净利润年30%的增长率是较为困难的，而30%的成长性是一家小公司最基本的要求。”一位券商IT行业分析师指出，“IT行业的市盈率在30倍到40倍之间，网宿科技的股价远远超出合理估值。”对应2009年市盈率，网宿科技的市盈率为52倍。因此，很多券商在撰写的报告中也不看好公司未来的股价上涨，对公司给予“中性评级”。商报记者陈洁	边铁城,陈洁	负向	Netseer's high growth is questionable: low business barriers, concentrated large customers, and a high-tech label, but in fact, it is more like a service provider. Netseer's executives claimed a compound growth target of 50% in the next three years before the listing, which is no longer recognized by the market. Post-IPO performance took a turn for the worse. In the first three quarters of 2009, Wansu Technology achieved a net profit of 34.86 million yuan, up 39.38% year-on-year. But in 2009, NetEase's net profit was only 38.8514 million yuan, with a year-on-year increase of only 4.78%, but after deducting non-recurring gains and losses, NetEase's net profit decreased by 4.79% year-on-year. That is, the company's performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 dropped sharply. Performance in the first quarter of 2010 declined more sharply, and the net profit of NetEase Technology in the first quarter showed a decrease of 61.13% year-on-year, and the revenue also decreased by 5.54% year-on-year. For this, NetEase's explanation is that the整顿of the Internet by the state has suppressed the demand for a portion of IDC and CDN businesses. However, this explanation was not entirely accepted by the market, as the costs of NetEase Technology increased significantly in the face of declining operating income, with sales expenses growing by 90.74% year-on-year and management expenses growing by 44.73% year-on-year. Moreover, the general manager resigned immediately after the company went public. Low business threshold, apart from cost factors, the fundamental reason for NetEase's poor performance is the company's business. Netseer's main business consists of two parts: one is IDC business, and the other is CDN business. So-called IDC business is actually the leasing and hosting of network servers and related other businesses. CDN is a content delivery network business, which adds a new network architecture to the existing Internet to make users get the server closest to them, thereby improving network connection speed. IDC business is almost devoid of technology, merely providing a service for network equipment space. Many companies are currently involved in this business. Although NetEase claims to be the leader in IDC business, its market share is very small, only a few percentage points. “Xinda Securities IT business analyst Tiance Ben said, “CDN business has a certain level of technology, and the demand in the future will be more and more.” However, even CDN business lacks a barrier to entry. Foreign CDN business has been carried out for many years, and domestic CDN business has no technical advantage and only needs a certain amount of equipment investment to join. The lack of unique customer resources is more important for NetEase's sales and channels involved in its business. But at present, NS focuses on this aspect also lacks an advantage. In the prospectus, NetEase Science and Technology stated that well-known companies in the online game and streaming media industry had signed long-term service contracts with NetEase Science and Technology, including customers such as Tencent, Sohu, and Jouyou Network. However, there are many business providers that offer CDN and IDC services to these customers, and the customers do not have any exclusivity. Part of the original CDN business customers have already started to operate their own CDN business, such as Youku and Tudou. Another hidden danger of the company is that Zhenzhu Technology's major customers are too concentrated, with more than 25% of business income coming from Tencent. What if Tencent CDN also did it themselves? Does NetEase still have performance? A stock investor questioned this on the stock forum. Growth potential is hard to support stock price, and the industry is highly competitive and lacks unique customer resources, which means that NetEase lacks sufficient bargaining power. This problem has been reflected in the company's continuously declining gross margin, which dropped from 37.75% in the same period last year to 34.93% in the first quarter of 2010. Given the current situation, it is possible for NSIT to maintain a 30% compound annual growth rate in revenue, but it is more difficult to maintain a 30% growth rate in net profit, and a 30% growth rate is the most basic requirement for a small company. An analyst in the IT industry of a securities firm pointed out that the P/E ratio of the IT industry is between 30 and 40 times, and the stock price of Wansu Technology far exceeds the reasonable valuation. The P/E ratio of NetEase Science and Technology corresponds to 52 times the earnings of 2009. Thus, many brokers also have a neutral rating for the company in their reports, not expecting the stock price to rise in the future. Business reporter Chen Jie

Sina Finance News, April 8th, in the second quarter, new stocks will come one after another. Market sources said that the Hongkong Land, spun off from Swire (0019), will have its initial public offering hearing next Thursday (15). According to Hong Kong media reports, with the second quarter, new stocks will continue to come. Market rumors suggest that Swire Properties, spun off from Swire (0019), will have its initial public offering hearing next Thursday (15th), with an estimated fundraising of about HK$30 billion, with Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley as the sponsors. In addition, the RSL Lighting, which is rumored to have raised about HK$1.56 billion, plans to officially introduce itself on the 26th of this month and start public offering on May 6, and list on the 14th; the Chinese packaging paper manufacturer Youyuan International also plans to list in Hong Kong in the second quarter. In addition, it is said that Sika Group, which was shelved for poor market conditions in February this year, is planning to relaunch in the near future. The French skincare brand L'Occitane began its initial roadshow yesterday, and is scheduled to officially launch on the 19th of this month, and to start the subscription on the 26th.

Agricultural Bank invites 21 investment banks to offer IPO suggestions. According to Bloomberg, Agricultural Bank invited more than 20 banks to bid for the A+H share listing in mainland China and Hong Kong. It was reported that the ADBC invited 21 banks, including 10 banks that are qualified to organize mainland listings, to provide Hong Kong IPO recommendations on April 2, and to compete for the recommendation of mainland listings. The message said that the invitation document did not disclose the time and scale of the Agricultural Bank's IPO. It was reported that the A+H share raising of the Agricultural Bank could reach 200 billion yuan (2.93 billion US dollars). Issuing such a large number of shares on the mainland and in Hong Kong will make Agricultural Bank’s IPO the largest in the world, surpassing Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which raised $22 billion when it went public in 2006.

佳华百货预计2010年盈利本报讯香港上市公司佳华百货控股董事会昨日发布公告称，预计2010年公司业绩将录得盈利。早前有报导指，佳华管理层表示将抓住利好势头，希望5年内能在全国范围内增开50至80间分店，每年销售金额达到50至80亿人民币。佳华百货在2009年为进行业务结构调整，一次性拨备4091.8万元人民币关闭了两家亏损门店，并对其他门店进行全面装修，如撇除有关拨备，公司业绩明显改善，2010年营业额持续上扬。事实上，公司财务状况一直十分良好，2010年上半年资产负债率不到38%，公司可用于营业费用的流动资金更高达2.49亿港币。加之在港上市时筹得的3亿港币，目前只用了1.3亿。由此可见，佳华目前的有充足的资金全力发展、扩大业务。近期佳华股价一路上扬，日前更冲上1.03高位。相比09年同期业绩亏损报告，今年业绩录得盈利相信令投资者们信心大增，未来发展空间进一步扩大。(谢诚)欢迎发表评论我要评论	谢诚	正向	Jiahua Department Store is expected to make a profit in 2010. A report in the media said that Jiahua Department Store Holdings, a listed company in Hong Kong, announced yesterday that it expects its performance in 2010 to be profitable. Earlier reports indicated that Jiahua management said it would seize the favorable momentum and hoped to open 50 to 80 new stores nationwide in five years, with annual sales of 5 to 8 billion RMB. Jiahua Department Store set aside 40.918 million RMB in 2009 to close two loss-making stores and renovate other stores in order to adjust its business structure. If we exclude the provisions, the company’s performance was significantly improved, and the turnover continued to rise in 2010. In fact, the company's financial situation has always been very good, with a debt-to-asset ratio of less than 38% in the first half of 2010, and the company's working capital available for operating expenses reached HK$249 million. In addition to the 300 million Hong Kong dollars raised when listed on the Hong Kong stock market, only 130 million has been used so far. Thus, Jiahua currently has sufficient funds to fully develop and expand its business. Recently, Jiahua's stock price has been rising, and it reached a high of 1.03 recently. It is expected that the profit this year will greatly boost investors' confidence, compared with the loss report of the same period in 2009, and the future development space will be further expanded.

Gu Yin and Liu Xuehua are good friends who have been cooperating in the TV series of Qiongyao, ""Deep Courtyard"", ""Several Times of Sunset Red"", and ""Misty Rain"". In 1990, when Liu Xuehua was shooting Xueke in Chengde, Liu Dekai followed her to Chengde, and it was rumored that the two Liu got married locally. Gu Yin confirmed that the wedding ceremony was indeed held in the form of a banquet, which was a banquet that Liu Dekai invited to comfort Liu Xuehua. After the two returned to Taiwan, Liu Xuehua asked Liu Dekai when they would register their marriage? Liu Dekai used the delaying tactic, which made her very sad. Divorce lies, Gu Yin, who was mistaken for a third party, is a good friend of Liu Dekai's ex-wife Wang Jingping. She said that everyone thought that Liu Dekai and Wang Jingping had divorced, but in fact they had not. He told Liu Xuehua that he was divorced, and Liu Xuehua, who was in the dark, did not know that she had been a third wheel for years. Later, he obtained a green card as a US citizen through Wang Jingping, and married his French girlfriend, Angélique, in a hurry after the divorce. Gu Yin said that at that time she and Zhao Yongxin, Li Lifen and other good friends were at Liu Xuehua's home, and they cried together. Denying the rumor of financial support, Liu Dekai has not only once tried to get close to Liu Xuehua, who is determined to break up, but Liu Dekai is unwilling to let go. Gu Yin said that at that time, Xue Hua was very red, and Liu Dekai had always wanted to be a producer and director, and start his own business. Xue Hua had continuously funded him for nearly NT$30 million. Money plus emotion, it's hard to separate. In the end, the two finally broke up and ended their 6-year long relationship. Did Liu Dekai ever return the money, she never heard Xue Hua mention it. Regarding his marriage, which has been over 10 years ago, Liu Dakai, who is currently shooting in Yunnan, responded, ""I don't want to talk about it anymore."" My company is not a sole proprietorship, I am not short of money, and there is no borrowing or financial assistance. He sighed, ""Everyone is very sad about the accident that happened to her, so let's not talk about it anymore."" """
西蒙开关拥有近百项专利12道品质保证SIMON西蒙电气自1999年来到中国，经历了近10年的风雨历程，最终凭借其稳健务实、团结创新的企业作风，在中国低压电气树立核心品牌地位，在九百六十万平方公里的土地上不断地续写着辉煌。可是谁又能想到一个小小的开关竟拥有近百项专利，而且还应用了如此之多的高科技创新技术，带着对这个的好奇心，记者来到了SIMON西蒙电气设立在江苏海安亚洲生产基地，采访了西蒙电气(中国)有限公司副总经理兼制造总监——黄海军先生，让我们对SIMON西蒙电气精湛的工艺、严谨的工作流程、不断创新的生产技术有了更新的认知。记者：黄总，您好！听说咱们西蒙电气自1916年在西班牙成立以来，经过九十多年的发展，在全球范围内完成了十几次的大规模成功收购，那能否告诉我们西蒙电气在世界各个国家的工厂布局情况是怎样的呢？黄总监：呵呵呵，我们西蒙电气在经过了近百年的发展，除了在西班牙本土拥有十几家工厂之外，在中国、印度、俄罗斯、法国、意大利，包括阿根廷、巴西、墨西哥灯十几个国家一共设立了二十几家公司，其中有12家是海外生产基地，目前中国是最大的海外生产基地和研发中心。产品涵盖了低压、电气附件、智能楼宇、照明电器、综合布线等十几个领域，销售网络也遍布了四大洲、五十多个国家和地区。记者：自1999年西蒙电气进入中国以来，听说西班牙总部在人力和物力方面都投入很大的精力用以打造世界标准的大型实验室和一流的科研队伍，是否可以阐述一下今天中国研发中心的前景和目标？黄总监：西蒙电气中国研发中心成立于2003年，到目前为止已经有了一定规模。中国研发中心的前景和目标主要体现在以下几个方面：第一个是实现全球化。去年，西蒙电气董事会在中国做了一些研究，认为无论从人才、产品与技术的发展来看，中国市场都比较强。确定了中国为西蒙电气的全球化提供研发方面的服务。第二个是使产品走向节能环保，和智能化的完整解决方案方向发展，为客户和用户提供一个整体化的解决方案，包括低压电器、综合布线、开关、灯具照明等。第三是我的个人期望，希望通过一段时间的努力，能够申请成为江苏省省级的研发中心，符合中国政策的前提下创建一个高水平的省级研发中心。记者：对于开关插座而言，一般大众消费者可能认为没有什么技术含量，不知您有什么建议？能否和我们简单的谈一谈西蒙在开关方面的一些技术创新吗？黄总监：当然可以啊！对大多消费者来说，可能真的认为开关插座没有什么高科技含金量。可是如果从专业制造角度来看的话，其实里面隐藏了很多不为人知的在秘密啊。比如：我们西蒙开关独特的无滑动翘板结构、儿童锁，以及高性能载流件等专利技术的应用能确保我们的开关插座较同类产品更加安全可靠。例如无滑动翘板的设计，能有效减灭电弧的产生，平常用户可能感觉不到明显差异，但在潮湿的环境下，例如厨房、卫生间，这种优势一下就体现出来了。我们西蒙产品，不仅在研发方面获得了近百项专利，同时在生产方面更有12道品质保证。我们的开关拨动次数在40000次以上、插座插拔次数达15000次以上，可正常使用12年，并通过了CCC认证，完全符合中国电器附件标准的。记者：由于目前市场上开关插座产品鱼龙混杂，您能否从专业角度教一下我们大众消费者应该如何正确选择开关插座呢？黄总监：乐意之至！首先要认真、仔细的看，看它的外观有没有光泽、褪不褪色、做工够不够精致；这还没完，还要看它的用料是不是通体PC料，因为这款用料具有强度高、阻燃性好等众多优点；其次是手感，一般用料好的开关，如使用优质的PC料和较好的内部铜件材料，开关插座的手感则较重；当你用手拨动时能感受到它的力度，轻巧不紧固、弹簧硬；而差的开关，它的弹簧较软、容易卡在中间，面板用手按起来有薄脆的感觉；最后是听，听它的声音节奏感是否强且轻脆。一般质量好的开关，声音比较明亮，相反，质量差的开关相对比较暗哑，拨动时声音不纯，中间会有间歇状态。记者：刚刚听您谈了好差开关的区别，好像最关键的原材料的使用选择，那对西蒙开关插座来说，我们对原料标准标准是如何制定的呢？黄总监：在产品原料的选择上我们秉承一贯的严谨作风。第一要求性能安全可靠，第二要求节能环保。现在最主要的两大材料，其一是塑料；其二是铜带。对原料供应商一方面要求安全可靠，更多的是对环境的责任和社会的责任。西蒙在对客户提供质量保证的同时也考虑到了对环境、社会的责任。记者：大家都说“先进的工艺、科学的流程才是质量的前提”。西蒙开关照明产品在工艺设计流程的管理和实施方面是如何保证质量的？黄总监：我们对产品工艺有这样几方面要求：一、规范的工艺流程；二、高效的生产方式；三、生产过程的稳定；四、可持续发展，不断持续改进。西蒙产品工艺的设计有一套严格的规范流程，这是西蒙生产体系的要求。为生产的流程、设备的配套、质量的过程控制等各个方面提供了整体的、系统的考虑。记者：我们也知道西蒙电气现在已拥有世界先进水平的专业设备，在行业里面走在最前端。除了引进国外设备外还自主研发出适用于西蒙开关插座生产的自动化装配线。能否对目前拥有的先进设备做一个简要的介绍？黄总监：主要生产线设备有如注塑机，主要是引进进口设备，配套自动化工具。除此外还有自己研发的设备，从2003年开始成立了一个部门专门研究自动化的生产设备。在开关插座的自动化生产方面，率先开发出一些大型自动化生产线，自动化改造的步伐一直在加速推进中。目前，西蒙电气独创自动装配线基本实现了全部塑料件、金属零件的自动上料、保护门组件安装、多轴锁螺丝、上下壳体的合拢等工序。这些自主研发自动化的生产设备有几个优点：第一、针对性，更能符合产品的生产特点。第二、紧迫性。现在强调柔性生产，西蒙开关品种约有4000个，引进不同的设备成本很高，自主研发也能更好解决这一问题。第三、可持续性。自主研究的设备可以应不同要求不断做出改进。在电子产品生产方面也有一些高性能自动化设备。西蒙对技术方面的投入在行业中来说都有很大的参考价值。记者：我们发现业内电子产品保质期为一年，但西蒙的电子产品保质期为两年，西蒙在质量控制上是否有远高于国家和行业检测标准的内控要求？黄总监：是的。业内的电子产品、家用电器的保质期一般为一年，一年之后修理需要付一定的成本，而西蒙可以保证两年之内给予无条件的维护。基于几个方面：一是系统的质量策划，包括产品设计及制造、采购的全部过程，通过质量策划，明确产品整个实现过程中的质量控制要点、方法及具体要求和控制计划；二是有一个高标准的实验室，拥有各种先进的检测设备，着重于对产品的质量分析、常规测试和监督检测，同时与相关国家行业检测机构保持良好沟通合作，以参与对相关行业技术标准的学习分析和修订，以确保SIMON电气产品在行业技术的领先性；三是整个生产过程的控制非常严格，各个环节的质量控制都严格管理。对重要的电子类产品，我们还记录保留每个产品出厂时的各项性能参数信息，以保证可追溯性，出现问题时可以及时准确的找到原因。记者：您也知道，现在LED灯已经成为开关照明行业的热点话题，相信西蒙电气在LED灯方面也会有大动作，不知黄总能否给我们透露一下西蒙在LED灯方面的情况？黄总监：西蒙电气(中国)对LED灯的研究已经开始了一两年，近期才开始推出产品。顺应国际化的潮流，去年建立了LED灯工厂，把LED灯作为了一个重要的研究方向。去年至今年期间，已经陆续研制出初期的产品，还未批量化的上市，从刚刚举行的年度经销商大会可以看出，常规传统的灯具如筒灯、吸顶灯、平板灯都推出了一些LED的产品，但西蒙在LED方面更多的体现在技术应用而不是技术研发上，公司将来会通过扩大研发团队来将LED研发作为一个主攻方向，推出更多的产品。	西蒙,黄海军,黄总,黄总监	正向	"Simon switch has nearly a hundred patents and 12 quality assurance procedures. SIMON Simon Electric has been in China since 1999, and has experienced nearly 10 years of stormy journey. Finally, relying on its solid and practical, united and innovative corporate style, it has established a core brand position in China's low-voltage electrical industry, and continues to write brilliance on the vast land of 9.6 million square kilometers. But who could have thought that a small switch would have nearly a hundred patents and so many high-tech innovations. With a sense of curiosity, the reporter came to the Asian production base of SIMON Siemens Electrical in Hai'an, Jiangsu, to interview Mr. Huang Haijun, the deputy general manager and manufacturing director of Siemens Electrical (China) Co., Ltd., which gave us a deeper understanding of SIMON Siemens Electrical's exquisite craftsmanship, rigorous work process, and innovative production technology. Reporter: Mr. Huang, hello! Have you heard that since Simon Electric was founded in Spain in 1916, it has completed more than ten large-scale successful acquisitions around the world after more than ninety years of development. Can you tell us how Simon Electric's factory layout is in various countries around the world? Mr. Huang: Hahaha, after nearly a century of development, Simon Electric has established more than 20 companies in more than ten countries, including Spain, China, India, Russia, France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and so on. Among them, 12 are overseas production bases. Currently, China is the largest overseas production base and R&D center. The products cover more than a dozen fields, including low-voltage, electrical accessories, smart buildings, lighting appliances, and comprehensive cabling, and the sales network is also distributed in more than 50 countries and regions across four continents. The reporter: Since Simon Electric entered China in 1999, it is said that the Spanish headquarters has invested a lot of manpower and material resources to build a world-class large laboratory and first-class research and development team. Can you elaborate on the prospects and goals of today's China R&D center? Mr. Huang: The XiShen Electrical China R&D Center was established in 2003 and has grown to a certain scale so far. The prospects and goals of the R&D center in China mainly manifest in the following aspects: the first is to achieve globalization. Last year, Simon Electric's board of directors did some research in China and believed that the Chinese market was stronger in terms of talent, product, and technology development. China was determined to provide R&D services for Siemens' globalization. The second is to develop a complete solution towards energy conservation and environmental protection, and intelligence, providing a comprehensive solution for customers and users, including low-voltage electrical appliances, integrated cabling, switches, lighting fixtures, etc. Third is my personal expectation, hoping to apply to become a provincial research center of Jiangsu Province after a period of effort, and create a high-level provincial research center under the premise of complying with Chinese policies. The reporter: For switches and sockets, ordinary consumers may think that there is no technology content. Do you have any suggestions? Could you talk to us about some of the technological innovations Simon has made in the field of switches? Mr. Huang: Of course! For most consumers, it may really think that the switch socket has no high-tech content. But if we look at it from the perspective of professional manufacturing, there are actually many secrets that are unknown to people hidden in it. For example, the application of our Simon switch's unique patent technologies, such as the sliding-free rocker structure, child lock, and high-performance current-carrying components, can ensure that our switches and sockets are safer and more reliable than similar products. For example, the design without sliding rocker can effectively reduce the generation of arcs. Ordinary users may not feel the obvious difference, but in a humid environment, such as the kitchen and bathroom, the advantage is immediately apparent. Our Simon products not only have nearly a hundred patents in R&D, but also have 12 quality assurance processes in production. Our switch has been flicked more than 40,000 times, and the socket has been plugged and unplugged more than 15,000 times, and it can be used normally for 12 years and has passed CCC certification, fully complying with the Chinese electrical accessory standards. Journalist: With so many kinds of switches and sockets on the market, can you give us some professional advice on how to choose the right switches and sockets? Mr. Huang: With pleasure! First, you need to look carefully and see if it has a luster, whether it fades, and whether the craftsmanship is exquisite; This is not over, you also need to see if the material is all PC material, because this material has many advantages such as high strength and good flame retardancy; Secondly, it is the feel, generally, the switches with good materials, such as using high-quality PC materials and better internal copper parts, the feel of the switch socket is heavier; When you use your hand to move it, you can feel its strength, light and not tight, spring hard; and the poor switches, its spring is soft, easy to get stuck in the middle, the panel feels thin and brittle when pressed with your hand; Finally, listen to its sound, whether the rhythm is strong and crisp. Generally, a good switch has a brighter sound, while a poor switch is relatively dull, and the sound is not pure when it is turned, with an intermittent state in the middle. The reporter: Just now, you talked about the difference between the good and bad switch, it seems that the key raw material selection is the most important for the Simon switch socket. How do we formulate the raw material standards for Simon switch sockets? Mr. Huang: In the selection of product raw materials, we adhere to our rigorous style. The first requirement is for performance to be safe and reliable, and the second is for energy conservation and environmental protection. Now the two main materials are plastic and copper tape. On the one hand, we require our raw material suppliers to be safe and reliable, and on the other hand, we are responsible for the environment and society. Simon takes into account the responsibility to the environment and society while providing quality assurance to customers. Journalist: Everyone says that ""advanced technology and scientific process are the prerequisites for quality."" How does Simon ensure the quality in the management and implementation of the process design flow for its lighting products? Mr. Huang: We have the following requirements for the product process: one, standardized process flow; two, efficient production methods; three, stable production process; four, sustainable development, continuous improvement. Simon's product process design has a strict standard process, which is the requirement of Simon's production system. It provides a comprehensive and systematic consideration for all aspects of production processes, equipment matching, and quality process control. The reporter said that Simon Electric now has world-class professional equipment and is at the forefront of the industry. In addition to introducing foreign equipment, we have also independently developed automated assembly lines suitable for the production of Simon switches and sockets. Can you give a brief introduction to the advanced equipment we currently have? Mr. Huang: The main production line equipment includes injection molding machines, which mainly introduce imported equipment and are equipped with automated tools. In addition, there are self-developed equipment, and a department was established in 2003 to research automated production equipment. In the automation production of switch sockets, some large-scale automated production lines were developed first, and the pace of automation transformation has been constantly accelerating. Currently, Siemens Electrical has pioneered an automatic assembly line that has basically achieved automatic feeding of all plastic parts and metal components, installation of protective door components, multi-axis screw tightening, and the assembly of upper and lower shells. These self-developed and automated production equipment have several advantages: first, they are more targeted and better suited to the production characteristics of the product. Second, urgency. Now emphasizing flexible production, Simon switch varieties are about 4000, and the cost of introducing different equipment is very high, and independent research and development can also better solve this problem. Third, sustainability. Devices developed through independent research can be continuously improved to meet different requirements. There are also high-performance automated equipment in the production of electronic products. Simon's investment in technology has great reference value in the industry. The reporter asked: We found that the shelf life of electronic products in the industry is one year, but Simon's electronic products have a shelf life of two years. Does Simon have internal control requirements that are significantly higher than national and industry inspection standards in terms of quality control? Mr. Huang: Yes. The warranty period for electronic products and household appliances in the industry is generally one year, and repairs after one year will incur certain costs. Simon can guarantee unconditional maintenance for two years. Based on several aspects: first, the quality planning of the system, including the entire process of product design and manufacturing, procurement, through quality planning, clarify the quality control key points, methods, specific requirements and control plan of the whole process of product realization; second, there is a high-standard laboratory, equipped with various advanced testing equipment, focusing on the quality analysis, routine testing and supervision of the product, at the same time, maintain good communication and cooperation with relevant national industry testing institutions, to participate in the study, analysis and revision of relevant industry technical standards, to ensure the leading position of SIMON electrical products in the industry technology; third, the control of the entire production process is very strict, and the quality control of each link is strictly managed. For important electronic products, we also record and retain all performance parameters at the time of each product's factory release to ensure traceability. In case of problems, we can find the cause in a timely and accurate manner. The reporter: As you know, LED lamps have become a hot topic in the switch lighting industry, and I believe Simon Electric will also have big moves in LED lamps. Don't know if Mr. Huang can tell us about Simon's situation in LED lamps? Mr. Huang: The research of LED lights by XiShen Electric (China) has been going on for one or two years, and the products have only been launched recently. In line with the trend of internationalization, we established an LED lamp factory last year and made LED lamps an important research direction. During the period from last year to this year, the initial products have been successively developed, but have not yet been mass-produced and launched. From the annual dealer conference just held, it can be seen that some LED products have been launched for conventional and traditional lamps such as recessed lights, ceiling lights, and flat lights. However, Simon's focus on LED is more on the application of technology rather than research and development. The company will expand its R&D team in the future to make LED R&D a main direction, and launch more products."
两名外籍援助人员在索马里中部遭绑架新华网摩加迪沙10月25日电(报道员瓦尔萨迈)索马里中部地区地方政府官员及当地一家非政府组织援助机构25日说，两名外籍援助人员当天在索中部遭不明身份武装分子绑架。这家机构工作人员对新华社报道员说，这两名来自丹麦一家非政府排雷机构的援助人员当天在索马里中部城镇加尔加尤附近地带被绑架，事发时两人正由加尔加尤镇南部前往当地机场途中。目前被绑人员的性别及国籍尚未确认。但有当地民众称，被绑人员为一男一女。另有一位不愿透露姓名的地方政府官员表示，被绑人员均为丹麦人。截至目前，尚无组织或个人声称对该事件负责。索马里自1991年政府被推翻后长期处于无政府状态。成立于2004年的过渡政府无力有效控制全国，中部及南部很多地区长期被反政府武装控制。2008年及2009年，索中部及南部曾发生多起外国援助人员被绑架事件。	瓦尔萨迈	负向	Two foreign aid workers were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen in central Somalia. Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, October 25 (Reporter Walsamy) - On October 25, local government officials and a local non-governmental organization aid agency in central Somalia said that two foreign aid workers were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen in central Somalia. The staff of the organization told Xinhua reporters that the two aid workers from a Danish non-governmental demining agency were kidnapped near the town of Jajaru in central Somalia on that day, when the two were on their way to the local airport from the southern part of Jajaru town. The gender and nationality of the currently kidnapped individuals have not yet been confirmed. But local residents said that the hostages were a man and a woman. Another local government official, who did not wish to be named, said that all the hostages were Danish. So far, no organization or individual has claimed responsibility for the incident. Somalia has been in a state of anarchy since the government was overthrown in 1991. The transitional government, which was established in 2004, was unable to effectively control the entire country, and many areas in the center and south were long controlled by anti-government armed groups. In 2008 and 2009, several aid workers were kidnapped in the center and south of the country.
国奥最后备战名单出炉申花6人入选成输出大户首席记者沈坤?在先后进行了四期集训，总共观察过41名球员的表现后，一份26人的国奥最后备战大名单已经于日前出炉。在这份名单中，申花队员几乎占了1/4的数目，参加上周为期三天飞行集训的6人全部入选。山东也是国奥球员的输出大户，共有4人榜上有名。在这26人中，有个别球员的入选让人颇感意外。其中包括伤别球场三个月之久，且此前从未参加过国奥集训的留洋球员张呈栋。而鲁能小将王彤也只是在第四期集训中随队参加了两堂训练课，他自己之前对于最终入选大名单完全不抱希望，连被选中参加上周的飞行集训都感到莫名，“这不因为买提他们都不能来嘛，派我做个代表，视察一下！”而效力于比利时色格拉俱乐部的汪洋因为在对韩国友谊赛上表现不佳，自己都怀疑会被剔除出队，最终他的名字还是出现在了这份名单中。在这26人中，有10名左右的球员已经提前锁定了主力，只有个别位置存在着一定变数，而主要的变数就存在于锋线和后腰。在这些“主力队员”中，申花球员几乎占去了半数。其中包括门将王大雷，后卫吴曦，中场宋博轩和曹?定。虽然曹?定只参加过第四期为期三天的集训，但是他在中前场的组织能力已经通过训练和比赛得到了主帅老布的认可。他在和东亚的热身赛上不仅为国奥打入一球，且传出了不少有威胁的好球，老布在赛后对他进行了表扬。而在这场前腰之争中，国安小将张稀哲最终失去了自己的位置，也因此落选最后的大名单。中锋仍然是国奥最薄弱的位置，布帅此次招入6名中锋，不仅带上了刚刚从长期伤病中恢复的张呈栋，连正在禁赛期的李凯也没有被嫌弃，可见这个位置的极度缺人。不过布帅表示，就用现在这批人，对付阿曼已经足够了。等到打完这轮淘汰赛，国奥还将继续大面积撒网，挑选新人。	沈坤,张呈栋,王彤,买提,汪洋,王大雷,吴曦,宋博轩,曹?定,老布,张稀哲,布帅,李凯	正向	"The final preparatory list for the Olympic team has been released. Six players from Shanghai Shenhua have been selected, making them the biggest contributors. Chief reporter Shen Kun, after observing the performance of 41 players in four rounds of training, has compiled a list of 26 players for the final preparatory stage. Almost a quarter of the players on this list are from Shanghai Shenhua, and all six players who participated in the three-day flight training last week have been selected. Shandong is also a major supplier of players for the national Olympic team, with a total of 4 players listed. Among the 26 players, some selections were surprising. It also includes Zhang Chengdong, who has been away from the pitch for three months and has never participated in the national Olympic team training before. And Wang Tong, a young player from Ronglu, only participated in two training sessions during the fourth training camp. He had no hope of being included in the final list before, and even felt strange about being selected for the flight training last week, ""Isn't it because Maiti and the others can't come? They sent me to be a representative to inspect!"" Wang Yang, who plays for Sint-Truiden in Belgium, was suspected of being excluded from the team because of his poor performance in the friendly match against South Korea. In the end, his name was still on the list. Of the 26, about 10 players have already secured their starting positions, with only a few positions having some uncertainty, and the main uncertainty lies in the attack and the defensive midfielder. Among these ""main players"", almost half of them are Shenhua players. It includes goalkeeper Wang Daire, defender Wu Xie, midfielder Song Boxuan and defenders Cao Dìng. Although Cao Ding only participated in the fourth three-day training camp, his midfield and forward organizing ability has been recognized by head coach Lou Bu through training and matches. Not only did he score a goal for the national team in the warm-up match against East Asia, but he also passed on many dangerous passes. In the post-match interview, Lou Bu praised him. In this battle for the position of attacking midfielder, the young player from Guoan, Zhang Xizhe, ultimately lost his position and was also excluded from the final list. The center forward is still the weakest position of the Olympic team. Coach Bu brought in six center forwards this time, not only bringing back Zhang Chengdong who had just recovered from a long-term injury, but also did not reject Li Kai who was still in the suspension period, which shows the extreme shortage of this position. But Coach Bu said that the current batch of players is enough to deal with Oman. After this round of elimination, the Olympic team will continue to cast a wide net to select new players."

摩根大通将苹果第四季营收调高至187亿美元新浪科技讯北京时间10月7日晚间消息，据国外媒体报道，摩根大通分析师马克·莫斯科维茨(MarkMoskowitz)周四将苹果2010财年第四季度营收预期从181.3亿美元提高至187.1亿美元，并继续维持400美元的目标股价。莫斯科维茨预计，在截至9月30日的第四季度，苹果毛利率将达到39.5%，高于此前预期的39.2%，且有望于下个季度达到40%。而2011财年营收总额将达到815.3亿美元，高于此前预期的788.4亿美元，该数据并不包括Verizon版iPhone营收。当前有消息称，苹果最早将于2011年推出Verizon版iPhone。莫斯科维茨称，如果消息属实，那么Verizon版iPhone最多可使苹果每股摊薄收益提高2美元。莫斯科维茨认为，尽管许多厂商推出了自己的平板电脑，但苹果iPad的竞争力仍强于iPhone。摩根大通预计，苹果第四季度iPad销量将达到470万部，高于BernsteinResearch分析师科林·麦克格拉汉姆(ColinMcGranahan)预计的450万部。摩根大通称，平板电脑将在很大程度上蚕食上网本销量，但不会影响苹果Mac计算机销量。相反，莫斯科维茨还称，iPad有助于推动Mac销量。(李明)	马克·莫斯科维茨,莫斯科维茨,科林·麦克格拉汉姆,李明	正向	JPMorgan raised Apple's fourth quarter revenue to $18.7 billion. Sina Tech News, Beijing time, October 7th, in the evening, according to foreign media reports, JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz raised Apple's fourth quarter revenue forecast for the fiscal year 2010 from $18.13 billion to $18.71 billion, and continued to maintain a target share price of $400. Mozgovoy predicted that Apple's gross margin for the fourth quarter ending September 30 would reach 39.5%, up from the previously expected 39.2%, and could reach 40% in the next quarter. And revenue for the fiscal year 2011 will reach $81.53 billion, up from the previously expected $78.84 billion, which does not include the revenue from the Verizon version of the iPhone. There is currently news that the Verizon version of the iPhone will be launched as early as 2011. Mozgovoy said that if the report is true, the Verizon version of the iPhone could boost Apple’s earnings per share by as much as $2. Moskowitz believes that although many manufacturers have launched their own tablets, the competitiveness of the Apple iPad is still stronger than that of the iPhone. JPMorgan expects that Apple's iPad sales in the fourth quarter will reach 4.7 million units, higher than the 4.5 million units expected by ColinMcGranahan, an analyst at Bernstein Research. JPMorgan expects that tablet computers will cannibalize netbook sales to a large extent, but will not affect the sales of Apple Mac computers. On the contrary, Moscovitz also claimed that the iPad helped to boost Mac sales. (Li Ming)
妻子疑丈夫有外遇打车跟踪司机被丈夫当出气筒本报讯记者张祖珍、实习生朱沛东报道：怀疑丈夫有外遇，妻子打的士一路跟踪抓现行。追上之后，妻子对丈夫手撕牙咬，恼火的丈夫将怒气撒在妻子所乘的士的司机身上。昨日，省城洪城路与抚生路交叉口发生打架事件，引来多人围观。“说什么说，不是和你说了，这是我们的家事，你干吗还紧追着不放？”昨日中午，在洪城路与抚生路交叉口附近，一名衣衫不整的男子指着另一名男子激动地大吼，旁边还围着很多路人，两辆出租车停在现场。据路人林先生告诉记者，骂人的男子是一名出租车司机，刚和其妻打了一架。“他老婆好凶，冲上来又是扯衣服又是牙齿咬，男的衬衣被撕烂了，胸口露出一大片，肚子上也被抓花了。”据悉，夫妻俩之所以打架，是因为妻子怀疑丈夫有外遇。两个男人上演“全武行”，是因为丈夫将怒气撒到另一名出租车司机身上，责怪其载着他妻子全城追他。“我真是太冤枉了，那个女的上了我的车后说追前面的出租车。她说要追，我不就跟着追啊！”被当出气筒的出租车司机喊冤。原来，女子在红谷滩上了他的车后，要他追前面一辆出租车。于是，他一路追到南昌大桥，再追到洪城路、抚生路，沿着洪城大市场追了一圈后，最终在洪城路与抚生路交叉口追上了。追上之后，闹剧发生了。但他没想到，自己也被卷入其中，还挨了打，便立即报警。桃花派出所民警赶到现场，将双方带到派出所处理。	张祖珍,朱沛东,林先生	负向	Suspecting her husband of having an affair, the wife hired a taxi to follow the driver and catch him in the act. After catching up, the wife bit and tore at the husband, and the husband vented his anger on the taxi driver who was riding with his wife. Yesterday, a fight broke out at the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road in the provincial city, attracting a large number of people to watch. What are you talking about? I have already told you that this is our family matter, why are you still following it up? Yesterday noon, near the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road, a man in tattered clothes shouted excitedly at another man, surrounded by many passersby, and two taxis were parked at the scene. According to Mr. Lin, a passerby, who told the reporter, the man who was cursing was a taxi driver, who had just had a fight with his wife. His wife was very fierce, rushing up and tearing at his clothes and biting him with her teeth. The man's shirt was torn to shreds, exposing a large area of his chest, and his stomach was also scratched. It is said that the couple fought because the wife suspected that the husband had an affair. Two men put on a “full-contact” fight because the husband vented his anger on another taxi driver, blaming him for taking his wife on a city-wide chase. I was so wronged. The woman said to follow the taxi in front of me after she got into my car. She said she would chase, so I just followed and chased! The taxi driver, who was being vented on, protested his innocence. In fact, the woman asked him to chase the taxi in front of him after she got into his car in Honggutan. So, he chased all the way to Nanchang Bridge, then to Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road. After circling around Hongcheng Market, he finally caught up at the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road. After catching up, the farce began. But he did not expect to be involved in it, and was even beaten, so he immediately called the police. The police officers from Peach Blossom Police Station arrived at the scene and took both parties to the police station for handling.
ESPN最新评奖火箭一人进步最快MVP榜新星超科比新浪体育讯　北京时间3月17日，ESPN专栏作家莫瑞斯-布鲁克斯更新了赛季各奖项的候选人排名，其中在最有价值球员奖的争夺名单中，勒布朗-詹姆斯依旧稳坐榜首，而休斯顿火箭队的阿隆-布鲁克斯有望与昔日队友卡尔-兰德里争夺进步最快球员奖，主教练里克-阿德尔曼则有机会染指年度最佳教练奖。1.勒布朗-詹姆斯(克里夫兰骑士队)2.凯文-杜兰特(俄克拉荷马雷霆队)假如这位年仅21岁的球员能够击败詹姆斯坐上得分榜的宝座，那么他将成为NBA历史上最年轻的得分王。3.科比-布莱恩特(洛杉矶湖人队)领袖才华也是获得最有价值球员奖的关键，事实是，科比在本赛季已经完成了7次绝杀。4.德克-诺维斯基(达拉斯小牛队)当小牛队取得13连胜后，我敢肯定人们绝对不会想到纽约尼克斯队会成为阻止他们连胜的首选球队，诺维斯基在这场比赛中贡献20分和12个篮板，但仍然无法弥补上半场出现的巨大劣势。5.卡梅罗-安东尼(丹佛掘金队)在个人拿下45分和10个篮板但最终输给休斯顿火箭队后，安东尼在本赛季已经有7场比赛得分超过40分。6.德怀特-霍华德(奥兰多魔术队)他的防守就像其他得分机器的进攻一样出色，照主教练斯坦-范甘迪的话说，霍华德可以在防守端影响到对手的每一次进攻。7.德隆-威廉姆斯(犹他爵士队)他本赛季已经取得了35次两双表现，其中包括最近6场比赛中完成了5次，而在本周击败华盛顿奇才队后，爵士队只落后掘金队2场而已。8.史蒂夫-纳什(菲尼克斯太阳队)昔日连续2个赛季获得MVP的纳什如今迎来了自己的第1000场比赛，尽管他的身体已经运行够久了，但他仍然打出了自己职业生涯中最出色的赛季之一。9.德怀恩-韦德(迈阿密热火队)在最近的一波6胜1负的战绩中，韦德场均贡献30.6分、7.9次助攻和5个篮板。10.布兰顿-罗伊(波特兰开拓者队)虽然因伤缺阵了14场比赛令他临时被排挤在10名之外，但他在复出后的表现好坏可能也难以反应在开拓者队的战绩中。进步最快球员奖1.阿隆-布鲁克斯(休斯顿火箭队)不知道火箭队的公关部有没有开始准备策划一些有关支持布鲁克斯当选进步最快球员奖的活动，但他在与掘金队比赛中的表现绝对是一个不错的开始。2.马克-加索尔(孟菲斯灰熊队)提起加索尔，则不得不提到扎克-兰多夫，不确定灰熊队的这两位大将是否愿意共同分享这一荣誉。3.卡尔-兰德里(萨克拉门托国王队)这位三年级球员在各项数据上都刷新了个人职业生涯新高。4.安德鲁-博古特(米尔沃基雄鹿队)这位刚当选东部周最佳球员的年轻中锋在本赛季已经取得了32次两双。5.约什-史密斯(亚特兰大老鹰队)他在上赛季的进步神速，那么有没有可能让一位心智上进步神速的球员当选进步最快球员奖？年度最佳防守球员1.德怀特-霍华德(奥兰多魔术队)我们都知道霍华德的优势是什么，当他在场上时，对手往往会放弃内线进攻。2.罗恩-阿泰斯特(洛杉矶湖人队)批评家称他的年纪有些大了，而且实力有点退步，但他仍旧是联盟中最优秀的外围防守球员。3.吉拉德-华莱士(夏洛特山猫队)当华莱士在场上时，他可能是联盟中最吝啬的防守者。4.安德鲁-博古特(米尔沃基雄鹿队)他是联盟中封盖榜排名第二的球员，也是进步最快球员奖的争夺者。5.约什-史密斯(亚特兰大老鹰队)和安德森-瓦莱乔(克里夫兰骑士队)凯尔特人队已经吃尽了瓦莱乔在防守上给他们带来的苦头。年度最佳教练1.斯考特-布鲁克斯(俄克拉荷马雷霆队)凭借着出色的防守，雷霆队已经取得了5连胜。2.斯科特-斯基尔斯(米尔沃基雄鹿队)他们如今已经比上赛季的总获胜场次多赢了2场。3.内特-麦克米兰(波特兰开拓者队)他的入选或许是因为开拓者队处在联盟中竞争最激烈的分区中。4.拉里-布朗(夏洛特山猫队)他所率领的球队已经取得6连胜，而本赛季在主场赢得了24场胜利也刷新了球会纪录，剩余的赛季中，山猫队只需再赢2场即可刷新单击获胜场次纪录。5.莱昂内尔-霍林斯(孟菲斯灰熊队)和里克-阿德尔曼(休斯顿火箭队)虽然两位教练所带领的球队都不太可能打入季后赛，但这两支赛季前不被看好的球队却取得了超过5成的胜率。(喜欢)	莫瑞斯-布鲁克斯,布鲁克斯,勒布朗-詹姆斯,阿隆-布鲁克斯,卡尔-兰德里,里克-阿德尔曼,阿德尔曼,凯文-杜兰特,科比-布莱恩特,德克-诺维斯基,诺维斯基,卡梅罗-安东尼,德怀特-霍华德,斯坦-范甘迪,德隆-威廉姆斯,史蒂夫-纳什,德怀恩-韦德,布兰顿-罗伊,马克-加索尔,扎克-兰多夫,兰多夫,安德鲁-博古特,约什-史密斯,史密斯,罗恩-阿泰斯特,吉拉德-华莱士,华莱士,安德森-瓦莱乔,瓦莱乔,凯尔特人队,斯考特-布鲁克斯,斯科特-斯基尔斯,内特-麦克米兰,拉里-布朗,莱昂内尔-霍林斯,霍林斯	正向	ESPN's latest award rankings show that the Rockets' Aaron Brooks is a candidate for the most improved player award, which he could win along with his former teammate Carl Landry. The Rockets' coach, Rick Adelman, is also a candidate for the coach of the year award. LeBron James is still at the top of the MVP list. Sina Sports News, March 17, 2010: ESPN columnist Maurice Brooks updated the season award candidates. Among the MVP candidates, LeBron James is still at the top, and Houston Rockets' Aaron Brooks has the chance to compete with his former teammate, Carl Landry, for the most improved player award. Rockets' coach Rick Adelman also has the chance to win the coach of the year award. 1. LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) 2. Kevin Durant (Oklahoma Thunder) If this player, who is only 21 years old, can defeat James and take the top spot in the scoring list, he will become the youngest scoring champion in NBA history. 3. Kobe Bryant (Los Angeles Lakers) is a leader with the ability to win the MVP award, and the fact is that Kobe has already completed 7 game-winning shots in this season. 4. Dirk Nowitzki (Dallas Mavericks) After the Mavericks won 13 consecutive games, I am sure that no one would have thought that the New York Knicks would be the first team to stop their winning streak. Nowitzki contributed 20 points and 12 rebounds in this game, but still could not make up for the huge disadvantage in the first half. 5. Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets) scored 45 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in his personal game, but still lost to the Houston Rockets. Anthony has scored over 40 points in 7 games this season. 6. Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic) His defense is as good as the offensive of other scoring machines, as Stan Van Gundy, the head coach, said that Howard can affect the opponent's every offensive on the defensive end. 7. Deron Williams (Utah Jazz) He has already achieved 35 double-doubles this season, including 5 in his last 6 games. After defeating the Washington Wizards this week, the Jazz are only 2 games behind the Nuggets. 8. Steve Nash (Phoenix Suns) Nash, who won the MVP award for two consecutive seasons in the past, is now playing his 1000th game. Although his body has been running for a long time, he still played one of the best seasons of his career. 9. Dwyane Wade (Miami Heat) contributed 30.6 points, 7.9 assists and 5 rebounds per game in the recent 6-1 run. 10. Brandon Roy (Portland Trail Blazers) was temporarily ranked outside the top 10 because of 14 games missed due to injury, but his performance after returning to the court may not be reflected in the Trail Blazers' record. The Most Improved Player Award 1. Aaron Brooks (Houston Rockets) It is unknown whether the Rockets' PR department has started to plan some activities to support Brooks' selection as the Most Improved Player Award, but his performance against the Nuggets is definitely a good start. 2. Marc Gasol (Memphis Grizzlies) When mentioning Gasol, you can't help mentioning Zach Randolph, it is uncertain whether the two big shots of the Grizzlies are willing to share this honor together. 3. Carl Landry (Sacramento Kings) is a third-year player who has set new career highs in all statistical categories. 4. Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks) The young center, who was just named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, has already achieved 32 double-doubles this season. 5. Josh Smith (Atlanta Hawks) He made great progress last season, so is it possible for a player who made great mental progress to win the award for Most Improved Player? Defensive Player of the Year 1. Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic) We all know what Howard's strengths are. When he is on the court, the opponents often give up the inside attack. 2. Ron Artest (Los Angeles Lakers) was criticized for being a bit old and declining in strength, but he is still the best perimeter defender in the league. 3. Gerald Wallace (Charlotte Hornets) When Wallace is on the court, he may be the most miserly defender in the league. 4. Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks) He is the second highest shot blocker in the league and a contender for the Most Improved Player award. 5. Josh Smith (Atlanta Hawks) and Anderson Varejão (Cleveland Cavaliers). The Celtics have already tasted the bitterness that Varejão brought to their defense. Coach of the Year 1. Scott Brooks (Oklahoma Thunder) The Thunder have won five consecutive games thanks to their excellent defense. 2. Scott Skiles (Milwaukee Bucks) They have now won 2 more games than the total wins of last season. 3. Nate McMillan (Portland Trail Blazers) His selection may be due to the fact that the Trail Blazers are in the most competitive division in the league. 4. Larry Brown (Charlotte Bobcats) His team has won 6 consecutive games, and the Bobcats have won 24 home games this season, breaking the club record. In the remaining season, the Bobcats only need to win 2 more games to break the record for the most wins in a season. 5. Lionel Hollins (Memphis Grizzlies) and Rick Adelman (Houston Rockets), although the two coaches' teams are unlikely to make the playoffs, the two teams that were not expected to do well at the beginning of the season have won more than 50% of their games.

福建武夷山到广州南沙走进三省三大球场南游记对于我等好抽绿色鸦片的人，云游中国寻访高尔夫球场已经成为戒不掉的瘾。就像女人往往成群结队扎堆购物一样，打球的人也自有自己的小圈子。我和A君、老赵因为打球而结缘，也习惯性地在每年天气还不错时相约出游。夫子则是一块在网上侃球的球友，神交已久，一直未曾谋面。聊起四五月份这个晚春时节，正是去南方打高尔夫的绝佳时机。与诸君聊起此事，遂一拍即合。去南方打？到哪里打好呢？云南、广东、海南…处处都是不能割舍之地。几人一合计，干脆从东南到西南(后因某些原因未至西南)，来个四人版南游记。打球为主，赏景为辅，诚不快哉！于是定路线寻球场，用时6天，从起始点福建武夷山到终点广州南沙，走进三省三大球场，着着实实过了一次打球的瘾，也过了一回闲云野鹤般的逍遥生活。正是：东游以求仙，西游以礼佛，北游以齐物，南游以击球。第一站：武夷山风景处处皆风景第一个要去的球场就是武夷山风景高尔夫。这个球场，夫子去过，直夸不错。我只是多年前慕名去福地武夷旅游过，还没在那打过球。让我们感兴趣的是武夷山最近推出的商务击球超值礼包。住两晚、打两场球、送自助早餐等，一个人才一千多块。于是赶忙预订。4月25日晴初会午后，我和A君、老赵从所在城市起飞，云层很厚，看起来马上就要下雨了。约两小时抵达武夷山机场，天气大好，碧空如洗，山峦如聚。一下飞机就看到武夷山风景的工作人员拿着接机牌在出口候着，比较窝心。夫子的飞机晚点，我们等了他将近半小时。他有着北方汉子的爽朗，魁伟健壮，铁定是个大炮手。不过夫子就是夫子，一上车，就跟我分析起今年的球员锦标赛的阵容和形势来。说说笑笑间，我们来到武夷山风景高尔夫会所。大家都知道高尔夫人的怪癖。要打好一场球，先得选个舒服的场子。舒服的球场，最重要的当属会所入不入眼。武夷山风景据说有着五星级度假酒店配套会。站在会所举目四望，自己置身于群山的环抱中，白云近得几乎可以用手触摸到。会所与周围的自然美景比起来，是谦卑的。风格融合了闽北传统建筑和现代建筑风格，虽朴拙但并不平淡，“低调的华丽”。晚上，我们吃过中餐厅的农家特色菜，几个人坐在露台边品茶，边聊天，屋外树影扶疏，间或听到鸟鸣声，想着古人的“山中七日，人间千年”，心有戚戚。按照相对论的原理，在这样的地方生活一千年，估计都嫌时间短呢。4月26日晴论球第二天，我们起了个大早。吃过酒店提供的免费自助早餐，来到球场。由于福建本身球场不多，前来打球的人不少。订了早上8点的Tee-Time。我每次下场前有一个怪病：看到新鲜的球场会先在脑海里演练打球场景。这也许是我打球最需要提升的地方，不够从容淡定。来到发球台，照例来个开球前合影。环顾四周，这个场子风光脱俗，近景妩媚，远景辽阔。球童小丽告诉我们，武夷山风景是一个典型的山地球场。整个球场占地2480亩。但若细细观赏，你会发现山外有山。球场的外层就是武夷山最有名的自然景致——瑰丽雄奇的三十六峰和丰姿各异的九十九岩，站在发球台，所有的美景都能尽收眼底。我还在发愣，A君已经开始开球了。这支开球木是他的最新爱宠，TaylorMadeR9。今年3月TaylorMade推出的新款，据说是弹道控制技术和可调节重心技术完美融合，左右弹道调节可提升至75码，老将佩利最近在各个大赛中发挥稳定，曾对媒体盛赞这支杆功不可没。面对380码的球道，A君果然犹如佩利附体，发球不偏不倚，又准又快，表现堪比职业选手。打了前三洞后，我对武夷山风景的特点有了一定了解。都说无限风光在险峰，反过来讲，无数美丽风景也可怕。这是一个典型的山地球场，这也是一个真正用险奇自然打造的球场。球道依天然山谷的V造型而建，天然得近乎粗放，大起大落，没完没了的沙坑和湖泊，灌木障碍和丹霞地貌特有的红色突出岩石，每一样都说明它是匹烈马。不过哪个爱玩高尔夫的人不喜欢“驯马”呢？打到5号洞，一直表情严肃的夫子突然失笑，“我去年就在5号洞吃过亏，之前在网上看过攻略，觉得有把握，但是等真正上到发球台时，地势高风力大，一杆挥下去，力道过猛，直接发球出界了。重新站在这里，有点心理障碍。”5号球道确实很特别。球童说，这个球道发球台的地势很高，球道的落差接近50米，果岭周围分布中三块沙坑。远远看去“大珠小珠落玉盘”。5号洞以风景殊异而负有盛名，在发球台上我们看到大王峰，犹如一尊侧面横卧的睡美人。这次夫子吸取了教训，挥杆的时候颇有技巧，果然球在划过一道弧线后稳稳地停在了球道中，且离果岭距离正合适，他顺势一杆上果岭，然后再轻推入洞，球进了，以一记小鸟成功雪耻。全场18洞中，风景无处不在，惊险也无处不在。在这个吊诡的山地球场，几乎没有所谓的坦途。我们一面打，一面感叹这球场的段位不低。后九洞与前九大落差的风格完全不同。后九被山林相夹，几乎就是一个没有经过人工修饰的巨大山林屏障，对于球手的每一击都极具挑战性。其中尤以14号球道和16号球道令人畏惧。14号球道是一个左狗腿球道，还是一个双层果岭。整个球道分布着阔大的沙坑，难度大又充满挑战，低矮山林环抱着溪水芳草，处处都是让你无法提防的障碍，没有金刚钻，不敢揽这瓷器活。和14洞有异曲同工之妙的是16洞。与14号对称，它是一个右狗腿，也是球场最长的四杆洞，全场443码。果岭周围地势起伏不定，沙坑夹杂，湖面瀑布相伴，不仅能考验球手的基本功，更能比拼谋略。打球好几年，我已不是菜鸟。越是难打的洞，心态就越要平和。球刚一出手，我暗暗感觉不妙，果然，球顺着风劲一路狂飙，滚到了沙坑。沙坑边缘比较深，我救球丝毫找不到大师的潇洒劲，好不容易才灰头土脸地爬出来。筋疲力尽打完18洞，一看表已到了正午时间。回头一望，后面的球友还在挥汗作战，久经沙场的夫子擒了三鸟一鹰，打出+4。4月27日晴游溪本想下午再打一场，不过来了武夷山，不看风景太可惜。中餐过后，我们一行人酒足饭饱，来到九曲溪星村乘坐竹筏。都说不坐竹排，武夷白来。游九曲哪能不坐竹排？据说九曲溪的艄公是出了名的会讲掌故，错过他们就错过了武夷真正鲜活的民间文化。不过这边是有潜规则的。上了竹排，打点是必须的，要不然艄公不仅一言不发，还不给你们好脸色。为了下午的旅途能轻松点，我们一上筏子就马上给了这个姓肖的老艄公50块钱小费。“一溪贯群山，清浅萦九曲。溪边列岩岫，倒影浸寒绿”，肖师傅是专业级的，他一路娓娓道来：九曲溪发源于森林茂密的武夷山自然保护区，全长62.8公里。进入风景区的一段河流除自然弯曲外，还受多组岩层断裂方向控制，形成了独特的九曲回肠的自然奇观。9九曲溪水流清澈，水源充沛，水质达到国家地面水Ι类标准，住在这旁边的人，赛神仙。站在竹筏上，我们一路随着九曲溪蜿蜒自如，水贯山行，看溪水晶莹，可谓曲曲含异趣，湾湾藏佳景。武夷山人用竹筏作为交通工具1000多年的历史。我们问肖老师傅，现在的武夷山为什么还在使用这种比较原始的工具呢？肖师傅笑道，竹筏自有竹筏的妙用，它浮力大、吃水浅、船身轻便，转圜又极为灵活。他只要用一根竹篙，就可以自如控制任何局面。它可以平稳地漂过深潭，也可飞快地滑下浅滩；可以灵巧地避开突立中流的礁石，又可急剧地转弯。再说这样也比较环保。竹筏在九曲漂了近两个小时，终于抵达目的地——一曲武夷宫码头。要离开武夷山时，我们聊起球童介绍过的欢乐家庭包，商量着暑假时再一起带老婆孩子同来避暑。	武夷山,A君,老赵,夫子,小丽,Taylor,佩利,游溪,游九曲,艄公,肖,肖师傅,肖老师傅	正向	"From Wuyi Mountain in Fujian to NanSha in Guangzhou, the Southern Tour of Three Provinces and Three Golf Courses for those of us who are addicted to green opium, traveling around China to visit golf courses has become an addiction that can't be kicked. Like women who often shop in groups, people who play sports have their own little circles. I met A and Old Zhao through playing ball, and we have been accustomed to traveling together every year when the weather is still nice. Master was a ball friend who chatted about basketball online, we had been in touch for a long time without meeting in person. When it comes to late spring, April and May, it is the perfect time to play golf in the south. Talking about this with you all, we hit it off immediately. Go south to fight? Where do you want to play? Yunnan, Guangdong, Hainan… everywhere is a place that can't be let go. After a few people got together, they decided to go on a southern tour from southeast to southwest (they did not go to the southwest for some reason), and have a four-person version of the Southern Journey. Playing ball is the main thing, appreciating the scenery is the secondary thing, how can it not be pleasant! Then, we set out to find the court, taking six days to travel from the starting point of Wuyishan, Fujian to the end point of Nansha, Guangzhou, walking into three provinces and three courts, truly indulging in the joy of playing basketball, and experiencing a life of free and easy like a wandering cloud and a wild crane. It was precisely: eastern travels to seek immortals, western travels to worship Buddha, northern travels to harmonize things, and southern travels to play cuju. First stop: Wuyi Mountain Scenery is everywhere. The first golf course to visit is Wuyi Mountain Scenery Golf. This basketball court, Master Fu has been to, and he praised it highly. I only visited the famous scenic spot Wuyi in Fujian years ago and I haven't played there. What interests us is the business golf super value package recently launched by Wuyi Mountain. Stay for two nights, play two games, and send a buffet breakfast, and it costs more than a thousand yuan for one person. So we hurried to make a reservation. On the afternoon of April 25, when the initial meeting of Qingchu was held, A and I and Old Zhao took off from our city. The clouds were very thick, and it looked like it was going to rain soon. Arrive at Wuyi Mountain Airport in about two hours, the weather is very good, the sky is blue, and the mountains gather. As soon as I got off the plane, I saw the staff of Wuyi Mountain Scenery holding the pick-up board waiting at the exit, which was quite warm. The plane of Master was delayed, and we waited for him for nearly half an hour. He has the frankness of a northern man, tall and strong, and he is bound to be a big cannon. But Master was Master, and he started analyzing the field and the situation of this year's Players Championship as soon as he got on the bus. In the midst of chatting, we arrived at the Wuyi Mountain Scenic Golf Club. Everyone knows about the quirks of the Golfers. To play a good game, you need to choose a comfortable venue first. Comfortable playing field, the most important is whether the clubhouse is eye-catching or not. The scenery of Wuyi Mountain is said to be equipped with five-star resort hotels. Standing in the clubhouse, looking around, I was surrounded by the embrace of the mountains, and the white clouds were so close that they could almost be touched with the hand. The clubhouse is humble in comparison to the natural beauty around it. The style blends traditional northern Fujian architecture with modern architecture, simple but not boring, ""elegant in a low-key way"". In the evening, after we had eaten the farm-style dishes at the Chinese restaurant, several of us sat on the terrace, sipping tea and chatting. The trees outside the house cast shadows, and we occasionally heard the sound of birds. Thinking of the ancients' ""seven days in the mountains, a thousand years in the world,"" we felt a deep resonance. According to the principle of relativity, living there for a thousand years would probably seem too short. On the second day of the sunny discussion of the ball, we got up early. After having the free buffet breakfast provided by the hotel, I went to the court. As there are not many courts in Fujian, there are quite a few people coming to play. Reserve a tee time at 8 am. Before each game, I have a strange illness: I will first rehearse the scene of playing in the new court in my mind. This may be the area where I need to improve the most in playing, not being calm and composed enough. Arriving at the tee, take a pre-shot group photo as usual. Looking around, the scene is ethereal, the close-up is charming, and the distant view is vast. The caddy Xiaoli told us that Wuyi Mountain scenery is a typical mountain golf course. The entire stadium covers an area of 2,480 mu. But if you take a closer look, you will find that there is always more to see beyond the mountains. The outer layer of the golf course is the most famous natural scenery of Wuyi Mountain - the magnificent and magnificent Thirty-six Peaks and the various and various Ninety-nine Rocks, standing on the tee, all the beautiful scenery can be seen. I was still in a daze, but A-kun had already started to take the ball. This driver is his latest favorite, the TaylorMade R9. This year's March launch by TaylorMade, which is said to be a perfect blend of ball flight control technology and adjustable center of gravity technology, can adjust the left and right ball flight up to 75 yards. The veteran Perry has recently performed stably in various major competitions, and the media has praised this club for its great contribution. Facing a 380-yard fairway, A君 was indeed possessed by Pelly, hitting the ball straight and fast, as if he were a professional player. After the first three holes, I got a certain understanding of the characteristics of the Wuyi Mountain scenery. It is said that the scenery at the peak is the most beautiful, but conversely, the scenery that is beautiful can also be terrifying. This is a typical mountain golf course, which is also a truly natural course created with rugged and unique natural features. The fairways are built in the V-shape of the natural valley, rough and natural, with large ups and downs, endless sand traps and lakes, shrubbery obstacles and red protruding rocks unique to the Danxia landform, all of which indicate that it is a wild horse. But which golf lover doesn't like ""horseracing""? When Master reached the 5th hole, the Master, who had been serious all along, suddenly burst out laughing. ""I was tricked by the 5th hole last year. I had read the攻略on the Internet and felt confident, but when I actually got to the tee, the terrain was high and the wind was strong. When I swung the club, the force was too strong, and the ball went out of bounds."" Standing here again, there is a psychological barrier. No. 5 hole is indeed very special. The caddy said that the tee of this fairway is very high, the elevation difference of the fairway is nearly 50 meters, and there are three sand traps around the green. From afar, it looks like large and small pearls falling into a jade plate. No.5 hole is famous for its unique scenery, and on the tee, we can see the Great King Peak, which looks like a sleeping beauty lying on her side. This time, the master learned his lesson and hit the ball with great skill. Sure enough, the ball landed on the fairway after a graceful arc, and was at the right distance from the green. He then hit it onto the green and made a light tap to get it into the hole. The ball went in, and he made a birdie to avenge his loss. Scenic views and thrills are everywhere in 18 holes. There is hardly any smooth road in this paradoxical mountain stadium. We were amazed at the level of the court as we played. The back nine is completely different in style from the front nine. The 9th hole is almost a huge natural forest barrier surrounded by mountains and forests, which is extremely challenging for every shot of the player. Especially No. 14 and No. 16 holes are daunting. No.14 fairway is a left dogleg and has a two-tier green. The fairway is dotted with large bunkers, which are challenging and difficult, and low hills surround the stream and grass, with obstacles everywhere that you cannot guard against. Without the right tools, you dare not take on this porcelain work. The 16th hole is much the same as the 14th. Symmetrical with No. 14, it is a right dogleg, and also the longest par-4 hole on the course, 443 yards in total. The terrain around the green is uneven, with sand traps and lakes with waterfalls, not only testing the basic skills of the players, but also challenging their strategy. I have been playing for several years, so I am no longer a beginner. The more difficult the hole, the more one needs to maintain a calm mindset. As soon as the ball was hit, I felt something was wrong, and sure enough, the ball was blown by the wind and rolled into the sand trap. The edge of the sand trap is quite deep, and I can't find the master's elegance in saving the ball. I finally crawled out with a gray face. After playing 18 holes and exhausting myself, I looked at the watch and found it was noon. Looking back, the ball friends behind were still sweating and fighting. The veteran teacher caught three birds and an eagle, and hit +4. On April 27, it was sunny. You intended to play another game in the afternoon, but it would be a pity not to see the scenery after coming to Wuyi Mountain. After lunch, we all had our fill of food and went to Xingcun on Jiuquxi to ride a bamboo raft. They say that you would come to Wuyi in vain without riding a bamboo raft. How could you ride a bamboo raft when touring the Nine Bends? It is said that the boatmen on Jiuqu Creek are famous for telling anecdotes, and missing them means missing the real folk culture of Wuyi. But there are some unwritten rules here. On the bamboo raft, it is necessary to hit a few times, otherwise the boatman will not only be silent, but also not give you a good face. To make the afternoon trip easier, we immediately gave the old boatman surnamed Xiao a tip of 50 yuan as soon as we got on the raft. A stream runs through the mountains, clear and shallow, winding around nine bends. The rocks by the stream are arranged in rock formations, and their reflections are immersed in cold green. Master Xiao is a professional, and he has been talking all the way: Jiucu溪 is the source of the Jiucu Stream, which originates from the dense forest of the Wuyi Mountain Nature Reserve, with a total length of 62.8 kilometers. The river in the scenic area, apart from natural meandering, is also controlled by the direction of multiple sets of rock layer fractures, forming a unique natural wonder of nine meanders. The Nine Bends Stream flows clear, with abundant water and water quality reaching the national Class I standard for surface water. People living nearby are like immortals. Standing on the bamboo raft, we followed the Nine Bends Stream windingly, with water running through the mountains, and saw the crystal clear stream, which was full of different interests and beautiful scenery in every bend. For more than 1000 years, the people of Wuyi Mountain have used bamboo rafts as a means of transportation. We asked Master Xiao why Wuyi Mountain still uses such primitive tools now. Master Xiao smiled and said that the bamboo raft had its own advantages. It had a large buoyancy, shallow draft, and light body, and was extremely flexible and maneuverable. He can control any situation with just a bamboo pole. It can drift smoothly over deep pools, and slide quickly down shallow riffles; it can nimbly avoid the midstream rocks, and make sharp turns. And it's also more environmentally friendly. The bamboo raft floated for nearly two hours on the nine-bend river and finally arrived at the destination - Wu Yi Gong wharf on the first bend. When we were about to leave Wuyishan, we talked about the happy family package introduced by the caddie and decided to bring our wives and children together to escape the heat during the summer vacation."
小雨缓解美国旱情我国西南可能秋旱美国初霜冻影响有限，中西部地区迎小雨上周，受热带风暴Lee的影响，美国三角洲地区、东南棉区和东北部地区先后出现大到暴雨，有利于缓解当地旱情。但对于三角洲地区的大豆来说，这场降雨来得过晚，反而不利收割。美国中南、东南棉区的棉花采摘工作亦中断。美国中西部地区依然降水稀少，伊利诺伊州、印第安纳州累积降水量不足25毫米，只有偏东部的俄亥俄州、肯塔基州雨水较多。气温方面，上周美国中部平原和中西部地区降温明显，上述地区平均气温较常年偏低约4—6℃，不过中西部地区的气温多维持在白天24℃、夜间10℃左右，并未出现初霜冻。美国9月5—12日累积降水量实况图本周，美国中西部地区天气基本良好，虽然局部可能出现霜冻，但是预计影响不大。受冷空气影响，美国由中北至东南出现一轮降温过程，预计14—15日夜间北达科他州、明尼苏达州、威斯康辛州甚至爱荷华州局部可能出现初霜冻。由于玉米已基本成熟，故潜在霜冻威胁的主要是美国大豆产量。不过16日后，美国中西部地区将升温，升温有望持续至下周一，且中期预报认为9月18—22日美国北方大部气温较常年偏高。在降温的同时，美国中西部地区本周的降水概率亦将增大，土壤表墒改善利于大豆灌浆成熟。尽管天气以小雨为主，累积降水量不足以缓解旱情，但可遏制中西部地区旱情的发展。截至9月6日，全美的干旱面积在缩小，中西部地区的干旱面积继续小幅增加，但干旱程度基本维持中旱不变。预计在本周四USDA和NOAA联合发布的监测报告中，中西部地区的干旱形势可能依然不变。今年美国中西部地区前期土壤底墒良好，8月份才开始出现干旱，而且干旱面积和程度的发展速度不快，故这场干旱并不会对新作大豆造成严重影响。中国我国迎来”三秋大忙“，西南局部伏秋连旱进入9月，我国大部农业区迎来秋收、秋耕、秋播的”三秋大忙“。目前全国大部秋收作物发育期正常，预计能够正常腾茬，华北南部、黄淮部分地区可能略偏晚。冬麦和油菜产区大部气象条件利于秋播及冬小麦、油菜的生长，但部分地区的干旱可能影响农业生产。我国气象干旱监测首先，东北地区秋收天气基本良好，未来局部地区的霜冻对大豆、玉米、一季稻的产量影响轻微。9月上旬东北地区以晴为主，光照充足，虽然局部降水偏少以致出现气象干旱，但是大部农区土壤墒情适宜，利于作物灌浆和成熟；气温接近常年略偏低，旬末黑龙江北部林区和牧区出现初霜冻，但对粮食作物基本无影响。预计14日起，一股较强冷空气将自西北到东南先后影响我国大部分地区，其中华北北部、东北地区北部的部分地区降温幅度可超过10℃，15—18日黑龙江北部和西部的局部还将再次出现霜冻。降温将影响华北玉米、东北大豆、一季稻等秋收作物的灌浆和成熟速度，但由于主要农区并无霜冻，因此对产量的威胁有限。其次，北方冬麦区今年雨水充沛，土壤底墒良好，麦播形势较乐观。9月上旬北方冬麦区持续阴雨寡照，土壤偏湿，不利于前茬玉米、大豆的灌浆成熟和棉花的裂铃吐絮，腾茬期可能偏晚。不过土壤偏湿总比干旱令人欣慰，毕竟北方冬麦区入秋后雨水往往不多。预计18日以后我国华北、黄淮地区将恢复晴朗，配合排湿降渍，土壤过湿的问题可以缓解，冬小麦有望于9月下旬适时播种。最后，南方油菜产区形势分化，西南地区旱情持续。长江流域油菜产区大部土壤墒情适宜，利于油菜播种出苗，预计油菜将于9月中旬开始播种。而西南地区东南部自5月以来降水持续偏少，加之阶段性极端高温天气，截至9月12日四川东南部、重庆西部、云南东北部、贵州东部和西南部、湖南西部和广西东部部分地区存在轻至中度农业干旱。预计贵州东南部、重庆等地秋季降水依然偏少，未来可能出现伏秋连旱，不利于油菜适时播种。（作者单位：永安期货）		正向	"Light rain eases drought in the US, Southwest China may face autumn drought, initial frost impact is limited, Midwest to receive light rain Last week, the Delta region, southeastern cotton belt, and northeastern US experienced heavy to torrential rain due to the impact of Tropical Storm Lee, which is beneficial to ease the local drought. But the rains came too late for the soybeans in the Delta, which will be a hindrance to the harvest. The cotton harvest in the southern and southeastern cotton belt of the United States was also interrupted. The central United States is still experiencing a lack of precipitation, with less than 25 mm of accumulated precipitation in Illinois and Indiana, while the eastern parts of Ohio and Kentucky have received more rain. Regarding temperature, there was a significant cooling in the central plains and Midwest of the United States last week, with the average temperature in these regions about 4-6°C lower than normal. However, the temperature in the Midwest was mostly maintained at around 24°C during the day and 10°C at night, and there was no initial frost. Actual accumulated precipitation map for the United States from September 5 to 12. This week, the weather in the central United States was basically good, although there may be frost in some areas, but it is expected to have little impact. Affected by cold air, a cooling process occurred from north-central to southeast of the United States. It is expected that parts of North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and even Iowa may experience the first frost of the season on the night of the 14th and 15th. Since the corn is nearly mature, the potential frost threat is mainly to the US soybean crop. However, 16 days later, the central United States will experience a rise in temperature, and the rise in temperature is expected to continue until next Monday, and the mid-term forecast suggests that most of the northern United States will have higher temperatures than normal from September 18 to 22. While temperatures cool, the chance of precipitation in the US Midwest this week will increase, which will improve soil moisture conditions and benefit soybean pod filling and maturation. Although the weather was mainly light rain, the accumulated precipitation was not enough to alleviate the drought, but it could curb the development of the drought in the central and western regions. As of September 6, the area of drought in the United States is shrinking, and the area of drought in the central and western regions continues to increase slightly, but the degree of drought is basically maintained at moderate drought. The drought situation in the Midwest is likely to remain unchanged in the joint monitoring report to be released by the USDA and NOAA this Thursday. This year, the soil moisture in the US Midwest was good at the beginning of the season, and drought only began in August. Moreover, the development speed of the drought area and degree was not fast, so this drought will not have a significant impact on the new crop soybeans. With the arrival of the ""three autumn busy season"" in China, the southwest region experienced a continuous drought from the autumn to the autumn since September, and the majority of the agricultural areas in China welcomed the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing of the ""three autumn busy season"". Currently, the development period of most autumn crops in the country is normal, and it is expected to be harvested on time. However, some parts of southern North China and the Yellow River Basin may be slightly delayed. Most of the winter wheat and rape planting areas have favorable meteorological conditions for autumn sowing and the growth of winter wheat and rape, but drought in some areas may affect agricultural production. First, the weather for autumn harvest in Northeast China is basically good, and the future local frost will have a slight impact on the yield of soybeans, corn, and one-season rice. During the early part of September, most of the northeastern region was mainly sunny with adequate sunshine. Although local precipitation was less than normal, leading to meteorological drought, the soil moisture in most of the agricultural areas was suitable, which was conducive to the grain filling and maturation of crops. The temperature was slightly lower than normal, and the northern part of Heilongjiang Province experienced the first frost at the end of the month, but it had little impact on the grain crops. Starting from the 14th, a strong cold air will successively affect most parts of our country from the northwest to the southeast. Among them, the temperature drop in some parts of the northern part of the North China region and the northern part of the Northeast region can exceed 10℃. From the 15th to the 18th, local areas in the northern and western parts of Heilongjiang will experience frost again. The cooling will affect the grain filling and maturation speed of autumn crops such as corn in North China, soybeans in Northeast China, and one-season rice, but the threat to production is limited as there is no frost in the main agricultural areas. Secondly, the northern winter wheat area has had abundant rainfall this year, with good soil moisture at the beginning of the season, and the prospects for wheat sowing are optimistic. In the upper part of September, the northern winter wheat area experienced continuous overcast and rainy weather with less sunshine, leading to soil moisture that was slightly higher than normal, which was not conducive to the grain filling and maturity of the previous crop corn and soybeans, and the pod opening and fiber shedding of cotton. The harvest period may be delayed. But it is still more comforting that the soil is slightly wet rather than dry, after all, autumn rains in the northern winter wheat areas are often scarce. It is expected that after the 18th, the North China and Huang-Huai regions will return to clear weather, which will help to reduce soil moisture and alleviate the problem of excessive soil moisture. Winter wheat is expected to be sown in a timely manner in the lower part of September. Finally, the situation of the southern rape production areas has diverged, and the drought in the southwestern region continues. Most of the soil moisture conditions in the rape production areas along the Yangtze River are suitable, which is conducive to the sowing and emergence of rape. It is expected that rape will begin to be sown in mid-September. Since May, the southeastern part of Southwest China has had less precipitation, and the phased extreme high temperature weather has led to light to moderate agricultural drought in some parts of southeastern Sichuan, western Chongqing, northeastern Yunnan, eastern and southwestern Guizhou, western Hunan, and eastern Guangxi by September 12. It is expected that the southeast of Guizhou and Chongqing will still have less precipitation in autumn, and a continuous drought from summer to autumn may occur in the future, which is not conducive to the timely sowing of rape.

百余美军政人员作证宣称看过外星人中新网9月27日电据台湾“中广新闻网”27日报道，一百多名美国退役军人、公务员作证宣称自己看过外星人。还说这些外星人对人类的核武器特别有兴趣。根据这些所谓的“外星人目击者”宣称：过去五十多年来外星人经常造访地球。依据他们的证词，美国、英国、墨西哥和伊朗都出现过UFO。有人还自称看过UFO的残骸以及活着或是死掉的外星人。一名目击者表示，1967年他在蒙大拿州一个空军基地服役时就看到UFO飞到基地上空，停在空中。当时基地的十枚义勇兵核弹头全部失效。一个月以后，UFO又去了，导弹又失效了一次。他们的结论是，外星人对地球没有恶意。不过他们很关心地球的核武以及星战计划。		正向	"More than a hundred US military and political personnel testified that they had seen aliens. September 27, 2022, according to the Taiwan ""China Radio and Television News Network"" report on the 27th, more than a hundred US veterans and civil servants testified that they had seen aliens. They also said that these aliens were particularly interested in human nuclear weapons. According to these so-called ""alien witnesses"": aliens have frequently visited the earth in the past fifty years. According to their testimony, UFOs have appeared in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Iran. Some even claim to have seen the remains of a UFO and living or dead aliens. A witness said that in 1967, when he was serving at an air force base in Montana, he saw a UFO fly to the base and hover in the air. At that time, all ten义勇兵 nuclear warheads of the base were失效. A month later, the UFO came again, and the missile failed again. Their conclusion is that aliens have no ill will toward the Earth. But they are very concerned about the nuclear weapons on Earth and the Star Wars program."
30天令CBA升级名额巨变凤铝连投诉的机会都没有新赛季CBA出现第3支广东球队的可能性已变为0，广东凤铝铝材队在这场角逐中输给天津荣钢队，彻底无缘CBA.CBA联席会议曾在今年5月确定了2008-2009赛季CBA联赛的升级要件，主要是以今年NBL联赛成绩作为升级硬件指标，但昨日召开的联席会议上，却临时以投票形式进行公决，结果今年获NBL冠军的广东凤铝反被名次落在自己后面的天津和青岛压倒———16位CBA俱乐部总经理外加篮管中心联赛办公室经投票，天津以10票高居榜首，青岛获得6票，先前最热门的凤铝仅得到1票，得票最高的天津荣钢俱乐部就此荣升CBA.赴京出席了此次联席会议的凤铝俱乐部常务副总经理肖青龙称，俱乐部对这个结果已有所预见。据肖青龙透露，前日其赴京准备列席此次联席会议时，就有个别CBA俱乐部老总半开玩笑式地跟他讲：“你们凤铝(冲A)没戏了！”肖青龙称，这一情形当时即令其感觉不妙，随即也与大本营做过沟通，只是不想先前的传言竟在次日的联席会上一语成谶。记者电话采访凤铝队主教练王绪林时也得到这一印证，“我自己还有全体队员昨天都听说了我们队可能会升级无望的事。”电话中王绪林的失望之情清晰可感：“(今年)8月4日篮协来我们俱乐部进行CBA准入评估时，对我们各项软硬件都说满意，当时我还问过带队的(篮管中心党委书记)刘晓农和(CBA联赛办公室主任)张雄，他们都说我们升级没问题，谁知道还是闹了个现在这种结果。”虽然自8月1日起凤铝队就开始了集训，但队伍升级失利很可能会让这些来自五湖四海的队员们各奔东西。昨晚，身在俱乐部三水大本营的董事长吴小源听完前方的汇报后已经明确表态，接下来不排除凤铝撤资退出中国篮坛的可能性。	肖青龙,王绪林,刘晓农,张雄,吴小源	负向	"30 days made the CBA promotion slots dramatically change. Fenglu had no chance to complain. The possibility of a third Guangdong team in the new season CBA has become 0. Guangdong Fenglu Aluminum Materials Team lost to Tianjin Ronggang Team in this competition, and was completely out of CBA. The CBA Joint Conference had determined the promotion criteria for the 2008-2009 season CBA League in May this year, mainly using the results of this year's NBL League as the hardware indicators for promotion. But at the joint conference held yesterday, it was decided by voting. The result is that the Guangdong Fenglu, which won the NBL championship this year, was defeated by Tianjin and Qingdao, which were behind it in the ranking - 16 CBA club general managers and the league office of the Basketball Management Center voted. Tianjin ranked first with 10 votes, Qingdao got 6 votes, and Fenglu, which was previously the most popular, only got 1 vote. The Tianjin Ronggang Club with the highest number of votes was promoted to CBA. Fenglu's vice general manager Xiao Qinglong, who attended the joint conference in Beijing, said that the club had foreseen the result. According to Xiao Qinglong, some CBA club presidents joked with him the day before yesterday when he went to Beijing to attend this joint meeting that ""Your Fengleng (promoting A) is out of the question!"" Xiao Qinglong said that he felt something was wrong with the situation at the time, and he had also communicated with the headquarters, but he did not expect that the rumors that had spread the day before would come true at the joint meeting the next day. When the reporter interviewed Wang Xulin, the head coach of Fenglun team by phone, he also got this confirmation, ""I and all the players heard yesterday that our team may not be promoted."" Wang Xulin’s disappointment was clearly audible over the phone: ""When the CBA Association came to our club for the CBA admission assessment on August 4, they said that they were satisfied with all of our hardware and software. At that time, I even asked Liu Xiaonong, the Party Secretary of the Basketball Management Center, and Zhang Xiong, the Director of the CBA League Office, who both said that there was no problem with our promotion. Who would have thought that we would end up in this situation."" Although the Fenglv team has been training since August 1, the failure of the team to upgrade may cause these players from all over the country to go their separate ways. Last night, Chairman Wu Xiaoyuan, who was at the San Shui base of the club, had already clearly stated that the possibility of Fenglun withdrawing from the Chinese basketball league cannot be ruled out in the future after listening to the report from the front."

梦八抵达上海安保更严格浦东机场获联盟高管盛赞记者沈知渝上海报道从彻夜不眠，灯火通宵的赌城澳门，“梦八”在两个小时以后，飞到了姚明的城市。这不再是弹丸之地，这里的人口，是澳门的30倍，黄浦江缓缓地流过城市的心脏，就像上海的血脉，给这座城市灌输着蕴秀灵气，东方明珠和城隍庙，浦东和浦西，贯通着千年文明。美国队的大个子们，还没机会去深入历史。最先映入眼帘的，是壮阔雄伟的浦东机场，而这也让他们惊叹，第一次来到中国的NBA公关主管布莱恩·麦克金农瞪着眼睛说：“机场真是太漂亮了，这个机场是新建的吗？”工作人员扮演球迷因为没有专机，只能搭乘商业客机，从澳门来上海。中午1点多，美国队登上上海航空FM818航班，直奔上海浦东。3点30分，飞机稳稳地降落在浦东国际机场。走出机舱，一眼看去，是浓浓的奥运气氛，五个福娃笑盈盈地看着这群大个子，北京奥运的标志，在过道上随处可见，霍华德大笑着说：“我真是非常兴奋。”比他们更兴奋的是机场的工作人员。在浦东机场，他们没有遇见球迷，没有看见标语，于是工作人员临时扮演了这个角色。当科比，詹姆斯，安东尼，韦德从他们面前鱼贯而过时，这些早有准备的工作人员放下了平日的矜持和严肃，跑着上去，和这些NBA的巨星们要求合影，要求签名。于是走了一大圈，满足了这些临时球迷的要求，美国队才跳上大巴，直扑下榻的波特曼酒店。一路上，大巴开过浦东宽阔平整的大道，收入眼帘的，尽是纽约芝加哥市中心一般的万丈高楼，他们啧啧地充满了惊叹。那些来过中国的，心里早有了数，上海是座怎样的城市，那些没来过中国的，置身于这样的繁华中，惊奇不已。45分钟，大巴抵达波特曼酒店。卸行李，领房卡，进房间，时针就慢慢走向了6点。可训练课还是没法省略，7点多，他们走下房间，上了大巴，开往静安体育馆。静安体育馆，其实就在波特曼酒店隔壁，可怎么也不能让美国队的大腕们走着过去，于是开车绕一圈，开进体育馆。这里头没有专业球迷，可也有临时的。穿着制服的警察，兴致勃勃地举着小相机，站在场边，对着使劲练投篮的美国队，摁下一回又一回，高兴地笑着。	沈知渝,布莱恩·麦克金农,霍华德,科比,詹姆斯,安东尼,韦德	正向	"The Dream Team arrived in Shanghai, and the security was stricter. The Pudong Airport received high praise from the league executives. Journalist Shen Zhiyu reported from Shanghai. After staying awake all night and the lights were still on in the gambling city of Macao, the ""Dream Eight"" arrived in Yao Ming's city two hours later. This is no longer a small place, the population here is 30 times that of Macao, the Huangpu River flows slowly through the heart of the city, like the blood of Shanghai, infusing this city with the charm of civilization, the Oriental Pearl and the City God Temple, Pudong and Puxi, connecting a thousand years of civilization. The American big men have yet to make their mark in history. The first thing that caught the eye was the magnificent Pudong Airport, which also amazed them. Brian McKinnon, the NBA public relations manager who came to China for the first time, said with wide eyes, ""The airport is really beautiful. Is this airport newly built?"" The staff played the fans because there was no special aircraft, and could only take a commercial airliner from Macau to Shanghai. At around 1:00 PM, the US team boarded Shanghai Airlines flight FM818 and headed straight for Pudong, Shanghai. At 3:30, the plane landed steadily at Pudong International Airport. Step out of the cabin, and you can see the thick Olympic atmosphere. Five Fuwa are smiling at this group of giants. The Beijing Olympic logo can be seen everywhere in the aisle. Howard said with a big smile, ""I am really excited."" More excited than them were the staff at the airport. At Pudong Airport, they did not meet the fans and did not see the slogans, so the staff temporarily played this role. When Kobe, James, Anthony, and Wade passed by them one after another, these prepared staff members put aside their usual reserve and seriousness, ran up to them, and asked for photos and autographs from these NBA superstars. Then, after a long circuit, the US team got on the bus to head to the Borland Hotel, which was where they were staying, to meet the needs of these temporary fans. Along the way, the large bus drove on the wide and flat roads of Pudong, and all that could be seen were skyscrapers like those in the center of New York and Chicago, which filled them with admiration. Those who have been to China know well what kind of city Shanghai is, and those who have not been to China are amazed at such prosperity. The coach arrived at the Portland Hotel in 45 minutes. Unloading luggage, getting room cards, entering the room, the minute hand slowly approached 6 o'clock. The training session could not be skipped, and at around 7:00, they walked out of the room, got on the bus, and headed to Jingan Sports Center. Jingan Sports Center is actually right next to the Plaza Hotel, but the big stars of the US team could not walk over, so they drove around and entered the sports center. There are no professional fans here, but there are also temporary ones. The policeman in uniform was excitedly holding a small camera and standing on the sideline, pressing it again and again, smiling happily at the American team who was practicing shooting baskets."

It is said that the window for Chinese companies to list in the US has closed recently. Two more companies have applied for listing. Due to the poor market conditions, they are worried that listing in the US IPO will not achieve ideal valuation.迅雷 and 盛大文学 both delayed their US IPO, and who will take the first step to test the waters in the future is also closely watched by the market. Reporter Su Dongdong reported that Tuhu.com will list on NASDAQ market in the next two days and plan to raise 120 million US dollars. And this is the latest news on Potato's IPO filing since last November. The PR department of T土豆网 stated yesterday that it was inconvenient to comment on this matter. The sharp decline of the pre-listing Chinese stocks shocked the industry and made many industry insiders believe that the window for going public in the US had closed. Many industry insiders do not have a good outlook for Tudou's IPO at this time. On the other hand, Top Vision Technology and Kaisai Biotechnology submitted IPO applications against the trend, but due to the small market impact, they also found it difficult to shoulder the responsibility of opening a new window for listing. Tudou has cleared the obstacles to listing on NASDAQ. Li Yan, a spokesperson for Tudou, told the reporter that as of now, Tudou has not yet announced the price range, and the possibility of listing in the near future is small. It was previously reported that Tuhao would delay its IPO until November. But the analysis suggests that, with the CEO’s property disputes just resolved,土豆网 is basically free of the obstacles to listing, and that it may prioritize listing over other considerations, such as the competitive landscape of video websites and venture capital pressure. China's video websites Youku and Kua6 have already listed in the US, and Tuhu, Xunlei's Xunlei See, PPS, and others are in line. In the field of legitimate long videos, there are also Qiyi and Sohu Video. It is only natural that companies that go public later will have to spend more effort explaining their differences and advantages from their predecessors, and it will be more difficult to gain recognition. Moreover, as more companies went public in the US, copyright issues were gradually taken more seriously, and each company vied to spend huge sums of money to acquire content. The CEO of Tudou, Wang Wei, said that Tudou would not reduce its investment in copyright purchase and content providers, and would establish an industry barrier in original video UGC and self-produced content. The data shows that as of March 31, 2011, Tudou's cash and cash equivalents were $31.91 million, while Youku's was $253 million. Youku, which boasts of being the first Chinese video website to go public in the US, has attracted a lot of attention, and relies on the funds and traffic support from its parent companies such as Sohu and Qiyi. Heavyweight companies or break the window period to delay the IPO, and both Suning literature and迅雷 said that the current situation in the US market is not good, and the value of the company cannot be reflected. The prevailing view outside is that the window for Chinese companies to list in the US is now closed and is unlikely to recover in the short term. But some venture capitalists believe that the popularity of Youku and dangdang at the time of their listings greatly raised the overall expectations of Chinese companies, and that it is difficult to recreate the high valuation premium in the current listing, but it is not necessary to be ""alarmed by the wind and the cry of cranes"" for this. Recently, Top Vision Technology and Kaisai Biotechnology submitted their IPO applications to the SEC. According to the information, Kaisai Bio is an industrial biotechnology company, and Top Vision Technology is developing electronic coupon business. Due to low attention, it has not attracted the market's attention. But in poor market conditions, the two companies set the issue price above $12, raising $750 million and $897 million, leaving many investors in shock.

The data shows that as of March 31, 2011, Tudou's cash and cash equivalents were $31.91 million, while Youku's was $253 million. Youku, which boasts of being the first Chinese video website to go public in the US, has attracted a lot of attention, and relies on the funds and traffic support from its parent companies such as Sohu and Qiyi. Heavyweight companies or break the window period to delay the IPO, and both Suning literature and迅雷 said that the current situation in the US market is not good, and the value of the company cannot be reflected. The prevailing view outside is that the window for Chinese companies to list in the US is now closed and is unlikely to recover in the short term. But some venture capitalists believe that the popularity of Youku and dangdang at the time of their listings greatly raised the overall expectations of Chinese companies, and that it is difficult to recreate the high valuation premium in the current listing, but it is not necessary to be ""alarmed by the wind and the cry of cranes"" for this. Recently, Top Vision Technology and Kaisai Biotechnology submitted their IPO applications to the SEC. According to the information, Kaisai Bio is an industrial biotechnology company, and Top Vision Technology is developing electronic coupon business. Due to low attention, it has not attracted the market's attention. But in poor market conditions, the two companies set the issue price above $12, raising $750 million and $897 million, leaving many investors in shock."

Sina Entertainment News [News] In late 2008, the most eye-catching dance king album - Roy Chiao's ""The Legend of the Trendy Man"" was launched with great success, and immediately became the champion of various hit charts, including major record sales, online and new media play hit charts. With the competition for the year-end popular idol to release a new album, Luo Zhixiang has been walking through the wind and rain, and has worked hard to promote the new film. In order to thank everyone for supporting him, Golden Wind Records decided to release a reissue album at the beginning of the new year in 2009. Not only did they offer two CDs to show their sincerity and thank everyone for their support, but they also sent many gifts, such as a huge poster for the cool man, a [cool man postcard], etc. This is a super large size luxury hardcover gift, which is unique and can't be missed! ! Roger's first lyrics were deeply moving, ""Write a Song for You"". It was once pirated and leaked. In addition to the 10 new songs that play with the trend in the album, this version, Roger specially added a song of his own creation for a year, invited his musical talent friend Cao Ge to write the lyrics, and added his first personal lyrics, expressing his true feelings, for the fans who have supported him all along and who he loves most, because no matter when and where, he can feel the warmth of their care and protection, hoping to convey his love through this song, without words, just hum the melody, and communicate with Roger's true heart. Since the illegal pirates had once put the song on the Internet for free trial listening and downloading, in order to punish this immoral behavior, before the release of ""The Legend of the Cool Guy"", Lao Zhi Xiang had to cut this song and exclude it from the album, which can be regarded as the most painful loss of his career in 2008. This time, ""Write a Song for You"" is included in the re-edited album. Roger's wish is very simple. ""My fans have always said that I have never written a song for them. I never expected to write a song for them, but I encountered the situation of piracy and leakage. However, no matter what, I want to feel that my heart and heart are together with my fans. And this kind of emotion is also what I want to sing out very much! A collection of Lo Zixiang's cool male fashion looks was staged on the black and white piano keys. During the launch period, it set a good record, and the sales boom also continued to the lunar new year. He specially asked the record company to add a thoughtful gift to the revised product to thank everyone. Therefore, this version was specially added 5 cool male postcards and a huge poster in a set. Collect all the cool male looks in this album. Therefore, Little Pig worked harder to promote this album in various programs, and told the whole world more prominently that this album was his most participated and most creative new work. On the cover of the difficult remaster album, Luo Zhixiang's toes are on the antique piano, cool and handsome to the extreme. As soon as the cover was revealed, he shouted, ""This photo is not a digital composite!"" Originally, this new look came from Heavenly King Luo's sudden inspiration. The record company thought it was very good and carefully adopted it. They did not expect that it would be extremely difficult to shoot! The antique piano under Zixiang Luo's feet has a history of more than a hundred years and needs special care. In order to achieve the creative effect of playing the piano with the toes, Luo Zixiang must shift the center of gravity of his whole body to above the chest. In order to prevent injuries caused by falling off the piano, the record company also made many safety measures to ensure his safety. It is not difficult to see from the finished design that the difficulty of this costume. The perfect King Luo fell on the piano over ten times, and only felt satisfied, ""In fact, every time the shooting was very hard, very tired. Although this creative idea was proposed by me, when it was really shot, I was still quite reluctant. Can this really be shot? When it was finally completed, I was still moved, it seems that there is nothing that can't be done in the world as long as you dare to try! """
嘉丽士漆立体式渠道3+3粘性营销模式效果突出随着渠道与消费趋势的变化，涂料市场已发生深刻的变化，嘉丽士把握涂料市场脉搏，积极调整营销策略，在渠道上开疆拓土，大力发展工程、家具渠道取得了可观的成就。据悉，8月17日，嘉丽士漆西区销售部酒泉嘉丽士已成功在工程渠道打开了突破口，取得了酒泉职业技术学院五栋教学楼全部内外墙漆的大单以及中标鸿源小区全部外墙漆。此外，嘉峪关市图书馆内墙漆也全部采用嘉丽士漆；嘉丽士氟碳漆走进云南省昭通市唯一一家五星级酒店——江山大酒店。同时，西区销售部还积极介入当地家具厂。目前，山西太原嘉丽士正在筹备太原嘉丽士专业家具漆旗舰店，抢占当地家具漆市场……种种迹象表明，嘉丽士正在开拓工程、家具渠道，发展势头看好。今年的涂料市场比较冷淡，市场需求也在大幅度萎缩，这是大多数涂料人的感受。然而，实质上并非如此。萎缩的可能是在某个或者某些渠道，而萎缩掉的这部分份额正转向了工程、家具等渠道。整体而言，市场仍旧在那里，只是渠道与消费趋势变化很大。有着较强市场洞察力与敏感性的企业凭借自身的实力，迅速转型肯定会大有“钱途”。嘉丽士漆捕捉到市场形势的变化。在嘉丽士2011年第二季度年中培训会议上，嘉丽士张文辉总经理提出紫光大道3+3粘性营销之赢利倍增模式，明确指出嘉丽士以后的重点将逐步向立体化渠道发展倾斜，将把工程渠道与家具渠道的发展作为嘉丽士拓展渠道的途径，大战拳脚。此前嘉丽士就展现了它拓展渠道的能力。8月2日，嘉丽士漆成功中标山西省中医附属医院内墙装修工程。7月30日，嘉丽士成功中标山西壶关县城乡改造工程，壶关县改造街道建筑将全部采用嘉丽士外墙漆。7月29日，山东济宁市“鸟巢”体育馆决定采用嘉丽士内墙乳胶漆……日前，嘉丽士漆工程漆渠道正续写辉煌，创造立体渠道增长点。在此期间，嘉丽士家具漆也毫不逊色，凭借着与诸多世界化工巨头如罗门哈斯、拜耳、巴斯夫、杜邦等建立了良好的原料和技术合作关系，进口环保树脂等原辅助材料、技术研发力强、全自动生产工艺等七大产品技术优势以及七大支持政策：产品政策支持、人员支持、服务标准、特价体制、贴补利息、硬件支持、培训支持，与云鹤木门、联发家具、安居衍凯家具装饰、宝想家具、伯利恒家具有限公司、昌福实木、昌盛家具、长虹家具、长虹家具厂、大力华家具有限公司、大张庄家具、德克家具公司达成了战略合作伙伴。	嘉丽士,张文辉	正向	"The effect of the Caris立体 channel 3+3 sticky marketing model is outstanding. With the change of the channel and consumption trend, the paint market has undergone profound changes. Caris grasps the pulse of the paint market, actively adjusts the marketing strategy, develops the channel, and achieves remarkable achievements in the engineering and furniture channels. It is reported that on August 17, the Xiqi Sales Department of Jalis漆 in Jiuquan successfully broke through in the engineering channel, winning a large order for all the interior and exterior walls of five teaching buildings of Jiuquan Vocational and Technical College, as well as all the exterior walls of Hongyuan residential area. In addition, all the inner walls of the Jiayuguan City Library are painted with Jialishi paint; Jialishi fluorocarbon paint has entered the only five-star hotel in Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province - Jiangshan Grand Hotel. Meanwhile, the West District Sales Department also actively intervened in local furniture factories. Currently, Jali Shi in Taiyuan, Shanxi is preparing for the opening of the Jali Shi professional furniture paint flagship store in Taiyuan, and is competing for the local furniture paint market … Various signs show that Jali Shi is expanding the engineering and furniture channels, and the development momentum is good. This year's paint market is relatively cold, and the demand is shrinking significantly, which is the feeling of most paint people. However, in fact, it is not so. The shrinkage may be in one or more channels, and the lost share is shifting to engineering, furniture, and other channels. Overall, the market is still there, but the channels and consumption trends have changed a lot. Companies with strong market insight and sensitivity will definitely have a promising ""money prospect"" by transforming themselves quickly with their own strength. Caris漆 caught the change in the market situation. At the mid-year training meeting of Caris in the second quarter of 2011, General Manager Zhang Wenhui of Caris proposed the profit doubling model of 3+3 sticky marketing on the Purple Light Avenue, clearly pointing out that Caris' focus in the future will gradually shift to the development of three-dimensional channels, and will take the development of engineering channels and furniture channels as the way for Caris to expand its channels, fighting with full force. Previously, Carries had demonstrated its ability to expand its channels. On August 2, Galleries漆 successfully won the interior wall decoration project of Shanxi Province Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital. On July 30, Jalis succeeded in winning the urban and rural renovation project in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, and all the buildings on the streets of Huguan County will use Jalis exterior paint. On July 29, the Bird's Nest Sports Hall in Jining City, Shandong Province decided to use Jialishi interior latex paint... Recently, the Jialishi paint engineering paint channel is continuing to create brilliance and create a three-dimensional channel growth point. During this period, Jalis Furniture Paint was no less impressive, relying on its good raw material and technical cooperation with many world chemical giants such as Rohm and Haas, Bayer, BASF, DuPont, etc., importing environmental protection resins and other raw auxiliary materials, strong technical research and development, full automatic production process and other seven product technology advantages, and seven support policies: product policy support, personnel support, service standards, special price system, interest subsidy, hardware support, training support, and strategic partners were reached with Yunhe Wood Doors, Lianfa Furniture, Anju Yan Kai Furniture Decoration, Baoxiang Furniture, Bethlehem Furniture Co., Ltd., Changfu Solid Wood, Changsheng Furniture, Changhong Furniture, Changhong Furniture Factory, Dalihua Furniture Co., Ltd., Dashangzhuang Furniture, and Dek Furniture Co., Ltd."
CPI重磅出炉农产品多数回落15日早盘国内商品走势较为分化，其中，农产品多数回落，唯棉花及白糖翻红，基金属及能源化工整体维持震荡偏多走势。CPI数据低于市场预期，紧缩政策预期下降，预计短期市场将延续震荡整理走势。国家统计局15日公布，1月份CPI同比上涨4.9%。环比上涨1.0%。1月份PPI同比上涨6.6%；环比上涨0.9%。对此，海通期货研究所所长郭洪钧表示，CPI数据出乎市场预料，低于市场预期，紧缩政策预期下降，利好股市。对于大宗商品走势的影响短期呈中性，长期来看属利好。不过，国家信息中心15日在一份报告中表示，作为抗击通货膨胀及遏制资产泡沫政策组合的一部分，中国央行年内很可能继续加息和上调存款准备金率。国家信息中心表示，为把好流动性总闸门，调整存款准备金率是中国央行的首选工具，并称，未来存款准备金率最高可能上调至23%左右。目前国内存款准备金率为19%。国家信息中心还称，未来央行继续加息势在必行，因为加息可以有效抑制资产价格泡沫。国家信息中心还表示，预计2011年人民币将继续逐步升值。2月15日在安徽粮食批发交易市场及其联网市场举行国家临时存储食用油竞价交易会，本次计划销售菜籽油99626吨，实际成交92759吨，成交率93.11%，成交均价9688元/吨。本次拍卖，成交率再次放大，成交均价也有较大升幅，上次1月18日菜油拍卖成交率89%，均价为9365元/吨。随着前期油脂市场期现价格的走高，菜油拍卖底价对市场具有吸引力较大。自2010年10月份至今，国家累计投放7批临储菜籽油，共计划销售89.4万吨，实际成交77.2万吨，成交量86.4%，有效增加市场油脂供应量。今日菜油拍卖成交良好，对期货盘面菜油价格形成支撑，走势强于豆油、棕榈油。大连玉米期货早盘维持高位整理，主力1109合约以2464元/吨开盘，收盘价2,459元/吨，下跌5元/吨。受隔夜国际玉米价格回落拖累，连玉米早盘维持整理。不过国内旱情忧虑及需求旺盛持续支撑价格，但高位抛压将加重，预计连玉米震荡料将加剧。豆油期货早盘震荡小跌，主力1109合约开盘10,792元/吨，收盘10,818元/吨，下跌22元/吨。隔夜美豆类期货出现高位调整行情，外盘对国内油脂市场提振作用削弱。不过，国内价格也低于进口成本价格抑制了国内油脂下跌空间。虽然市场上涨趋势仍未发生变化，但短期回调风险仍存。棕榈油期货早盘呈高位震荡。1109主力合约以10,088元/吨开盘，收盘10,118元/吨，下跌28元/吨。马来西亚棕榈油及美豆类期货均出现高位调整行情，外盘提振作用削弱。但在港口货源集中、进口成本与盘面价格倒挂严重影响下，期价较为抗跌。走势来看，目前上升形态保持完好，但由于缺乏新的推涨动力，多空资金在当前价位抗衡，存在一定的回调风险，但预计幅度不大。作者：科创信息王云汉	郭洪钧,王云汉	正向	The CPI has been released, and most agricultural products have fallen. In the early morning of the 15th, the domestic commodity market showed a divided trend, with most agricultural products falling, while cotton and sugar turned red. The basic metals and energy chemicals maintained an overall fluctuating and bullish trend. CPI data is lower than market expectations, and the expectation of tight monetary policy has declined. It is expected that the market will continue to fluctuate in the short term. The National Bureau of Statistics announced on the 15th that the year-on-year increase of CPI in January was 4.9%. Up 1.0% month-over-month. PPI in January rose 6.6% year on year and 0.9% month on month. Guo Hongjun, the director of the research institute of Haitong Futures, said that the CPI data was lower than the market's expectation, which reduced the expectation of tightening policies and was beneficial to the stock market. The impact on the trend of primary commodities is neutral in the short term and favorable in the long term. However, on the 15th, the National Information Center said in a report that, as part of a policy mix to fight inflation and curb asset bubbles, the PBOC is likely to continue raising interest rates and reserve requirement ratios this year. The National Information Center said that to control the total amount of liquidity, adjusting the reserve requirement ratio is the People’s Bank of China’s preferred tool, and that the reserve requirement ratio may be raised to around 23% in the future. Currently, the reserve requirement ratio in China is 19%. The National Information Center also said that further interest rate hikes by the central bank were inevitable, as interest rate hikes could effectively curb asset price bubbles. The National Information Center also expects the RMB to continue to appreciate gradually in 2011. On February 15, a national temporary storage edible oil bidding trading meeting was held at Anhui Grain Wholesale Trading Market and its networked markets. This time, 99,626 tons of rapeseed oil were planned for sale, with actual transactions of 92,759 tons, a transaction rate of 93.11%, and an average transaction price of 9,688 yuan per ton. The auction saw a further increase in the rate of success and a significant rise in the average price. The rate of success for the rapeseed oil auction on January 18 was 89%, with an average price of 9,365 yuan per ton. With the rise of the futures and spot prices of the early vegetable oil market, the auction floor price of rapeseed oil has a greater appeal to the market. Since October 2010, the state has released a total of 7 batches of temporary storage rapeseed oil, with a planned sales volume of 894,000 tons, and the actual transaction volume is 772,000 tons, with a transaction rate of 86.4%, effectively increasing the supply of market fats and oils.

However, the domestic drought concerns and strong demand continue to support prices, but the selling pressure at high levels will increase, and it is expected that the fluctuations of continuous corn will intensify. Early morning trading of soybean oil futures fluctuated slightly lower. The main 1109 contract opened at 10,792 yuan per ton and closed at 10,818 yuan per ton, down 22 yuan per ton. The overnight US bean futures saw a high adjustment, and the ex-pen market's supporting effect on the domestic oil market weakened. But the domestic price is lower than the import cost price, which restrains the downward pressure on domestic oils. Although the upward trend in the market has not changed, the risk of short-term correction still exists. Palm oil futures traded in a range at high levels in the morning session. The main contract opened at 10,088 yuan/ton and closed at 10,118 yuan/ton, down 28 yuan/ton. Malaysian palm oil and US soybean futures both showed a high adjustment trend, and the supporting effect of the foreign market weakened. But the futures price was relatively less vulnerable to decline under the severe impact of port cargo concentration and the inverted import cost and futures price. The trend shows that the upward pattern is still intact, but due to the lack of new momentum to push it up, the long and short funds are in a stalemate at the current price level, with a certain risk of a pullback, but the expected amplitude is not large.

The game is expected to be tested in the summer of this year. [Sina Game exclusive, please indicate the source when reprinting] Sina Game's exclusive review: Innovation concept has always been emphasized in the development of online games, but there has been no substantial progress. The Magic God's Transmission this time proposed the slogan of ""micro-innovation"", and made subtle adjustments in terms of profession setting, skill release, and client size compared to mainstream games. Whether these settings are in line with the players' habitual operation habits and experience, and whether they can meet the players' game needs, remains to be observed. Sina Games News, June 1, 2019, Sichuan Digital Publishing Media's online game company, Sky Online, announced on June 1, 2019 that it will launch a 2.5D war online game, ""The Legend of Demons,"" in the near future. The game, with micro-innovation as its concept, launches a play mode with three strong combat professions without cooldowns, no bar reading, and limited play. The game is expected to be closed beta tested in the summer vacation. It is revealed that the Heaven Online's ""God Legend"" launched this time is a 2.5D game with 3D engine, which claims to be easier for players to operate while maintaining the quality of the picture. The game emphasizes PK combat gameplay, with all skills instantly released, no cooldowns or bars, and instant recovery of potions with no delays. The game will feature camp confrontation, PK competition, clan battlefield, and national war, highlighting the combat experience. According to the official introduction, the production concept of Magic God Transmission emphasizes ""micro-innovation"". In addition to the setting of instant skill release, the game is also different from the traditional multi-profession setting. The Magic God's Legend abandoned the waste material profession and only adopted three strong combat professions - warrior, mage, and archer - to highlight the status and characteristics of each profession, without setting up a useless role. It is reported that the ""God Legend"" will launch a 100 MB client to improve the player experience. The game is expected to launch its first technical closed beta this summer.

传加护亚依签约拍AV作品昔日早安少女麻烦不断新浪娱乐讯9月30日消息，据日本八卦周刊爆料，原早安少女成员加护亚依将以5部作品一亿日元(约合835万元人民币)的价格出演AV作品。加护亚依九月中旬传出自杀未遂，有消息指自杀是因其圈外男友被捕。加护近期可谓是衰事连连。爆料该消息的《朝日艺能》周刊称，加护亚依与某家大的AV事务所签了拍摄合约，有消息指一亿日元是拍摄的预付款，也有传言称作品已经拍摄完毕，但从目前来看，如果连一部作品都还没开拍，事务所是不大可能提前支付预付款的，因此极有可能由加护亚依主演的AV作品已经拍摄完毕了。但该AV事务所在回应此事时称：“的确有这样的企划(指与加护亚依签约)，但还没有到签约的地步。”早前加护亚依同居男友因追债而犯下恐吓未遂罪被捕，几天后，传出她割腕并服用大量安眠药，所幸并未造成生命危险。关于加护亚依拍摄AV作品的消息一直都未曾断绝，去年曾传出她将和同为原早安少女成员的后藤真希拍摄AV的消息，但一直并无她的AV作品问世。加护七月份曾在推特上回应该消息时称：“怎么可能啊，笨蛋！”坚决否认了这种可能性。早安少女是日本当红组合，每一期的成员都曾有过当红时期，但近期关于原早安少女的种种负面消息却屡次见诸报端，除了加护亚依，后藤真希也是星路不顺，弟弟被捕、母亲自杀；吉泽瞳弟弟因车祸死亡；市井纱耶香离婚……麻烦不断的她们仿佛受到诅咒。（柳星张）	加护,加护亚依,亚依,后藤真希,真希,吉泽瞳,市井纱耶香,柳星张	负向	"After the former Ayai Kasukabe of the Morning Girls signed a contract to shoot AV works, Sina Entertainment News reported on September 30 that Ayai Kasukabe, a member of the Morning Girls, will shoot five AV works for 100 million yen (about 8.35 million yuan). Jia Kue Ay attempted suicide in mid-September, with reports suggesting that it was due to her boyfriend from outside the industry being arrested. Recently, Jiahu has been having a series of bad luck. The Asahi Entertainment Weekly, which broke the news, said that Ayai Kakeuchi signed a filming contract with a large AV company, and there was a rumor that one hundred million yen was the advance payment for filming, but there were also rumors that the work had already been completed. However, if no work has even been filmed, the company is unlikely to pay the advance payment in advance, so it is very likely that the AV work starring Ayai Kakeuchi has already been completed. But the AV agency responded to the matter by saying, ""There was indeed such a plan (referring to signing with Ayami Kase), but it had not yet reached the stage of signing."" Earlier, Aiy's boyfriend, who lived with her, was arrested for attempted harassment after collecting debts. A few days later, it was reported that she had cut her wrists and taken a large amount of sleeping pills, fortunately, she was not in danger of her life. There has never been a break in the news about Ayai Kaya shooting AV works. Last year, it was rumored that she would shoot AV with Aikawa Maki, a former member of the Morning Musume, but no AV works of hers have been released. Gakki also replied to this message on Twitter in July, saying, ""How could that be, you idiot!"" Refused to deny this possibility. Morning Musume is a popular Japanese group, and each member has been popular at some point. However, negative news about the original Morning Musume has been frequently reported in recent times, apart from Ayaka Kajiwara, Masaki Nishikido's career has also been unsuccessful, her brother was arrested and her mother committed suicide; Erika Yoshizawa's brother died in a car accident; Saika Shuya divorced... They seem to be cursed with endless troubles. (Liu Xing Zhang)"
上海经销商昨“拒卖诺基亚”东方早报记者周玲诺基亚回应：与“窜货商”无合同关系昨天，在上海火车站附近的地平线通信大楼内，被诺基亚公司称为“窜货商”(没有跟诺基亚签合同的三级经销商)的上海部分经销商，拉起“拒卖诺基亚”的横幅。记者获悉，此次抗议活动没有得到一家诺基亚正规经销商出面支持，显得有点势单力薄，声势不是很大。事实上，昨日的抗议横幅挂出不久后便被物业保安取下，早报记者现场也被禁止拍照，气氛紧张。一位经销商昨天对记者表示，挂出来已经是一种姿态，现在还没有完全停止销售诺基亚产品，但下一步会逐渐减少诺基亚产品销售。但一位参与抗议的经销商老板昨天对记者抱怨，济南等地的经销商抗议都得到了诺基亚正规经销商的支持，但是上海由于诺基亚施压，这些正规经销商没有一家出面力挺抗议。所谓正规经销商是指与诺基亚签订合同的代理商。按照诺基亚的渠道管理模式，一级为区域总代(简称FD)，FD下面是二级发展代理商(简称WKA)，WKA自己则会发展没有合同关系的小经销商，也被诺基亚称为“窜货商”。针对因诺基亚重罚“窜货”而引起的各地小经销商近期频繁抗议活动，诺基亚日前发布官方声明，称这些“窜货商”和诺基亚没有任何合同关系，也没有买卖关系，所以诺基亚对其罚款更无从说起。据记者了解，诺基亚窜货的罚款流程确实是直接从给当地FD的返点中扣除罚款，但FD会把罚款再转嫁给WKA，而WKA卖货给“窜货商”之前已讲清楚，如果被诺基亚抓住，罚款损失完全由窜货商承担，真正被罚的还是小经销商。一位经销商昨天对记者表示，现在每台手机赚几元钱利润，有的甚至就赚2元，再遭受巨额罚款风险太大，已经有多家经销商转卖企业品牌。相关人士昨天对记者表示，接下来各地还会有各种各样针对诺基亚的抗议活动。	周玲	负向	"Shanghai dealers refused to sell Nokia yesterday, according to the Oriental Morning Post reporter Zhou Ling. Nokia responded: it has no contractual relationship with ""speculative merchants"". Yesterday, some Shanghai dealers, who were called ""speculative merchants"" (those who did not sign contracts with Nokia) by Nokia, raised a banner saying ""refusing to sell Nokia"" in the Horizon Communication Building near Shanghai Railway Station. The reporters learned that the protest did not receive support from any official Nokia dealer, which seemed a bit weak and not very powerful. In fact, the protest banners were taken down by the property security shortly after they were hung yesterday, and the early morning reporter was also prohibited from taking photos on the scene, making the atmosphere tense. A dealer told the press yesterday that putting it up for sale was already a gesture, and that sales of Nokia products had not yet completely stopped, but that the next step would be to gradually reduce the sales of Nokia products. But a dealer boss who participated in the protest complained to the press yesterday that the dealers in Jinan and other places had received support from Nokia’s official dealers, but in Shanghai, where Nokia put pressure, not a single official dealer came out to support the protest. A formal dealer is an agent who has signed a contract with Nokia. According to Nokia's channel management model, the first level is the regional general agent (referred to as FD), and below FD is the second level development agent (referred to as WKA). WKA will then develop small dealers without contractual relationships, which Nokia also refers to as ""grey market dealers"". In response to the recent frequent protests by local small dealers against Nokia's heavy punishment for ""channel stuffing"", Nokia issued an official statement, saying that these ""channel stuffers"" have no contractual relationship with Nokia and no business relationship, so Nokia has no way to fine them. According to the information obtained by the journalist, Nokia's penalty process is indeed to deduct the penalty directly from the local FD's rebate, but the FD will pass on the penalty to WKA. And before WKA sells goods to the ""gray market dealer"", it has explained clearly that if Nokia catches it, the penalty loss will be fully borne by the gray market dealer, and the real penalty will still be borne by the small dealer. A dealer told the press yesterday that now they make a few yuan in profit per phone, and some even make only 2 yuan, and the risk of suffering huge fines is too great. Many dealers have already resold the company's brand. Those involved said yesterday that there would be more protests against Nokia in various places."
北新建材隆重推出龙牌双防石膏板新年伊始，针对华南地区潮湿环境特点，北新建材隆重推出防开裂、防下陷的龙牌双防石膏板。该石膏板采用专门研发配方，具有完美改善板材抗变形和抗下垂的性能。华南地区位于我国最南部，地处亚洲大陆东南沿海，以高温多雨为气候特点。特别是随着梅雨季节的到来，空气湿度经常高于85%。长期在潮湿环境中，一般普通石膏制品吸湿受潮后，强度降低，易产生翘曲变形。北新建材新推出的龙牌双防石膏板则弥补了以往石膏板的缺陷，以品质彰显了多重优势。首先，龙牌双防石膏板最大的一个特点是有效防开裂。一般纤维水泥类产品的干湿变形率为3%左右，而北新建材新推出的新品龙牌双防石膏板伸缩率小于0.01%，同等条件下稳定性更好；该新品同时配套龙牌专用嵌缝膏、龙牌专用嵌缝纸带共同组成龙牌防开裂系统，从板材到系统提共了全方位保障。在规范化施工应用下，可以确保不开裂。龙牌双防石膏板第二大优势就是防下陷。它是公司专门针对华南地区潮湿环境特点，并采用专门研发配方，将石膏板内部的结晶状态由原来的长针状晶体变成块状晶体，赋予板材良好的机械强度，整体强度显著提高，有效改善了板材抗变形和抗下垂的性能。成为专业打造、区域专享的最佳产品。第三，该新品防火性能更好。龙牌石膏板板材含有20%的结晶水和一定的游离水，遇火时首先是游离水蒸发，表现为释放水蒸气，吸收大量热量，抑制板材表面温度升高。当火焰温度继续升高时，分子间结晶水脱水，延缓温度上升，同时增强纤维起到加强筋作用，保持结构完好性。经专业机构检测，龙牌石膏板燃烧性能达到A2级；北新建材具有完整的防火应用体系，可满足0.5—4小时防火墙体结构。此外，该产品为绿色环保产品。北新建材通过了ISO14001环境管理体系认证及国家环境标志产品认证。龙牌双防石膏板绝不含石棉等有害物质，该新品石膏板一经推出，备受广大客户青睐。技术创新是企业持续发展的源动力，北新建材作为中国石膏板行业的开拓者，中国新型建材行业的引领者，30年来始终以技术上的创新推动着企业不断向前并实现跨越式发展。每年，公司都会斥巨资奖励在技术创新方面做出突出贡献的员工。截止2009年底，北新建材共申请专利701件，获得授权560件，自主知识产权专利技术和专利保有量多年位居全国建材行业前列。未来，公司将一如继往地“以客户为中心，创造客户价值”，为消费者提供更多的新产品和满意服务。(石新)	石新	正向	"Beijing New Materials solemnly launched the Long Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board at the beginning of the new year. In order to meet the characteristics of the humid environment in the South China region, Beijing New Materials solemnly launched the Long Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board, which can prevent cracking and sinking. The gypsum board adopts a specially developed formula, which perfectly improves the board's resistance to deformation and sagging. South China is located in the southernmost part of China, in the southeast coastal area of the Asian continent, with high temperature and abundant rainfall as its climate characteristics. Especially with the arrival of the rainy season, the air humidity is often above 85%. After a long time in a humid environment, ordinary gypsum products generally lose strength after absorbing moisture and getting damp, and are prone to warping deformation. The new Long Brand dual-proof gypsum board launched by Beixin Building Materials has made up for the shortcomings of the previous gypsum board, and demonstrated multiple advantages with its quality. First, the biggest feature of the Dragon Card double protection gypsum board is effective crack prevention. The dry-wet deformation rate of general fiber cement products is about 3%, while the new product, Long Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board, launched by Beixin Jiancail, has an expansion rate of less than 0.01%, which is more stable under the same conditions. This new product is also equipped with Long Brand Special Jointing Paste and Long Brand Special Jointing Paper Tape to form the Long Brand Anti-Crack System, providing full protection from the board to the system. Under standardized construction applications, cracking can be avoided. The second advantage of the Dragon Tile Double Protection Gypsum Board is to prevent subsidence. It is a company specifically for the characteristics of the humid environment in the south China region, and adopts a specially developed formula to change the crystalline state of the gypsum board from the original long needle-like crystals to block-like crystals, endowing the board with good mechanical strength, significantly improving the overall strength, effectively improving the board's resistance to deformation and sagging. Become the best product tailored professionally and exclusively for your region. Third, the new product has better fire protection performance. The Dragon Tile Gypsum Board contains 20% crystalline water and a certain amount of free water. When it encounters fire, the free water evaporates first, which manifests as the release of water vapor and the absorption of a large amount of heat, inhibiting the increase in the surface temperature of the board. As the flame temperature continues to rise, the crystalline water between the molecules dehydrates, delaying the temperature rise, while reinforcing the fibers to act as a strengthening skeleton, maintaining the structural integrity. After professional testing, the burning performance of Long牌gypsum board has reached level A2. North New Materials has a complete fire protection application system, which can meet the fireproof wall structure requirements of 0.5-4 hours. In addition, the product is an environmentally friendly product. Beijing New Materials has passed the ISO14001 environmental management system certification and the national environmental mark product certification. The Dragon Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board does not contain harmful substances such as asbestos, and the new gypsum board has been favored by a wide range of customers since its launch. Technological innovation is the source of power for the continuous development of enterprises. As the pioneer of the gypsum board industry in China and the leader of the new building materials industry, Binhai New Materials has always been driving the enterprise to move forward and achieve leapfrog development through technological innovation. Every year, the company spends a lot of money to reward employees who have made outstanding contributions to technological innovation. By the end of 2009, Beixin Building Materials had applied for 701 patents, of which 560 were authorized, and its independent intellectual property patents and patent holdings have been among the top in the national building materials industry for many years. In the future, the company will continue to ""customer-centric, create customer value"" and provide more new products and satisfactory services to consumers. (Shi Xin)"

With the gradual release of the semi-annual reports of listed companies, the hidden heavyweights of the China Resources Broad Selection Fund and the China Resources Strategy Selection Fund, which were increased or bought in the second quarter by the famous fund manager, Wang Yawei, have also been revealed. Wang Yawei continued to follow his unique stock selection logic, and Hua Xia Dashuju and Hua Xia Strategy often appeared as a pair in the top ten circulating shareholders of many listed companies. According to the statistics of Tianxiang Investment, as of August 5, nine listed companies had Wang Yawei's management of Hua Xia大盘or Hua Xia Strategy in the top ten circulating shareholders, except for Zhongheng Group and Zhonghang Real Estate, the other seven were newly entered stocks in the second quarter. Among them, Wang Yawei's得意之作was entering Xinjiang Casting, and the semi-annual report of Xinjiang Casting showed that Huaxia Dividend Selection held nearly 8 million shares of the stock, ranking as the eighth largest circulating shareholder. At the end of the first quarter, Huaxia Dividend Selection did not enter the top ten circulating shareholders of the stock, and Huaxia Dividend Selection did not hold the stock at the beginning of this year and at the end of last year. Clearly, Wang Yawei made a large-scale intervention in Xinjiang Casting in the second quarter. And Chongqing Foundry has surged by 61.93% since July, while Hua Xia Selected has made substantial profits in a short period of time. International sugar prices have recently performed impressively, continuously creating new highs in rebound. Wang Yawei had a prescient insight and intervened in the sugar industry listed company Guizhou Sugar early in the second quarter. The semi-annual report of Guitan Corporation shows that among the top ten circulating shareholders at the end of the second quarter, four are public funds, all of which are Huaxia series funds. Among them, Huaxia Select and Huaxia Strategy are the fourth largest circulating shareholders with 3 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively. Huaxia Industry and Huaxia Dividend are the second and fifth largest circulating shareholders with 8.5 million and nearly 2 million shares, respectively. While Gu Tang's top ten circulating shareholders in the first quarter report only had one fund shareholder, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's selected fund, which shows that the four funds of the Huaxia series collectively intervened in Gu Tang's shares in the second quarter. Boosted by the sharp rise in sugar prices, Guishang Sugar, which performed poorly in the second quarter, has risen by 32.8% since July. The second quarter report of the fund shows that China Resources Selected in the second quarter made a large-scale increase in holdings of China Petrochemical and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical, two petrochemical stocks, and another obscure petrochemical stock Daqing Huake was also visited by China Resources Selected. Daqing Huakuo's semi-annual report shows that at the end of the second quarter, Wang Yawei's two funds, Huaxia Selected and Huaxia Strategy, held 1.93 million and 1.2 million shares of Daqing Huakuo respectively, entering its top ten circulating shareholders for the first time, and they are the only fund shareholders among its top ten circulating shareholders. In addition to Daqing Huakuo, Huaxia Selection and Huaxia Strategy, two brother funds, also appeared in the top ten circulating shareholders of Lijiang Tourism, with Huaxia Dividend Payout holding nearly 2 million shares, ranking as the second largest circulating shareholder, and Huaxia Strategy holding 600,000 shares, ranking as the fifth largest circulating shareholder. The Changsheng Tongqing, which bought 1.19 million shares and ranked as the third largest circulating shareholder, was established with a fund of one billion yuan on May 12. And Huabao Industry Select, which entered the top ten circulating shareholders of Lijiang tourism at the end of the first quarter, reduced its holdings in the second quarter and disappeared from the top ten shareholders. In the second quarter, the Huaxia series funds made a large purchase or increase in Yudafang, and seven Huaxia series funds, including Huaxia Dashan Selection and Huaxia Strategy, entered the top ten circulating shareholders of Yudafang at the end of the second quarter, among which Huaxia Dashan Selection and Huaxia Strategy held 4.02 million shares and 1.99 million shares respectively, ranking as the third and eighth largest circulating shareholders. Although YuFazhan saw a 53.01% increase in the second quarter, its performance has been poor since July, with only a 6.41% increase. And Hua Xia's selected shares of Hangzhou Jiabei only rose 14.74% since July, lagging behind the market.
对话奥沙利文：百米成绩9秒6斯诺克完美境界是什么本报记者李婷体坛：说到你的孩子，每次在外比赛会特别想他们吧？奥沙利文：那当然，他们就是我的心肝呀，我只要一离开家就会特别想念他们，不过他们现在还太小，女儿三岁，儿子只有一岁半，可能还不太能理解我的心情。体坛：那为什么不把孩子一起带来？奥沙利文：其实我向组委会方面申请过，但组委会没有同意。我后来想想，自己是来比赛的，所以安心一点也好。体坛：16岁时父亲入狱，让你失去了很多父爱，会不会让你希望给孩子更多父爱？奥沙利文：孩子的成长需要父母给予很多关怀和帮助，所以只要我有时间都会在家陪他们，不要以为我会很忙，其实我每天只练两三个小时的球，然后腾出更多时间给家人。不过他们现在还太小，不能一起玩，我最多和儿子踢足球。体坛：：听说你父亲前一段曾短暂出狱，能谈谈他吗？奥沙利文：他是个很积极的人，不管面对什么情况，都不会消沉，我想这是他影响我最大的一点。他一直很关注也很支持我，即便我们不能见面，他也会了解我的比赛情况，我们彼此并不会因为距离而疏远。过去我们只能通过电话或几个月才能见一次，我相信不久的将来我们又能重新在一起。体坛：听说你酷爱跑步也是受了父亲的影响？奥沙利文：小时候父亲每天都会跑步，我也跟着，后来我自己每天都跑10公里，现在我基本上每周跑六天，可以放松身心，也可以保持不错的精神状态，再有就是保持体型。我现在年纪大了，不跑肚子上会长肉的，(大笑)要不要给你秀一下我的腹肌？体坛：每周六天，那你不怕风吹日晒雨淋？奥沙利文：风雨还是挺怕，但太阳是我的最爱呀，你看我皮肤，怎么样？很光滑吧？告诉你，我用的就是“阳光牌”润肤霜，推荐给你。还是要多晒晒太阳啦，我们平时打斯诺克不见天日，跑步总算能让我沐浴阳光，当然得享受。体坛：百米成绩怎么样？最远一次又是跑了多远？奥沙利文：我百米成绩是9秒6哦，很快吧，(笑)我开玩笑啦，我百米差不多14秒，有点不好意思啊。最远我跑过一次25公里，应该是半程马拉松的距离了，用了一个半小时，平常10公里我最快纪录是34分钟。体坛：看你挺重视身材和形象，我知道你是个追求完美的人。奥沙利文：是的，完美状态，是我最希望达到的，我总会以这种要求来提醒自己，我知道这很难，所以我会下很大决心来面对。体坛：怎么理解完美？斯诺克中的完美是？奥沙利文：完美就是你从来不可能达到完美的境界，但你可以做到保持连续性的高水平。这适应于所有方面。不论你在哪方面持续达到高水平，你都是那方面具有支配地位的人。斯诺克中的完美一定是147分。当然，你不可能每次比赛都能获得147分，就像我刚才说的，完美本身是不存在的，而是一个不断追求的过程。我也不是完美的人，但我会以这个标准来要求自己。体坛：所以你经常开局打得不好，就容易放弃之后的比赛？奥沙利文：我的确想把每场球都打得完美，如果开局不顺，我就会觉得即使后面打得再好，赢下来，过程也不是我想要的，这会让我失去对比赛的兴趣，不过也不是经常吧，只是偶尔为之。体坛：我记得你这“偶尔”的一次发生在2006年英锦赛你与亨得利的比赛中。奥沙利文：哦，你还记得真清楚，我当时1比4落后，觉得没什么希望，与其打下去还不如早点结束，反正结果也能预见，我打完那局就放弃离开了。我也因此付出了代价，罚钱又扣分，也算是个经验教训，现在我应该是不会了。体坛：你知道，为了斯诺克的发展，国际台联做了很多改革，但效果都不太好。奥沙利文：我知道斯诺克的商业发展不顺利，但具体的，我不懂。这些和我也没太大关系，我不是沃克爵士，我只管打好自己的球。如果我是沃克爵士？哦，不，不可能的，我只是奥沙利文，只做奥沙利文该做的。体坛：那你能给斯诺克运动的发展一些建议吗？奥沙利文：那你付我咨询费吗？(笑)不过看在你送我礼物的份上，我可以免收你的咨询费，其实我的收费挺高的。不过说真的，这项运动的发展不是我能控制的。体坛：沃克爵士曾说会考虑将世锦赛搬到中国，你愿意在英国之外参加如此重大的比赛吗？奥沙利文：其实在哪都一样，只是看心情上能否适应。即便真是那样，我肯定会让自己适应的，别忘了，奥沙利文是追求完美的，就像你说的那样。体坛：你认为你为斯诺克带来了什么？奥沙利文：速度？激情？147？我喜欢人们在看斯诺克，谈论到球手时会说，“哦，那是奥沙利文，我最喜欢的球手，他能打147分。”我在这项运动中是顶尖的，这能引起关注，吸引大家关注斯诺克。体坛：年轻人想达到奥沙利文的成就，应该怎么做？奥沙利文：他们应该要学习很多高手。我建议他们多看亨得利、戴维斯这些选手的技术录像，多练习，要专注。我也是在学习其他高手的过程中成为今天的奥沙利文，我以前经常会把亨得利的比赛录下来反复看，反复学。体坛：中国现在有很多学斯诺克的小孩，他们都是退学来专门投身这项运动。奥沙利文：这样？我认为教育是很重要的。当然，如果一个孩子确实对任何事都没兴趣，只喜欢斯诺克，那只要他愿意，也可以一直练习。但此外，还是必须接触其他知识，这是平衡，必须要处理好。体坛：说说现在的经济危机吧，你在英国有什么感受？奥沙利文：是的，全球现在都在经历危机，英国应该比中国更严重，其实我觉得没必要太担心，想着经济危机会怎样，这也是世界发展的自然规律吧，就像人也会生病。关键是，经济危机就算带走我们的一些金钱，但带不走我们的精神，只要有信念，一切都会过去。体坛：你在伦敦也有些生意，经济危机有影响吗？奥沙利文：我做一些地产还有店铺，这方面我倒没有特别留意，影响肯定有，但还不算大。我唯一的“生意”还是斯诺克，没比赛的时候，我才会关心一下其他产业。体坛：你觉得在哪更受欢迎，中国还是英国？奥沙利文：英国，毕竟斯诺克在英国有很悠久的历史，很多人喜欢斯诺克，也懂斯诺克，而在中国，虽然也有很多球迷问我要签名合影，但我不知道他们怎么看待斯诺克，因为我没法和他们交流。体坛：你到过北京、上海，还去了别的中国城市，最喜欢哪里？奥沙利文：中国每个城市给人的感觉都不一样。上海很时髦，现在是国际大都市，我喜欢那里的建筑，很多元化。南京环境很不错。而北京是个迷人的地方，有太多惊奇，我想夏天时带孩子来看看。体坛：每次到北京，有特别想去的地方吗？奥沙利文：餐馆，那是我一定要去的。喜欢中国菜？哦不，我不是喜欢，我是热爱，我太热爱了！我每次来北京都会去酒店附近一些粤菜馆吃海鲜，我在家也会做海鲜给孩子们吃。不过要说最喜欢的，还是广州的早茶，每次去广州，我都会吃很多样的茶点，太精致了。说到这，到了午餐时间，奥沙利文喝完咖啡说：“昨晚我去附近一家粤菜餐厅，那里的清蒸鱼很好吃，我等会儿还要再来一条。”奥沙利文笑着准备回房间，刚走了两步，又扭头回来：“哦，我的好运小牛忘拿了，不知道它会不会助我拿到比赛的冠军？”	奥沙利文,斯诺克,李婷,亨得利,沃克,戴维斯	正向	"Interview with O'Sullivan: 100-meter results are 9.6 seconds. What is the perfect境界of snooker? Li Ting, reporter, Sports World: When you talk about your children, do you miss them very much every time you are away for a competition? O'Sullivan: Of course, they are my heart and soul, I miss them very much as soon as I leave home, but they are still too young, the daughter is three years old, the son is only one and a half years old, they may not understand my feelings very well. Sports: Why not bring the children too? O'Sullivan: I actually applied to the organizing committee, but the organizing committee did not agree. I thought to myself that I was here to compete, so it would be better to be more at ease. Sports: At 16, your father went to prison, which deprived you of a lot of paternal love. Will this make you want to give your child more paternal love? O'Sullivan: The growth of children needs a lot of care and help from parents, so as long as I have time, I will stay at home with them. Don't think I am very busy, in fact, I only practice for two or three hours of the ball every day, and then leave more time for the family. But they are still too young to play together, and I can only play football with my son. Sports: I heard that your father was briefly released from prison recently. Can you talk about him? O'Sullivan: He is a very positive person, no matter what situation he faces, he will not be depressed, I think this is the biggest influence on me. He has always been concerned about and supported me, even if we cannot meet, he will understand my competition situation, and we will not be estranged due to distance. In the past, we could only communicate by phone or meet once every few months, and I believe that in the near future, we will be able to reunite again. Sports: I heard that you love running, which is also influenced by your father? O'Sullivan: My father would run every day when I was young, and I followed him. Later, I run 10 kilometers every day by myself. Now I basically run six days a week, which can relax my mind and body, maintain a good mental state, and keep fit. Now that I am old, I will gain fat on my belly, not muscle. (laugh) Do you want me to show you my abs? Sports field: six days a week, don't you fear the wind, the sun, the rain and the dew? O'Sullivan: I'm a bit afraid of the rain and wind, but the sun is my favorite. Look at my skin, how is it? It's very smooth, isn't it? Tell you, I use the ""Sunshine brand"" moisturizing cream, recommend it to you. We still need to get more sun exposure. We don't see the sun when we play snooker every day, but running allows me to bask in the sun, of course, I have to enjoy it. Sports field: How is your 100 meters? How far was the farthest one? O'Sullivan: My 100 meters is 9.6 seconds, very fast, (laugh) I'm joking, my 100 meters is about 14 seconds, a little embarrassed. The farthest I have run is 25 kilometers, which should be the distance of a half marathon, and it took me one and a half hours. My fastest record for 10 kilometers is 34 minutes. Sports: I see you are very concerned about your figure and appearance. I know you are a perfectionist. O'Sullivan: Yes, perfect form, that's what I always aim for, and I always remind myself to do so, I know it's very difficult, so I will make a great effort to face it. Sports: How to understand perfection? What is perfection in snooker? O'Sullivan: Perfect is that you can never reach the perfect realm, but you can maintain a high level of continuity. This applies to all aspects. No matter how high you consistently achieve in any aspect, you are the dominant person in that aspect. The perfect score in snooker is 147 points. Of course, you can't get 147 points in every match, as I said just now, perfection itself does not exist, but it is a process of continuous pursuit. I am not a perfect person either, but I will demand this standard of myself. In the sports world, so you often give up the rest of the game after playing poorly at the beginning? O'Sullivan: I do want to play every match perfectly, if the start is not good, I will feel that even if I play well later, winning the game, the process is not what I want, this will make me lose interest in the game, but not often, just occasionally. Sports: I remember that this ""occasional"" happened in your match with Hendry in the British Championship in 2006. O'Sullivan: Oh, you remember it very clearly. At that time, I was 1-4 behind, and I felt there was no hope. It was better to end it early rather than continue, anyway, the result could be foreseen. I gave up and left after finishing that game. I also paid a price for it, was fined and deducted points, which can be considered a lesson, and now I should not do it anymore. Sports: You know, for the development of snooker, the IPT has made many reforms, but the results were not very good. O'Sullivan: I know that snooker's commercial development is not going well, but the specifics, I don't understand. This has nothing to do with me. I am not Sir Walker. I only care about playing my own game well. If I were Sir Walks? Oh, no, it's impossible, I'm just Ronnie O'Sullivan, just doing what Ronnie O'Sullivan should do. Sports: Can you give some advice for the development of snooker? O'Sullivan: Then you pay me for consulting fees? (Smiling) Anyway, considering the gift you gave me, I can waive your consultation fee. Actually, my fee is quite high. To be honest, the development of this sport is not in my control. In the sports world, Sir Walker once said that he would consider moving the World Championship to China. Would you be willing to participate in such a major competition outside of the UK? O'Sullivan: It's the same everywhere, it's just a matter of whether you can adapt to the mood. Even if that were the case, I would definitely adapt, don't forget, Ronnie is perfectionist, as you said. Sports: What do you think you have brought to snooker? O'Sullivan: Speed? Passion? 147? I like it when people talk about the players while watching snooker and say, ""Oh, that's O'Sullivan, my favorite player, he can get 147."" I am at the top of this sport, which can attract attention and attract people to pay attention to snooker. Sports: How can young people achieve the achievements of O'Sullivan? O'Sullivan: They should learn a lot from the masters. I suggest that they watch more videos of players like Hendry and Davis, practice more, and focus. I became the current O'Sullivan by learning from other masters in the process, I used to often record Hendry's matches and watch and learn repeatedly. Sports: There are now many children in China who learn snooker, and they all drop out of school to devote themselves to this sport. O'Sullivan: Like this? I think education is very important. Of course, if a child is really not interested in anything else and only likes snooker, he can continue to practice as long as he wishes. But in addition, it is necessary to come into contact with other knowledge, which is a balance that must be handled well. Sports: Talk about the current economic crisis, what do you feel in the UK? O'Sullivan: Yes, the whole world is now experiencing a crisis, and the UK should be more serious than China. In fact, I don't think we need to be too worried, thinking about how the economic crisis will be, this is also the natural law of the development of the world, just like people will also get sick. The key is that even if the economic crisis takes away some of our money, it cannot take away our spirit. As long as we have faith, everything will pass. Sports: You have some business in London as well. Has the economic crisis had an impact? O'Sullivan: I do some property and shops, but I don't pay much attention to it. There is certainly an impact, but it's not huge. My only ""business"" is snooker, and I only care about other industries when there is no competition. Sports field: Do you think you are more popular in China or in the UK? O'Sullivan: Britain, after all, snooker has a long history in Britain, many people like snooker and understand snooker, but in China, although there are also many fans asking me for autographs and photos, but I don't know how they think of snooker, because I can't communicate with them. Sports field: Have you been to Beijing and Shanghai, and have you been to other Chinese cities? Which one do you like best? O'Sullivan: Each city in China gives a different feeling. Shanghai is very fashionable, now it is an international metropolis, I like the buildings there, very diversified. Nanjing has a very nice environment. And Beijing is a fascinating place with too many surprises, I want to bring my children to see it in summer. Sports field: Is there a special place you want to go every time you come to Beijing? O'Sullivan: Restaurant, that's one I have to go to. Do you like Chinese food? Oh no, I don't like it, I love it, I love it so much! Every time I come to Beijing, I go to some Cantonese restaurants near the hotel to eat seafood, and I also cook seafood for my children at home. But speaking of my favorite, it's the dim sum in Guangzhou. Every time I go to Guangzhou, I will eat a lot of dim sum, which is too exquisite. At this point, it was lunchtime, and O'Sullivan said after drinking coffee, ""Last night I went to a Cantonese restaurant nearby, and the steamed fish was very delicious, and I will have another one later."" O'Sullivan smiled as he prepared to return to his room, and took two steps before turning back. ""Oh, my lucky calf, I forgot to take it. I wonder if it will help me win the championship?"" """

纽约政府停购瓶装水【新华社北京5月6日电】为节省开支和遏制全球变暖，美国纽约州政府5日发布行政命令，所有州政府机构办公室将不再购买瓶装水供工作人员饮用。据美联社报道，纽约州州长戴维·帕特森在新闻发布会上指出：“纳税人已花了几十亿美元以确保我们的洁净饮用水供应。我们投入如此巨资，就当受其惠和用其水。”州长办公室列举数据说，美国每年生产塑料水瓶要消耗1700万桶石油，排放250万多吨二氧化碳。至于新措施能节省多少公款，州长办公室表示，由于州府各部门一直各自买水，一时还不能马上统计清楚。	戴维·帕特森	正向	New York State Government Will Stop Buying Bottled Water [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 6] In order to save money and curb global warming, the New York State Government issued an administrative order on May 5, stating that all state government offices will no longer purchase bottled water for staff to drink. According to the Associated Press, New York State Governor David Paterson pointed out at a press conference that taxpayers have spent billions of dollars to ensure our clean water supply. We invested so much, and we will enjoy its benefits and use its water. The governor’s office cited data that the United States consumes 17 million barrels of oil and emits more than 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually to produce plastic water bottles. As to how much public funds the new measures can save, the governor's office said that it was too early to make a clear count, as the departments of the state government have been buying water separately.

德国司机驾着达拉斯的梦宿命对决小牛浴火待重生新浪体育讯　2007年的暑假，德克-诺维茨基从法兰克福出发，经由迪拜，去往澳洲，62岁的导师霍尔格-格施温德尔是他唯一的旅伴。大堡礁、墨尔本、阿德莱德，他们租了辆车，五周的时间几乎跑遍整个澳洲。等到再度回到德国的时候，德克已经是满脸大胡子的野人了。这是一次心灵之旅，用德克的话，是去寻找“生命的真谛”。他需要忘记MVP的个人荣耀与小牛遭遇黑八耻辱之间的必然关联。“对我来说最艰难的是，这个MVP永远都将和小牛首轮被淘汰联系在一起，人们会说诺维茨基获奖名不符实……当我回想上赛季的时候，我想的不是MVP，而是季后赛失利，输球永远是我无法释怀的事情。”永远无法释怀的又何止是他一个人，可也正是这一次的旅行，教会了他如何去释怀。因为，放下，才能到达更远的前方。从2007年往前，他在这个联盟征战9年，他是公认的全联盟最好的五名球员之一，是新科MVP，带领小牛打出了67胜15负的绝佳战绩。可这一切又有什么用呢？这一切的荣耀在黑八面前轰然坍塌，一地的荒凉。或者，其实，命运的轮盘早就开启，在06年总决赛的一败涂地，在罚丢那该死的罚球的时候，就开启了。在南半球的丛林中，诺维茨基想过：“我在哪里？要去向何方？一个人的努力是否注定无法抗衡强大的命运？”此去经年，四年以后的今天，他重新站上总决赛的舞台，终于可以不再那么急促的呼吸，仔细的回想达拉斯这12年的前世今生。98年，老尼尔森将他从密尔沃基带到了达拉斯。熟悉他的人都会记得那张照片，干瘦干瘦的他，与同样干瘦干瘦的史蒂夫-纳什，梳着同样搞笑的发型，举起了达拉斯白色的球衣。刚满二十岁，稚嫩的不仅仅是球技，他无助彷徨却又警惕谨慎的面对这个陌生的世界。1999到2000赛季，打满82场，81场首发，老尼尔森给了他足够的信任，他用场均翻番的得分来回报。从2000到01赛季开始，小牛开始连续的杀入季后赛，而德克和纳什入选全明星，也昭示着达拉斯的崛起指日可待。梦在2004年第一次出现裂痕，止步季后赛首轮之后，纳什离开了球馆，却再也没有回来。宿命，当德克在2005年的5月，在西部半决赛中遭遇纳什所在的太阳的时候，他第一次开始相信这个词的存在。姚明第一次在球场上遭遇变成对手的弗朗西斯的时候主动请战，他说，只有打败他我才能真正的放下。德克也一样，宿命将他逼到绝境，他需要做的就是打破它！只可惜，这一年，他目送纳什和他的菲尼克斯太阳昂首迈进西部决赛，小牛再一次的打道回府。时光就这样来到了2006年的初夏，纳什和芬利的离开逐渐不再是心里的伤，愈合的伤疤成为坚守的理由，相望天涯也要为彼此赢下些什么。4比0横扫灰熊，7场大战击败马刺，西部决赛，他与纳什再相逢。前四场打成2比2，各丢一个主场。重回达拉斯，德克交出了50分，53.8%的命中率，94.4%的罚球命中率，83.3%的三分球命中率的成绩单，小牛末节打出35比20的攻击潮，一举拿下赛点。4比2，德克与纳什挥别，也与桎梏了他一整年的宿命挥别，踏上全新的舞台。那一年他28岁，最最黄金的年纪。那一年，他的身边有杰森-特里。连下两城，无限风光就在眼前，该死的宿命却在第三场再度搅局。前三节，一切都按照小牛设想的那样发展着，77-68，小牛领先9分，然而最后一节，韦德带领热火上演大翻盘。全场比赛还有9.3秒，佩顿远投中的为热火反超比分。德克进攻造犯规，可是，他最引以自豪的罚球害了他。两罚一中，韦德抢下篮板，小牛只能犯规，将胜利拱手相让。就像2005年输给太阳一样，德克低估了心理崩塌的破坏力，连输4场，让对手在自己的主场捧杯。2007年，67胜15负，联盟最佳战绩，常规赛MVP，诺维茨基却未曾想见站在自己对面的仍旧是打不破的宿命——曾经的恩师老尼尔森。金州人在老尼尔森的调教下成为真正的勇士，4比2将领头羊小牛在首轮就送回了家。如果说，总决赛的失败多少带着些安慰的话，黑八将诺维茨基彻底的打进了深渊，万劫不复。他想不明白，更弄不懂，是什么让自己走到今天的境地。明明尽了力，明明是至高无上的荣耀，却为何都变成了耻辱？软弱、伪领袖、永远悲情的配角，这一个个标签无情的贴上，就再难撕下。那时候，就连特里，也都不理解他，哪怕他们身边的人已经一个个走散在天涯。送走德文-哈里斯，迎来基德，到底是对是错？历史从来不是一天写成，一笔交易的成败也需要时间来验证。至少在2007-2008赛季，小牛被证明是失败的，面对新生代明星克里斯-保罗，基德没能给小牛带来奇迹，还是首轮游。08-09赛季，卡莱尔接过教鞭，这个被球迷亲昵的称为“金-凯瑞”的教练与小将军约翰逊是完全两个风格的。他更加的儒雅，更加的不动声色。可他沉静如水的底下是对诺维茨基坚定不移的信任。4比1击败马刺，半决赛输给掘金，这时候的西部已经不再是当年的西部了。无论是湖人、掘金还是新贵黄蜂，哪一个与小牛相比都要豪华的多，都要强悍的多。又是55胜27负，09-10赛季常规赛让小牛有足够的资本，西南赛区的头名，可还是败在了马刺的脚下。又是一笔血债，只是这一次，不知道什么时候开始的，诺维茨基的身上，整个小牛的身上，多了一份淡然。这是潜移默化的形成，这是气质的蜕变。从穿上小牛的球衣到今天，整整13年，从离开纳什开始一个人走自己的路，也已经7年。这些年是被泪水浸湿的，是被一次次从云端推落的，也是德克一口口咽下宿命苦涩的过程。我曾怀疑我走在沙漠中从不结果无论种什么梦才张开翅膀风却便沉默习惯伤痛能不能算收获可是，你要相信，只有阳光没有阴影，只有欢乐没有痛苦，这绝不是人生的常态。风平浪静造就不出坚韧不拔的水手。梦做过可能就会被忘记，可诺维茨基这个梦，是铭刻在心里的，又怎么能忘。首轮淘汰开拓者还有些步履蹒跚，西部半决赛横扫湖人更多的是让人们见识了小牛整个纵队的深度。雷霆，给小牛制造了最多麻烦的球队，也给了德克最多的机会来证明自己。24罚全中的神迹，连续两场的关键球，晋级的关键三分……他开始承担起一个真正领袖该有的担当，不是场场50+，不是一己之力拖着球队前行。他学会更多的传球，他坚持克制自己，谨慎的出手，他成全队友，换来队友对自己的成全。最重要的，在生死的那一刻，在队友信任的将球交到他手上的时候，他的眼底，没有彷徨，没有犹豫，那是一片澄澈的天空，可以任由梦想翱翔。所以，命运将热火再一次的，适时的送到他的面前。为自己正名，他有真正的宿命要打破。五年前，溺毙在漫天的热火中，五年后，他要浴火重生！庆幸的是我一直没回头终于发现真的是有绿洲每把汗流了生命变的厚重走出沮丧才看见新宇宙海阔天空在勇敢以后要拿执着将命运的锁打破冷漠的人谢谢你们曾经看轻我让我不低头更精彩的活你从来不是在跟什么人争，不是在跟一支球队争，你真正的敌人一直是你自己。2011年的6月，这个来自德国的司机，驾驶着达拉斯的梦，终究迎来了与命运再搏一把的机会。热火不再是曾经的热火，小牛也不再是曾经的小牛，诺维茨基更不再是曾经的那个德克，他始终心存愧疚，他要用铮铮铁骨，置身热火熔炉，百炼成钢！(暖暖)	德克-诺维茨基,德克,诺维茨基,霍尔格-格施温德尔,老尼尔森,尼尔森,史蒂夫-纳什,纳什,姚明,弗朗西斯,芬利,杰森-特里,特里,韦德,佩顿,德文-哈里斯,基德,克里斯-保罗,卡莱尔,金-凯瑞,约翰逊,暖暖	正向	"German drivers, Dallas' dream, destiny, showdown, the rebirth of the little bull, Sina Sports News. In the summer vacation of 2007, Dirk Nowitzki, from Frankfurt, via Dubai, to Australia, 62-year-old mentor Holger Geschwindner was his only travel companion. The Great Barrier Reef, Melbourne, Adelaide, they rented a car and ran almost the whole of Australia in five weeks. When Dirk returned to Germany again, he was a wild man with a full beard. It was a journey of the soul, as Dirk put it, to seek the ""essence of life."" He needs to forget the inevitable connection between his MVP individual glory and the Mavericks' eighth-game elimination humiliation. What was most difficult for me was that this MVP would always be associated with the Mavericks' first-round elimination, and people would say that Nowitzki's award was a case of name and reality not matching. When I think back to last season, I don't think of the MVP, but the playoff failure, and losing is something I can never get over. It is not only him who can never let go, but it is also this trip that taught him how to let go. For, letting go enables us to reach a farther distance. Before 2007, he had played for the league for 9 years, and he was one of the five best players in the league, the new MVP, leading the Mavericks to a record of 67 wins and 15 losses. So what does it matter? All the glory collapsed in the face of the eighth black, leaving a desolate scene. Or, in fact, the wheel of fate was already set in motion in the 2006 Finals, when they were thoroughly defeated and missed those damned free throws. In the jungle of the southern hemisphere, Nowitzki thought, ""Where am I?"" Where are we going? Is one person's effort destined to be powerless against a powerful fate? Years later, four years from now, he will stand on the stage of the final again, finally able to breathe more calmly, and carefully recall the past and present of these 12 years in Dallas. In 1998, Nelson brought him from Milwaukee to Dallas. Those who know him well will remember the photo, with him, thin and thin, holding up the white Dallas jersey, with Steve Nash, also thin and thin, combing the same funny hairstyle. At just twenty years old, his inexperience was not limited to his ball skills; he faced the unfamiliar world helplessly and hesitantly, yet with vigilance. In the 1999-2000 season, he started in 81 games and played all 82 games. With enough trust from the old Neilson, he returned with a doubled average score. Since the 2000-01 season, the Mavericks have been making consecutive playoff appearances, and Dirk and Nash's selection to the All-Star team also heralded the imminent rise of Dallas. The dream began to show cracks in 2004, after Nash left the arena following the first round of the playoffs and never returned. Destiny, when Dirk encountered Nash's Suns in the Western Conference Semifinals in May 2005, he began to believe in the existence of the word for the first time. Yao Ming volunteered to play against Francis, his opponent, for the first time on the court, saying that he could only put down his heart after defeating him. Dec also, his fate forced him to a dead end, all he needed to do was break it! Unfortunately, that year, he watched Nash and his Phoenix Suns march into the Western Conference Finals, while the Mavericks went home again. The time has come to the early summer of 2006, Nash and Finley's departure is no longer a wound in the heart, the healed scar becomes the reason to hold on, even if we are far apart, we still need to win something for each other. They swept the Grizzlies 4-0, defeated the Spurs in seven games in the Western Conference Finals, and met Nash again in the Western Conference Finals. The first four games were tied 2-2, with each team losing one home game. Back in Dallas, Dirk scored 50 points, shooting 53.8% from the field, 94.4% from the free-throw line, and 83.3% from beyond the arc. The Mavericks scored 35-20 in the fourth quarter and took the lead. 4-2, Dirk and Nash bid farewell to each other, and also bid farewell to the fate that shackled him for the whole year, stepping onto a new stage. That year, he was 28, the most golden age of his life. That year, he had Jason Terry by his side. Two consecutive victories, and the beautiful scenery was just ahead, but the damned destiny once again disrupted the third game. The first three quarters went as the Mavericks had planned, with the Mavericks leading by 9 points, 77-68. However, in the final quarter, Wade led the Heat to a comeback. With 9.3 seconds left in the game, Peay made a three-pointer to give the Heat the lead. DeKok scored by drawing a foul, but, ironically, his best shot was his downfall. Two free throws, Wade grabs the rebound, the Mavericks have to foul, and hand over the victory. Like in 2005 when they lost to the Suns, Dirk under-estimated the power of a mental collapse, losing four straight and allowing the opponent to hoist the trophy in his own arena. In 2007, with 67 wins and 15 losses, the best record in the league, and the regular season MVP, Nowitzki still did not expect that his opponent would be the coach who could not be broken - his former coach, Neilson. The Golden State Warriors became a real champion under the coaching of Neil, and they sent the leader Mavericks back home with a 4-2 in the first round. If the failure in the finals was somewhat comforting, the eighth seed completely pushed Nowitzki into the abyss, from which there was no return. He could not understand, and he did not understand, what had led him to this situation. Why did all of it turn into shame, even though one had done one's best and it was the supreme honor? Weak, fake leaders, and eternal tragic side characters, these labels are无情地贴上, and it is hard to remove them. Back then, Terry did not understand him either, even though everyone around them had long dispersed to the ends of the earth. Was was it right or wrong to send Devin-Harris and welcome Kidd? History is never written in a day, and the success or failure of a transaction also needs time to be verified. At least through the 2007-2008 season, the Mavericks were a disappointment, and Kidd was unable to bring them a miracle against the young star Chris Paul, who still lost in the first round. In the 08-09 season, Carles took over the coaching, and this coach, who is affectionately called ""Golden Karry"", is completely different from General Johnson. He is more refined and more unemotional. But beneath his calm exterior lies unwavering trust in Nowitzki. Beat the Spurs 4-1, lost to the Nuggets in the semifinals, by this time, the West was no longer the West of old. Compared with the Lakers, the Nuggets, or the new Hornets, the Mavericks are much more luxurious and much stronger. Another 55-27 record, and the regular season of the 09-10 season gave the Mavericks enough capital to be the top seed in the Southwest Division, but they still lost to the Spurs. Another blood debt, and this time, without knowing when it started, Nowitzki and the entire Mavericks had a touch of indifference. It is formed imperceptibly, a metamorphosis of temperament. From the time I put on the Mavericks' jersey to today, it has been 13 years, and it has been 7 years since I left Nash and started walking my own path. These years were soaked in tears, pushed down from the clouds again and again, and also the process in which Dirk swallowed the bitterness of fate mouth by mouth. I once doubted that I walked in the desert and never bore fruit no matter what dream spread its wings and the wind was silent. Can the habit of pain be considered a harvest? But you must believe that there is only sunshine and no shadow, only joy and no pain, and this is not the norm of life. Smooth seas do not make skilled sailors. Dreams may be forgotten, but Novak's dream is engraved in his heart, how can he forget it. The first round of elimination of the Trail Blazers was still somewhat hesitant, and the sweep of the Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals more often than not made people see the depth of the entire Mavericks team. The Thunder, who caused the most trouble for the Mavericks, also gave Dirk the most opportunities to prove himself. A miracle of 24 successful free throws, key shots in consecutive two games, a decisive three-pointer for advancement... He began to shoulder the responsibility of a true leader, not scoring 50+ points every game, not dragging the team forward with his own efforts. He learned to pass more, he persisted in restraining himself, being cautious with his shots, and he fulfilled his teammates, in exchange for his teammates' fulfillment of him. Most importantly, at the moment of life and death, when his teammate trusts him to pass the ball to him, there is no hesitation, no hesitation in his eyes. It is a clear sky, where dreams can soar freely. So, fate once again brought the Heat to him at the right time. To clear his name, he has a real destiny to break. Five years ago, he drowned in the scorching flames, and five years later, he will be reborn from the flames! Fortunately, I never turned back and finally found that there really is an oasis. Every drop of sweat makes life heavier. Only after walking out of depression did I see the new universe, vast and boundless. After being brave, I will use perseverance to break the lock of fate. Thank you for being cold, for once looking down on me, making me not bow my head and live a more wonderful life. You have never been competing with anyone, not with a team, but your true enemy has always been yourself. In June 2011, this driver from Germany, driving the dream of Dallas, finally had the opportunity to fight against fate one more time. The Heat is no longer the Heat of the past, the Mavericks are no longer the Mavericks of the past, and Nowitzki is no longer the Dirk of the past. He has always felt guilty, and he will use his iron will to be tempered in the Heat's furnace and become steel! (Warm)"

巴萨主力后卫伤3周错过国家德比与曼联争夺拜仁边翼新浪体育讯　当地时间昨日，巴塞罗那队医对队内的法国左后卫阿比达尔进行了伤势检测，结果显示阿比达尔将因伤缺阵3个星期。在几天之前，阿比达尔应法国国家队的征召参加世预赛附加赛的比赛，在客场1-0战胜爱尔兰的比赛中，阿比达尔改打中后卫，表现中规中矩。但不幸的是，阿比达尔在比赛中受伤，赛后检测结果显示他的左脚肌肉腱膜拉伤，需要休养三周的时间。因为此次伤势，阿比达尔将错过接下来法国队与爱尔兰的第二回合附加赛比赛。按照3周的休战时间估算，阿比达尔还将错过本月底在诺坎普球场与皇家马德里队进行的国家德比。随着年龄的增大，阿比达尔的伤势逐渐增多，这已经是阿比达尔本赛季第二次因伤长时间缺阵，上赛季他的伤病次数就已经很多。在阿比达尔受伤期间，巴西后卫马克斯维尔将出任球队主力左后卫。而阿比达尔的频繁受伤，也让巴萨边后卫引援的传言再次响起。据法国一家媒体披露，拜仁后卫拉姆有意离开拜仁，巴萨、曼联、尤文图斯等豪门球队都将加入争夺当中；如果拉姆加盟巴萨，将与阿尔维斯形成左右齐飞的边后卫助攻形式。(伊雷克森)	阿比达尔,马克斯维尔,拉姆,阿尔维斯,伊雷克森	正向	Barcelona's main defender Abidal will miss the national match with Manchester United for three weeks after the team doctor tested his injury. A few days ago, Abidal was called up by the French national team to participate in the World Cup qualification playoff match. In the match where France won 1-0 away from home, Abidal played as a center back and performed as expected. Unfortunately, Abidal was injured during the match, and the post-game test results showed that he had a tear in the tendon of the left foot muscle, and he needs to rest for three weeks. Due to this injury, Abidal will miss the second leg of the附加赛 between France and Ireland. Based on a three-week ceasefire, Abidal will miss the national derby against Real Madrid at the Camp Nou stadium at the end of this month. As Abidal’s age increases, his injuries are gradually increasing. This is already Abidal's second long-term absence due to injury this season, and the number of injuries last season was already very many. During Abidal's injury, Maxwell, the Brazilian defender, will be the team's starting left back. And Abidal's frequent injuries have also led to rumors of Barcelona's left-back transfer again.

温泉狂人肖睿哲从26岁的肖睿哲身上，你可以看到幼小的梦也能发芽、茁壮成长。这个生于80后的男孩，是近日热议的“阿里云”的一员，也是phpwind(杭州德天信息技术有限公司)的副总。工作时，他表现出超越年龄的成熟；生活里却依然顽皮如少年，依赖妈妈。他的目标是成为能力挽狂澜的“英雄式企业家”，一个企业的灵魂人物。肖睿哲每天的日程安排都很满，比如今天：上午先在酒店处理琐碎的事务性问题，中午接受采访，下午跟全体北京同事开大会，晚上继续进行产品研发，全天没一刻休息。接受采访前，肖睿哲利用短暂的半小时在健身房里跑步，他说出出汗能让他精力充沛。毕竟，这个26岁的大男孩，体内充满了能量。肖睿哲出生在武汉一个商人家庭，爸爸早期经商，所以家境殷实。但是因为一次失败的地产投资，爸爸的事业境况跌入谷底。肖睿哲从他身上看到命运无常，也埋下从逆境中扭转命运的决心。从phpwind到云计算或许来自爸爸的商人基因，肖睿哲一直有创业梦想。在高中时期他已经和同学创建过自己的游戏网站，甚至有过一些收入。但高中时期创业单凭着一种冲动，一心想吧网站做大，却不知道通过什么途径才能让网站稳步发展起来。不过那一次体验和经历，为肖睿哲后来的事业埋下伏笔。以不错的成绩考上北京交通大学后，肖睿哲却因为再次创业耽误了学业，导致没有顺利毕业。这次创业过程里，肖睿哲学到了现实操作经验。毕业前，为了证明自己的能力，他参加了毕业论文的选拔，并在评选中获得了第一名的成绩。毕业后，肖睿哲曾经在广告公司和网游公司打过工，当时他的同学王学集、林耀纳已经开始筹备创建phpwind了。2006年，应王学集之邀，肖睿哲终于找到“属于自己的归宿”，和同学一起重新打拼。刚进phpwind时，这里是只有20人的小公司，员工里一半是同学，一半是网友，公司开在大学园区里，租着3000元一个月的房子办公，办公家具和电脑都选性价比最高的。这个时期，肖睿哲已经感受到自己必须承担的责任，再不能只为个人梦想而忽视团队的存在，管理者是要对所有员工前途负责的。他开始学习江浙人的经商模式，“江浙人对成本管理得很严谨，今天花的钱一定会成为明天的产出。”正因为尽量压低成本，才使phpwind没有早早夭折。第一笔风险投资是来自王定标的300万元，这让创业中的几个年轻人信心倍增。有钱了，但几个人还是尽量压缩成本，公司搬到便宜的创业园区；每年两次到北京都事先攒好一堆出差要做的工作，借快捷酒店的折扣卡，让差旅费的价值最大化。还有一件事，让肖睿哲至今都津津乐道。那是创业期的春节，他们手里只有2万元现金给员工发奖金。拿着薄薄一沓子钱，面对30个员工，如何分配？肖睿哲恨不得写个程序出来。令他欣慰的是，同事们在春节聚会上并没有计较奖金多少，而是因为公司的发展喝了个痛快淋漓，这个春节让他记忆犹新。在phpwind的成长中，肖睿哲学会了如何管理团队，如何应对竞争。虽然公司已经发展到200人，除了杭州总部，今年又开设了北京分公司，但创业时期的同事基本没有流失。肖睿哲说：“当时管理团队都是讲感情，现在要靠激励制度和规范的管理模式，不能像以前那样感性管理了。”而产品在大规模使用后，也带来了研发上的压力。为了对产品进行升级，肖睿哲和同事3天3夜住在公司，因为没脱过鞋最终导致细菌感染。好在这些付出终于看到了回报。阿里巴巴经过半年时间考察phpwind，从他们的研发技术到人员心态，经过几轮谈判最终将phpwind收编旗下，成为阿里云计算中心的一部分。虽进入阿里云的团队，但phpwind还独立运营自己的业务，这种两条腿走路的模式使他们机会更多，也搭上IT“大佬”的顺风车。在阿里云，肖睿哲遇到了自己的偶像王坚，这个有3个博士学位的前浙大院长，40岁出头已经是技术派里的顶尖级人物，同时又有感性的一面，是那种在企业里闪闪发光的灵魂人物。成为企业里的灵魂人物，在逆境中成为力挽狂澜的英雄是肖睿哲一直以来的梦想，为此，他在20多岁时让自己尽情磨砺，或许30岁的肖睿哲，就会成为下一个马云。从创业型企业到中型企业，时间对肖睿哲来说总是不够用。但是与前辈们不同，这个80后的IT管理者更关注“人”的感受。Phpwind团队建设中很重要的是“OUTTING”，就是公司选个山清水秀的地方或者开会、或者进行培训。肖睿哲相信，玩乐和工作是可以统一结合的，虽然每次他并没有太多精力去享受山水，看着同事们能在头脑风暴后彻底放松，自己也会笑得痛快。温泉收集狂以前，肖睿哲是个电子产品的收集狂人，这与他是IT从业者有关，只要有新的电子产品发布，他第一时间买回来，还经常自己拆机改装。大到电脑主机、小到手机、数码相机，在杭州的家里已经堆了一座小山似的电子藏品。近年来，随着事业发展和个性成熟，肖睿哲对电子产品已经没那么发烧了，现在的他，算是一个温泉收集狂人，并且在心目中有属于自己的温泉排行榜。第一次泡温泉，还是在北京读书时去的小汤山九华山庄，那次经历让他失望透了。“温泉池的水很可疑，而且人又多，风景也不美。”再次泡温泉，已经是几年后在杭州做phpwind了，肖睿哲去了杭州附近的金华武义温泉，那里有个清水湾温泉度假村，里面有各种风格的温泉池，还有可爱的鱼疗设施。武义一行，让肖睿智开始迷恋上温泉。“可能因为裸体状态和在水里的时候人最放松，所以洗澡、泡温泉会让我思路更清晰，压力很快消失了。”肖睿哲很推崇黄山的醉温泉，在山里泡汤的时候，身边是郁郁葱葱的山林，晚上边喝酒边泡汤，和朋友聊天，更是惬意。北海是肖睿哲经常去的地方，他喜欢涠洲岛未开发的静僻，更喜欢那里接近大自然朴实风格的温泉。为了泡温泉，肖睿哲还去过日本北海道，“是全裸温泉，风景非常震撼，外边下着雪，我们在热乎乎的温泉里喝酒，太享受了。”只不过因为身在异地，肖睿哲觉得日本温泉虽然好，却少一分自在怡然的心情。肖睿哲心目中的第一位，是厦门的日月谷温泉，那里不仅风景美，食物好吃，温泉水更是地道的矿物质水。目前为止，肖睿哲已经去过快10处温泉了，未来还打算到欧洲的温泉感受一下，“听说古代欧洲人都是用温泉治病养生的。”和很多“啃老”的80后比，当了副总的肖睿哲是个难得的孝顺孩子，为了让商场失意的爸爸振作起来，肖睿哲把父母接到杭州自己身边，“不是怕他们不放心我，而是我不放心他们。”每天早上，肖睿哲吃完妈妈做的早饭上班，中午吃妈妈亲手做的爱心便当，晚上11点下班后，妈妈已经煮好甜汤等他，一家人聚在一起边喝汤边聊天。肖睿哲还为妈妈办了信用卡的副卡，让她随便买自己喜欢的东西，让爸爸做自己喜欢的事，这就是他表达爱的方式。“我已经有能力承担照顾这个家的责任，现在的心愿就是看着爸爸妈妈快乐，不要再操心。”其实付出爱的同时，他也感受到爱的力量。“每次出差住酒店都要自己洗衣服烫衣服，这时候就发现妈妈在身边的好。”工作上遇到困境难题，想到妈妈爸爸在家期待自己的样子，就会充满努力的勇气。这个26岁的大男孩，学会了照顾一家公司，照顾自己的家人、同事，看着自己幼小的梦想慢慢发芽、茁壮成长，庆幸着自己的青春没有被辜负。肖睿哲的温泉指南武义温泉位于浙江金华，除了传统的温泉，还设有酸奶池、咖啡池、灵芝池、丹桂池、名木池、名花池、芦荟池、酒池、武阳春雨池(茶叶温泉)、西湖池(造型像西湖，里面也同样衬有三潭印月)、鱼疗池等。黄山醉温泉位于安徽黄山景区内，共分7大主题，分别为水疗区、动感区、养颜区、美食区、温泉广场区、微粹区与木屋区，共有50多种系列60多个温泉池。醉温泉属于偏硅酸多元复合型温泉，富含偏硅酸、钾、钠、镁、溴、铁等微量元素，水质中性温和，PH值为6.6。涠洲温泉涠洲岛是我国最大最年轻的死火山岛，位于广西北海市东南面36海里处，与银滩隔海相望。它附近有一个斜阳岛，站在涠洲岛上可以观看到太阳斜照该岛的情景，这就是著名的“涠州斜阳”。岛上温泉天然纯朴，游客边品尝海鲜边泡汤，是难得的美食与温泉完美结合的地方。北海温泉位于云南腾冲，最初是简陋的露天洗浴澡塘，热水统一由一眼机井供应，水温55℃，每昼夜涌水1100立方米。经多家地质部门勘查检验，其水质是低矿化度的碳酸温泉，并含有少量对人体有益的微量元素和放射性元素，除可用作洗浴疗疾外，还可供制成非常好的饮用矿泉水，是腾冲为数不多的既可浴又可饮用的温泉之一。厦门日月谷温泉总体规划26万平方米，气势磅礴，富有浓郁东南亚异国风情，设有近百个露天温泉泡池，几十种特色温泉。日月谷温泉水源自地下200米深处，出口水温82℃，用纯正的温泉水煮出的蛋，充分吸收了泉水中的矿物质，补充人体每日所需多种营养素，有良好的保健养生功效。怒江边的温泉云南怒江傈傈族自治州泸水县，最出名的民俗是春节期间举行的“澡塘会”了。人们下到烫人的简易石砌温泉澡池中，洗去污垢，舒展筋骨，然后聚在一起谈天说地，对歌跳舞，其实也就是傈僳族的狂欢节。德宗温泉距离拉萨140公里，位于山谷之中，两旁山坡是高山牧场，绿草如茵。温泉是气泡浴，可以治很多皮肤病。池子分为男池和女池，中间隔着一堵石墙。有趣的是德宗温泉的狗，天天在那儿懒洋洋地晒太阳，看着那些赤身裸体的人。美圻/文范永恒/摄影	肖睿哲,肖睿,妈妈,爸爸,王学集,林耀纳,王定标,王坚,马云,肖睿智,德宗	正向	"From the hot spring enthusiast Xiao Ruize, you can see that small dreams can also germinate and grow robustly from the 26-year-old Xiao Ruize. This boy, born in the 80s, is a member of the recently hot ""Ali Cloud"", and is also the deputy general manager of phpwind (Hangzhou De Tian Information Technology Co., Ltd.). At work, he shows maturity beyond his age, but in life, he is still playful like a teenager and relies on his mother. His goal is to become a “heroic entrepreneur” who can turn things around, a soul of the enterprise. Xiao Ruize's schedule is full every day, for example, today: in the morning, he handled some trivial matters in the hotel, had an interview at noon, held a meeting with all the colleagues in Beijing in the afternoon, and continued to develop the product at night. He didn't have a moment's rest all day. Before the interview, Xiao Ruize took a half hour to run in the gym, saying that sweating could make him energetic. After all, this 26-year-old big boy is full of energy. Xiao Ruize was born in a business family in Wuhan, where his father was engaged in business early on, so the family was well-off. But his business situation plunged to the bottom because of a failed real estate investment. Xiao Ruize saw the capriciousness of fate in him, and also planted the resolve to turn his fate around in adversity. From phpwind to cloud computing, perhaps originating from his father's business genes, Xiao Ruize has always had the dream of entrepreneurship. He had already created his own game website with classmates in high school and even earned some income. But in high school, starting a business was just a spur-of-the-moment decision, wanting to make the website bigger, but not knowing how to make the website develop steadily. But that experience and experience sowed the seeds for Xiao Ruize's later career. After Xio Ruozhe was admitted to Beijing Jiaotong University with good grades, he delayed his studies due to his second entrepreneurial venture, which led to his failure to graduate smoothly. During this entrepreneurial process, Xiao Rui learned practical operating experience. Before graduation, in order to prove his ability, he participated in the selection for the graduation thesis and won the first place in the evaluation. After graduation, Xiao Ruize once worked in an advertising company and a game company. At that time, his classmates, Wang Xueji and Lin Yaona, had already started to prepare to create phpwind. In 2006, under Wang Xueji's invitation, Xiao Ruizhe finally found ""his own home"" and started to work hard again with his classmates. When I first joined PHPWind, it was a small company with only 20 people, half of whom were classmates and the other half were online friends. The company was located in a university district, renting a 3000 yuan per month office, and the office furniture and computers were chosen to be the most cost-effective. During this period, Xiao Ruize had already felt the responsibility he had to shoulder, and could no longer ignore the existence of the team for the sake of his personal dreams. Managers are responsible for the future of all employees. He began to learn the business model of people from Jiang-Zhe, ""Jiang-Zhe people manage costs very strictly, and the money spent today will definitely become the output of tomorrow."" That's why PHPWind did not die young because of the efforts to minimize costs. The first risk investment came from Wang Dingbiao’s 3 million yuan, which boosted the confidence of several young entrepreneurs. With money, but the few people still try to compress costs, the company moved to a cheaper incubator; before going to Beijing twice a year, they accumulated a pile of work to be done on business trips, used the discount cards of the hotel, and maximized the value of the business trip expenses. There is another thing that still makes Xiao Ruize talk about it with great interest. It was the Spring Festival during the start-up period, and they only had 20,000 yuan in cash to give as bonuses to their employees. With a thin stack of money in hand, how to distribute it among 30 employees?  Xiao Ruizhe wished he could write a program. To his delight, his colleagues did not quarrel over the amount of the bonus at the Spring Festival party, but drank to their heart's content for the company's development, which made this Spring Festival unforgettable for him. During the growth of phpwind, Xiao Ruize learned how to manage a team and how to cope with competition. Although the company has grown to 200 people, apart from the Hangzhou headquarters, a Beijing branch was opened this year, but most of the colleagues from the start-up period have not been lost. Xiao Ruizhe said, ""At that time, the management team was all about emotions, but now we need to rely on incentive systems and standardized management models, and we can't manage in a sentimental way as before."" And the product also brought pressure on R&D after it was widely used. In order to upgrade the product, Xiao Ruizhe and his colleagues lived in the company for three days and three nights, and finally developed a bacterial infection because they did not take off their shoes. Fortunately, the efforts have finally paid off. After half a year of investigation of phpwind by Alibaba, from their research and development technology to the mentality of the personnel, after several rounds of negotiations, phpwind was finally incorporated into the Alibaba Cloud Computing Center. Though it has joined Alibaba Cloud, phpwind still operates its own business independently, and this two-pronged approach has given them more opportunities and allowed them to ride on the coattails of IT ""big shots"". At Alibaba Cloud, Xiao Ruizhe met his idol, Wang Jian, the former dean of Zhejiang University with three doctorates, who was already a top figure in the technical field in his forties, and also had a sensitive side, a soul figure who shone in the enterprise. To be the soul of a company and a hero who turns the tide in adversity has always been Xiao Ruizhé’s dream. For this, he let himself be thoroughly tempered in his twenties. Perhaps Xiao Ruizhé at the age of 30 will become the next Ma Yun. For Xiao Ruizhé, time is always not enough, from start-ups to medium-sized enterprises. But unlike his predecessors, this IT manager in his 80s is more concerned with the feelings of “people”. An important part of the Phpwind team building is “OUTTING”, which is a place with mountains and clear water selected by the company for meetings or training. Xiao Ruize believes that play and work can be unified, although he doesn't have much energy to enjoy the mountains and rivers each time. He will laugh heartily when he sees his colleagues completely relax after brainstorming. Before he became a hot spring enthusiast, Xiao Ruize was a collector of electronic products, which was related to his work as an IT professional. As soon as new electronic products were released, he would buy them immediately and often disassembled and modified them himself. From big computer hosts to small mobile phones and digital cameras, there is a small mountain of electronic collections in my home in Hangzhou. In recent years, with the development of his career and the maturity of his personality, Xiao Ruize has become less enthusiastic about electronic products. Now, he is a hot spring collector, and he has his own hot spring ranking in his heart. His first hot spring experience was in Jiu Hua Villa in Xiaotangshan, Beijing, where he was studying, and he was thoroughly disappointed. The water in the hot spring pool is suspicious, and there are too many people. The scenery is also not beautiful. Taking a hot spring bath again was several years later when PHPWind was done in Hangzhou. Xiao Ruize went to the hot springs in Wuyi, Jinhua, near Hangzhou. There is a Clear Water Bay Hot Spring Resort there, which has hot spring pools of various styles and cute fish therapy facilities. Wuyi trip made Xiao RuiZhi fall in love with hot springs. Perhaps because people are most relaxed when naked and in water, taking a bath or soaking in a hot spring clears my mind and quickly relieves my stress. Xiao Ruize is very fond of the Drunken Hot Spring in Huangshan. When he bathes in the hot spring in the mountains, there are lush forests around him. In the evening, he drinks and bathes in the hot spring, and chats with friends, which is even more pleasant. Beihai is where Xiao Ruizhé often goes. He likes the quiet and secluded of Weizhou Island, and he likes the natural and simple style of the hot springs there. In order to enjoy hot springs, Xiao Ruizhe also went to Hokkaido, Japan, ""It is a naked hot spring, the scenery is very impressive, it was snowing outside, and we were drinking wine in the warm hot spring, it was too enjoyable."" It was just that Xiao Ruize felt that although the Japanese hot springs were good, they lacked a sense of ease and contentment because he was away from home. The first place in Xiao Ruizhe’s heart is the Dayue Valley Hot Spring in Xiamen, where not only is the scenery beautiful and the food delicious, but the hot spring water is also genuine mineral water. So far, Xiao Ruize has visited nearly 10 hot springs, and he plans to experience the hot springs in Europe in the future, ""I heard that the ancient Europeans used hot springs to treat and maintain health."" Compared with many 80s who rely on their parents, Xiao Ruizhé, who became a vice president, is a rare filial child. In order to cheer up his father who was disappointed in the mall, Xiao Ruizhé moved his parents to Hangzhou. It is not that he is afraid that they will not be concerned about him, but that he is not concerned about them. Every morning, Xiao Ruize eats breakfast made by his mother before going to work, has a lunchbox made by his mother with love for lunch, and after work at 11 p.m., his mother has already prepared sweet soup for him to wait for him. The whole family gathers to drink soup and chat together.  Xiao Ruizhe also got a supplementary card for his mother, letting her buy whatever she liked, and letting his father do whatever he liked, which was his way of expressing love. I have the ability to take on the responsibility of taking care of the family now, and my wish is to see my parents happy and not worry about them anymore. In fact, while he was giving love, he also felt the power of love. Every time I stay in a hotel on a business trip, I have to wash and iron my own clothes, and then I realize how good it is to have my mother around. When encountering difficulties at work, thinking about the look of Mom and Dad at home waiting for me, I will be full of the courage to work hard. This 26-year-old big boy has learned to take care of a company, take care of his family and colleagues, watch his young dreams sprout and grow strong, and be grateful that his youth was not wasted. Xiao Ruize's hot spring guide, Wuyi hot spring is located in Jinhua, Zhejiang. In addition to traditional hot springs, there are also yogurt pools, coffee pools, reishi pools, osmanthus pools, famous tree pools, famous flower pools, aloe pools, wine pools, Wu Yang Chun Yu pools (tea hot springs), West Lake pools (the shape is like West Lake, and there are also three moons in the water), fish therapy pools, etc. The Huangshan Drunken Hot Spring is located in the Huangshan scenic area in Anhui Province, and is divided into 7 major themes, namely, the hydrotherapy area, the dynamic area, the beauty area, the food and beverage area, the hot spring square area, the micro essence area, and the wooden house area, with a total of more than 50 series and 60 hot spring pools. Drunk Hot Spring belongs to a multi-complex thermal spring with orthosilicic acid, rich in orthosilicic acid, potassium, sodium, magnesium, bromine, iron and other trace elements, with a neutral and mild water quality, pH value of 6.6. Weizhou Hot Spring Weizhou Island is the largest and youngest extinct volcano island in China, located 36 nautical miles southeast of Beihai City, Guangxi, facing the Silver Beach across the sea. There is a Sunset Island nearby, and standing on Weizhou Island, you can see the sun shining obliquely on the island, which is known as the famous ""Weizhou Sunset"". The hot springs on the island are natural and simple. Tourists can enjoy seafood while soaking in the hot springs, which is a rare combination of delicious food and hot springs. The Beihai hot spring is located in Tengchong, Yunnan. It was originally a simple open-air bathing pond, with hot water supplied by a single well, with a water temperature of 55℃ and a daily water output of 1100 cubic meters. After the geological departments have examined and tested it, the water quality is low mineralization carbonic hot spring water, which contains a small amount of beneficial trace elements and radioactive elements for the human body. In addition to being used for bathing and treating diseases, it can also be made into high-quality drinking mineral water, which is one of the few hot springs in Tengchong that can be bathed and drunk. The Xiamen Ruyegu Hot Spring Master Plan covers 260,000 square meters, with a magnificent and rich Southeast Asian exotic style, and has nearly a hundred open-air hot spring soaking pools and dozens of characteristic hot springs. The hot spring water of the Sun Moon Valley comes from 200 meters underground, and the outlet water temperature is 82℃. The eggs cooked with pure hot spring water fully absorb the minerals in the hot spring water, replenish various nutrients needed by the human body every day, and have good health care and health care effects. The hot springs by the Nujiang River in Lushui County, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, are the most famous folk customs, which are held during the Spring Festival, called ""Bath Pond Meeting"". People go down to the hot and simple stone hot spring bath pool, wash away the dirt, stretch their muscles and bones, and then gather together to talk and sing, actually it is also the festival of the Lisu people. Dezong Hot Spring is 140 kilometers away from Lhasa, located in a valley, with high mountain pastures on both sides of the mountain, and green grass like a carpet. The hot springs are bubble baths that can treat many skin diseases. The pools are divided into male and female pools, separated by a stone wall. Interestingly, the dogs at Deyong Hot Springs laze around basking in the sun, watching those naked people. Meiqi/Wen Fan Everlasting/Photography"
诺伦领先威尔士赛次轮麦克道尔居次席达利出局新浪体育讯　北京时间6月4日，在拿到个人首次角逐美国公开赛资格的四天之后，瑞典人亚历山大-诺伦(AlexanderNoren)周五在凯尔特庄园以一杆优势获得欧巡赛-威尔士公开赛次轮的领先，世界排名第五的卫冕冠军格莱姆-麦克道尔位居次席，而首次参赛的美国名将约翰-达利、莱德杯明星西蒙尼斯、罗斯-菲舍尔都被淘汰。在威尔士公开赛第二轮的比赛中，世界排名第127位的诺伦连续第二天打出67杆(-4)，以134杆(-8)的总成绩排在第1位。北爱尔兰名将麦克道尔交出68杆(-3)，以135杆(-7)的总成绩位居第2位。威尔士本土球手杰米-唐纳森(JamieDonaldson，68杆)与法国球手维克多-杜比森(VictorDubuisson，69杆)都以136杆(-6)的总成绩排在并列第3位。首轮领先者基斯-霍恩(KeithHorne，73杆)、去年莱德杯欧洲队队员彼得-汉森(72杆)、英格兰老将巴里-莱恩(BarryLane，69杆)都一道以137杆(-5)的总成绩位居并列第5位，其中，将在本月底年满51岁的莱恩有望在这里成为欧巡赛夺冠年龄最大的球手。本周一，诺伦在英格兰沃尔登-希思高尔夫俱乐部(WaltonHeathGolfClub)举行的美国公开赛欧洲区选拔赛上成功闯关，首次获得了在美国进行的大满贯赛的参赛资格。这无疑令他胸有成竹地来到凯尔特庄园。“我一直以来都梦想着参加一场美国公开赛，我非常高兴，非常高兴，这极大地增强了活力。”这位28岁的瑞典人此前只参加过两场英国公开赛，其中在2008年的英国公开赛上获得了并列第19名的佳绩。在威尔士公开赛的第二轮里，诺伦最后阶段的表现非常突出，在最后5个洞抓下4只小鸟，从而以一杆优势上升至榜首位置。由于他早上出发比赛，很早便完成了比赛，当时他还错误地预估次轮领先者的总杆数为-9或者-10。毕竟，最终夺得36洞领先的便是打出-8的诺伦本人。“球场打起来感觉很长，就像你平常要用很多挖起杆来击球，到了今天，却要换上7号铁、6号铁、5号铁来击球。你能够打得相当安全，不过你将面临着较长的推杆距离，难推的推杆，如果你想要抓下小鸟，这会非常困难。”诺伦在欧巡赛只获得了一个冠军，那就是2009年的欧米茄欧洲大师赛。麦克道尔同样在5个洞里迎来了4只小鸟，那是从8号洞开始的。然而，他本轮的亮点还有在较短的10号洞里从沙坑的边缘下打出的精彩救球。“其中一个男孩说，塞弗(塞弗-巴耶斯德罗斯)将会为那一杆感到骄傲。”麦克道尔说，“我站在喜欢的一座球场上，处于我享受的位置上。这绝对是备战美国公开赛(他两周之后也要展开美国公开赛的卫冕战)的完美时刻。我说过我只是想要进入冠军争夺战，激发灵感，现在有几分完成任务的感觉。”麦克道尔将力争成为威尔士公开赛12年历史里第一位成功卫冕的冠军。唐纳森则成为目前排名最高的威尔士本土球手，他依旧在追寻个人职业生涯的首个欧巡赛桂冠。“我打得非常好，也许我今天打得比昨天更好，不过昨天我打得相当不错。今天的比赛很艰难，因为有风，因此保持你的杆数、保住多个洞的标准杆很重要。”继苏格兰球手艾略特-索特曼(ElliotSaltman)周四在211码的17号洞打出一杆进洞之后，周五又有另外一名苏格兰人乔治-默瑞(GeorgeMurray)在17号洞打出了一杆进洞。只可惜，只有在189码的13号洞打出一杆进洞才能获得赞助商提供的汽车大奖。威尔士公开赛两轮比赛过后，晋级决赛的资格线设为144杆(+2)的总成绩，总共有65名球手入围决赛。世界排名第26位的西班牙名将、去年莱德杯欧洲队队员西蒙尼斯(73-72)、去年莱德杯欧洲队副队长之一托马斯-比约恩(69-76)、印度名将米哈辛(68-79)、2008年莱德杯欧洲队队员奥利弗-威尔逊(73-77)、三届亚巡赛奖金王通差-贾第(76-75)、去年莱德杯欧洲队队员罗斯-菲舍尔(70-79)、首次角逐威尔士公开赛的两届大满贯冠军约翰-达利(77-75)、八届欧巡赛奖金王及2010年莱德杯欧洲队获胜队长蒙哥马利(78-79)等名将都被淘汰出局。其中，世界排名第52位的菲舍尔在被淘汰之后极有可能依旧处于世界排名前50名之外，这意味着他很可能与两周后举行的美国公开赛失之交臂。浏览成绩>>(罗毅)	诺伦,麦克道尔,亚历山大-诺伦,格莱姆-麦克道尔,约翰-达利,西蒙尼斯,罗斯-菲舍尔,菲舍尔,杰米-唐纳森,唐纳森,VictorDubuisson,基斯-霍恩,KeithHorne,彼得-汉森,巴里-莱恩,BarryLane,塞弗-巴耶斯德罗斯,艾略特-索特曼,索特曼,乔治-默瑞,默瑞,托马斯-比约恩,米哈辛,奥利弗-威尔逊,通差-贾第,蒙哥马利,罗毅	正向	"Noren leads the second round of the Welsh Open, McDowell in second, Daly out. Sina Sports News, June 4, 2016 - Four days after winning his first qualification for the US Open, the Swede Alexander Noren (Alexander Noren) won the second round of the Welsh Open at the Celtic Manor with a one-stroke lead. The defending champion with the fifth ranking in the world, Graeme McDowell, is in second place, while the American star John Daly, the Ryder Cup star Simonis, and Ross Fisher were eliminated in their first appearance. Noren, ranked 127th in the world, shot a second consecutive 67 (-4) in the second round of the Wales Open, and led with a total score of 134 (-8). McIlroy, the Northern Ireland ace, carded a 68 (-3) and was second with a total score of 135 (-7). Jamie Donaldson, a Welsh native (68), and Victor Dubuisson of France (69) are tied for third place with a total score of 136 (-6). The first round leaders, Keith Horne (73), who is one of the players on the European Ryder Cup team last year, Peter Hanson (72), and the English veteran Barry Lane (69), are all tied for fifth place with a total score of 137 (-5). Among them, Barry Lane, who will turn 51 at the end of this month, is expected to become the oldest winner of the European Tour here. Norren successfully made it through the U.S. Open European Qualifier at Walton Heath Golf Club in Walden, England, this Monday, and for the first time, he has qualified for a major in the U.S. This certainly gave him the confidence to arrive at the Celtic Manor. I have always dreamed of participating in the US Open, and I am very happy, very happy, which greatly enhances vitality. This 28-year-old Swede had only played in two Open Championships before, and he tied for 19th at the 2008 Open Championship. In the second round of the Wales Open, Noren performed very well in the last stage, and captured 4 eagles in the last 5 holes, thus rising to the top by one stroke. Since he left for the competition early in the morning, he finished the competition early, and at that time, he mistakenly estimated the total number of strokes of the leader in the second round to be -9 or -10. After all, it was Noren himself who ended up leading after 36 holes with a score of -8. The course felt long to play, as if you needed to use a lot of fairway woods to hit the ball, but today you had to use a 7-iron, 6-iron, and 5-iron. You can play quite safely, but you will face a long putter distance and a difficult putter if you want to get a birdie, which will be very difficult. Noren only won one tournament on the European Tour, which was the Omega European Masters in 2009. McDoel also had four birdies in five holes, starting from the 8th hole. However, his highlight of the round was a brilliant recovery from the edge of the sand trap on the shorter 10th hole. One of the boys said that Sever (Seve Ballesteros) would be proud of that shot. McDoar said, ""I am standing on a course I like, in a position I enjoy."" This is definitely the perfect moment to gear up for the US Open (he will defend his US Open title two weeks later). I said that I just wanted to enter the championship, inspire, and now I have a sense of completing the task. McDoel will strive to become the first champion to successfully defend his title in the 12-year history of the Welsh Open. Donohue, meanwhile, has risen to become the highest-ranked Welsh player in the world, and he is still chasing his first European Tour title of his career. I played very well, maybe even better than yesterday, but I played quite well yesterday. The game today was tough because of the wind, so it was important to keep your score and hold multiple holes at par. Following a hole-in-one by Elliot Saltman, a Scottish player, on the 17th hole, which measures 211 yards, on Thursday, another Scottish player, George Murray, also made a hole-in-one on the 17th hole on Friday. Unfortunately, it takes a hole-in-one at the 13th hole, 189 yards in length, to win the car prize provided by the sponsor. After two rounds of the Welsh Open, the cut-off score for the final qualification was set at 144 strokes (+2), with a total of 65 players qualifying for the final. The 26th ranked Spanish star, Simonis, who was a member of the European team in the 2017 Ryder Cup (73-72), one of the vice-captains of the European team in the 2017 Ryder Cup, Thomas Bjørn (69-76), Indian star Vijay Singh (68-79), Oliver Wilson, a member of the European team in the 2008 Ryder Cup (73-77), three-time Asian Tour money king Thongchai Jaidee (76-75), Ross Fisher, a member of the European team in the 2017 Ryder Cup (70-79), John Daly, a two-time major champion making his debut in the Welsh Open (77-75), and Montgomerie, the eight-time European Tour money king and the winning captain of the European team in the 2010 Ryder Cup (78-79), and other stars were eliminated. Fischer, who is ranked 52nd in the world, is likely to remain outside the top 50 after his elimination, which means he is likely to miss the U.S. Open in two weeks. Browse Scores>>(Luo Yi)"

The market trading volume was still very light. In the past 20 trading days, the average daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was over 1.5 billion shares, but only 800 million shares were traded today. There was no important economic data released today, nor any important company news, and the stock market was running according to its own rules. Due to the US stock and bond markets being closed next Monday for Memorial Day in the US, many investors have already left the market to enjoy the long weekend. The market is trading with little volume and unclear direction. Despite the sluggish stock market, the foreign exchange market's bears attacked the US dollar, causing the US dollar index to fall by 0.7%. The US dollar's decline boosted the performance of precious metals, and the CRB commodity futures index also rose by 0.7%, but the raw materials sector only rose by 0.1%, with even lower gains than the broader market. The performance of the financial sector also lagged the broader market, which is currently down 0.3%.

After Standard & Poor's announced on Thursday that it had placed the UK's AAA credit rating on negative watch, industrial and material shares were hit, dragging the US stock market down across the board. At the close, the S&P 500 fell 15 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 129 points, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 32 points. With the AAA credit rating of the UK, which is under threat of downgrade in the shadow of the lingering economic crisis, the impact may be long-term and far-reaching, according to Jim Reid, a credit strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a text message to clients. In the last nine trading days, the S&P 500 has fallen for seven days in a row. “Optimists’ view is being tested at the crucial moment,” Lena Komileva, of G7’s Market Economics Department, wrote in a text message to clients. Recent economic data have reinforced the view that the global economic downturn following the Lehman period is over, and that the slowing rate of global economic decline appears to be a normal early sign of recovery, but it does not fit the normal economic cycle. On Friday, the Bank of Japan announced that there were signs of improvement in the Japanese economy. This is the BoJ's first such statement in three years. At the same time, the Washington Post reported that the Obama administration is working to get General Motors Corporation. ) will go bankrupt before next weekend.

车主为防柴油被偷每日花1小时将油抽出拎回家前晚10点多，有市民报警称一对男女拿着自制的抽油泵，正在偷南京春江街路边工程车油箱内的柴油。警方迅速赶到现场，发现是场误会，该男女就是工程车车主，最近加柴油难，小偷又频繁光顾，偷他们车里的油。他们实在被偷怕了，无奈之下才想出防偷笨招，每天将油箱内柴油抽出，拎回家过夜，第二天早晨再将油倒进油箱。虽然很折腾，但是每天回家睡觉心里踏实了。虚惊一场有人晚上偷工程车柴油南京春江街道路宽敞，道路两边慢车道成了免费停车场，一到晚间就有大量货车、吊车、工程车停靠于此。前晚10点，张先生驾车至春江街寻找空地停车时，发现一个男子拿着自制的抽油泵，正在抽取一辆工程车油箱内的柴油，抽出来的柴油全部流进一只扁平的铁皮油桶中。男子身旁有个女子一直在左顾右盼，时不时还催促一下男子抓紧抽油。很快，工程车油箱内柴油被抽光，那对男女将抽出来的柴油封存，快速塞进一辆面包车中。“最近好多加油站没有柴油，就是有柴油的加油站，车辆也排成长龙，不等个个把小时加不到油。那对男女半夜出来抽柴油，举动古怪，一看就像偷柴油的。”张先生说，他也没多想，就拨打110报警。冤枉我们是在防油被偷很快，110民警赶到春江街巡查，那对男女远远见到警车，并无躲闪之意，而是继续抽着柴油，这“肆无忌惮”的一幕让民警也觉得诧异。民警核对了男女的身份信息和车辆信息，结果发现是一场误会，这对男女不是偷油贼，他们是一对夫妇，是这辆工程车车主，抽走油箱内的油只是防止小偷下贼手偷油。虚惊背后是无奈据男子王某介绍，他在南京一家工地做工程，除了拥有两辆工程车外，他还有一辆小型吊车。这段时间柴油紧张，想到自己的三台车每天都要开工，他每天下班前都会让工人将三台车加满油。这样，早上一起来就可以出车开工，不会耽误工期。可是五天前的一个早上，王师傅吃过早餐开车出发时，却发现吊车仪表盘上显示剩余柴油不多。前一晚上刚加的油怎么就没了呢？王师傅下车检查油箱，油箱一点破损没有，可油箱见底，这时他才明白遭贼了。王师傅懊恼不已，急忙查看另外两辆工程车油箱，结果发现工程车油箱也被偷空了。“损失两千多元油费不说，工地一天的活也算泡汤了。”王师傅当时就向警方报了警。警方到场做了备案登记，并展开调查。不想事隔一天，前面的偷油案还没查出个结果，自己的吊车油箱又被贼光顾了，又损失了一箱柴油，耽误了一天工期。实在是被贼偷怕了，王师傅夫妇才想出了苦招，每天将油箱内的柴油抽出，拎回家保管，第二天再倒进油箱，好让贼扑空。不想这次抽油被人撞个正着，本是防偷油，结果被人误会成偷油贼了。无奈之举有隐患三台车抽一次油要个把小时“要不是柴油看紧，我才不愿意这么辛苦天天抽油回家储存。”王师傅说，自己在工地上干活，每天一早就要到工地，晚上6点才能收工，一家收入就全靠这三辆车子，工程车、吊车要是没油那就等同一堆废铜烂铁，自己一家的收入也就黄了。上次三辆车柴油被偷，损失了2000多元加油费，三辆车还都抛锚在路边。之后，他求爷爷告奶奶的，花了两个小时才跟同行借到了点柴油，勉强将三辆车开到附近一处加油站，到晚上才加到油，工地上的活全被耽搁了。一天活没干成，钱也没挣到，还被工地老板臭骂了一顿，这让他气愤不已。为了确保工地正常开工，王师傅每天下工时，第一件事就是加油，每次加油排队，少则三个小时，多则五个小时，辛苦加回来的柴油，要是给小偷偷走就太痛心了，所以才下定决心，就是再苦也要将油箱内的柴油抽出，然后拖回家。“三辆车油箱能装三百升柴油，全部抽出来至少要花一个小时，得6个50升的油桶才能装得下。”王师傅说，抽油是一件费事的活，刚开始，自己用皮管抽油，但是得要嘴巴吸，保不住就会喝上一口柴油，让自己直犯恶心。后来抽油方法有所改良，用上了自制的一只简易抽油泵。简易抽油泵跟以前打酱油的工具差不多，靠人力操作，非常费力。“这点苦还不算，每天抽油装入6只油桶后，还得用面包车拉回家，第二天还得再拉回头灌进油箱。”王师傅夫妇希望柴油荒早点结束，自己好不再吃这种多余的苦。王师傅每天辛苦地将柴油抽出，然后拖回家中保存，那么柴油存放在民房内会不会有危险？记者就此采访了南京消防。消防人员告诉记者，柴油易燃不易爆，大部分柴油闪点高于60℃，而且它并不在《危险化学品名录》中，因此它不属于危险化学品，但大量囤积肯定是不允许的，而用铁质容器少量存放并不属于违法行为。但是柴油毕竟是易燃物，还是具有一定的危险性，万一起火，那后果就不堪设想。所以，王师傅最好不要将柴油搬回家储存。消防人员还告诉记者，柴油虽然属重油，但有时里面混有轻油成分，特别是有些小炼油厂或个体炼油点炼制的柴油，其成分不符合标准，往往混有轻质油的成分。这些物质易挥发成气体，一旦遇到明火就会燃烧，达到爆炸极限引发爆炸，万一家中储存这种柴油，无疑就是将“定时炸弹”搬回家。　曹卢杰文/摄	张先生,王某,王师傅,曹卢杰	正向	"The car owner spent one hour every day to draw out the diesel and take it home to prevent it from being stolen. Last night around 10 p.m., a citizen reported to the police that a couple was stealing diesel from the diesel tank of an engineering vehicle on the roadside of Chunjiang Street in Nanjing with a homemade oil pump. The police arrived at the scene quickly and found it was a misunderstanding. The man and woman were the owners of the engineering truck. Recently, it was difficult to add diesel, and the thief often visited to steal the oil from their truck. They are really afraid of being stolen, and they have no choice but to come up with a clumsy anti-theft method, drawing the diesel in the fuel tank every day, carrying it home for the night, and pouring it back into the fuel tank in the morning. Though it was troublesome, I felt relieved when I went to bed after coming back home every day. It was a false alarm. Someone stole the diesel from the construction vehicle. Nanjing Chunjiang Street has wide roads, and the slow lanes on both sides of the road have become free parking lots. There are a large number of trucks, cranes, and construction vehicles parked here every evening. At 10 pm the previous night, Mr. Zhang drove to Chunjiang Street to look for a parking space, and found a man holding a homemade oil pump, drawing diesel from the fuel tank of an engineering vehicle, and all the diesel drawn flowed into a flat iron oil drum. There was a woman by the man's side, constantly looking around, and sometimes urging the man to speed up with the oil. Soon, the diesel in the engineering vehicle's fuel tank was sucked dry. The couple sealed the diesel that was pumped out and quickly stuffed it into a van. There are few gas stations with diesel recently, and even if there are gas stations with diesel, vehicles are lined up in long queues and it takes a few hours to get fuel. That couple came out to smoke diesel oil in the middle of the night, and their actions were strange, as if they were stealing diesel oil. Mr. Zhang said that he did not think much and called 110 to report the crime. We were wrong to think that we were preventing the theft of diesel oil. The 110 police officers arrived to patrol Chunjiang Street. The man and woman did not try to avoid the police car when they saw it from a distance, but continued to draw diesel oil. This ""reckless"" scene also surprised the police. The police verified the identity information of the man and woman and the vehicle information, and the result was that it was a misunderstanding. This couple was not a thief, they were the owner of the engineering vehicle, and they drew the oil in the fuel tank to prevent thieves from stealing oil. Behind the scare was helplessness. According to Wang Mou, a man, he was working on a construction site in Nanjing, and in addition to two engineering vehicles, he also had a small crane. With diesel in short supply recently, he would have his workers fill up all three cars with fuel every day before he went home from work. In this way, we can start working on time after getting up in the morning, and will not delay the schedule. But five days ago, when Master Wang started his car after breakfast, he found that there was not much diesel left on the crane's dashboard. How could the oil added the previous night be gone? Master Wang got off the car to check the fuel tank, which showed no damage, but the fuel tank was empty. Only then did he realize that he had been robbed. Master Wang was very annoyed and hurriedly checked the fuel tanks of the other two engineering vehicles, only to find that the fuel tanks of the engineering vehicles had also been emptied. Not only did we lose more than two thousand yuan in fuel costs, but the work for the day at the construction site was also ruined. Master Wang reported the police at that time. The police made a record and began an investigation upon arrival. Not long after the oil theft case in front of it had not yet been solved, the thief also paid attention to the oil tank of his own crane, and lost a box of diesel oil again, delaying one day's construction period. The Wang couple came up with a desperate measure after being robbed so many times: they would empty the diesel in the fuel tank every day, take it home to keep, and pour it back into the fuel tank the next day, so that the thieves would be disappointed. Not wanting to be caught pumping oil this time, what was originally meant to prevent oil theft was misunderstood as an oil thief. An impromptu measure with hidden dangers, it takes a few hours to draw oil for three cars at a time. ""If it weren't for the diesel being watched closely, I wouldn't be willing to go through so much trouble to draw oil every day and store it at home."" Master Wang said that he had to go to the construction site early every morning and could only finish work at 6 p.m. That the income of his family depended on these three vehicles, and that the engineering vehicle and the crane would be nothing but scrap metal if they ran out of fuel, and that the income of his family would be lost. Last time, three cars had their diesel stolen, losing over 2000 yuan in fuel costs, and all three cars broke down by the roadside. Then he begged his grandparents and finally borrowed some diesel fuel from a fellow worker after two hours. He managed to drive the three cars to a nearby gas station and filled them with fuel only by night, and the work on the construction site was delayed. He failed to accomplish anything in a day, didn't earn any money, and was even verbally abused by the construction site boss, which made him extremely angry. To ensure that the construction site could start work normally, Master Wang, as soon as he finished work every day, would go to refuel. Each time he refueled, it would take at least three hours, and sometimes up to five hours. It was too heartbreaking to have the diesel fuel that he had worked hard to get stolen, so he made up his mind to draw the diesel fuel in the fuel tank and then drag it home, no matter how hard it was. Three cars' fuel tanks can hold 300 liters of diesel, and it will take at least an hour to empty them. Six 50-liter drums are needed to hold all the fuel. Master Wang said that drawing oil was a troublesome job. At the beginning, he used a leather hose to draw oil, but he had to suck it with his mouth. He would drink a mouthful of diesel and feel sick. Later, the oil was extracted with a homemade simple oil pump. The simple oil pump is similar to the tools used to buy soy sauce before, which relies on manual operation and is very laborious. This is not the worst part; after pumping oil into six barrels every day, I have to drive them home in a minivan, and then drive them back the next day to refill the fuel tank. Mr. Wang and his wife hope that the diesel shortage will end soon so that they can stop enduring this unnecessary hardship. Is it safe to store diesel in a residential building, with Master Wang working hard to extract diesel every day and then dragging it home to save? The journalist interviewed Nanjing Fire Department on this issue. Firefighters told the reporters that diesel is flammable but not explosive, and most of the diesel has a flash point above 60℃. Moreover, it is not listed in the Catalogue of Hazardous Chemicals, so it does not belong to hazardous chemicals. However, large-scale storage is definitely not allowed, and storing a small amount in iron containers does not constitute a violation of the law. But diesel is flammable, and it still has a certain degree of danger. If it catches fire, the consequences will be unimaginable. So, Master Wang should not take the diesel oil home for storage. The firefighters also told the reporters that, although diesel is a heavy oil, it sometimes contains light oil components, especially the diesel produced by some small oil refineries or individual oil refining points, which do not meet the standard and often contain components of light oil. These substances are volatile and will burn when they encounter an open flame, causing an explosion when they reach the explosive limit. If there is such diesel stored at home, it is equivalent to bringing a ""time bomb"" home. Cao Lujie wrote and took the photos."
山寨机成国产手机品质突破绊脚石□本版文、图时报记者杨章玉上周六，金立通信董事长刘立荣在深圳接受时报采访时表示，当前国产手机与洋品牌最大的差距在于品牌，并称国产手机应以品质来突破品牌差距，同时强调当前国产手机以品质突破品牌的最大障碍是山寨机的存在。针对当前手机行业竞争激烈的现状，刘立荣认为，手机行业是一个巨大的可持续行业，手机毛利率最高仍可达50%，厂家只要有优异的产品和突出的经营，仍可在市场上获利不菲。在谈及金立自身时，刘立荣强调，金立不会追求漂亮的销量数据，而是会追求利益的最大化。他透露，金立今年的销量目标锁定800万台，产品策略仍以中端为主，不会下沉到低端市场。品牌成最大差距时报记者：国产手机发展到现在，你觉得它与洋品牌的最大差距是什么？刘立荣：国产手机与洋品牌相比，最大的差距还是在品牌上。我认为国产手机非常不幸，现在很多中高端消费者根本就不去接触国产手机，他们中间买洋品牌手机的居多，其实现在很多国产手机的功能和性价比已经很不错，质量也已做上来。记者：你认为中高端消费者不去接触国产手机的原因是什么？刘立荣：主要有两方面的原因：第一，内地消费者比一些发达地区的消费者更爱面子，他们总觉得买国外品牌的手机比较有面子；第二，由于几年前洋品牌手机质量较国产手机好，吸引了很多中高端消费者，他们已经习惯了某一洋品牌的固有功能和操作界面，再换其他品牌的手机，他们会觉得不太习惯。当然，一些追求手机时尚的消费者除外。严控品质求突破时报记者：在这种情况下，国产手机应该如何扭转消费者的这种习惯，让他们改用国产手机？刘立荣：对国产手机来讲，只有一个突破口，那就是严格把关手机产品的品质，而且是要持续下去；除此之外，也要注重手机产品的人性化设计，使消费者对手机的使用能轻易上手。国产手机千万不能像国产手机行业刚起步的2001年及2002年，当时很多国内消费者改过来买国产手机试一试，可惜当时国产手机只注重销量而没有注重品质，使这批具有经济实力并第一次购买国产手机的消费者大失所望，转而转向购买质量相对较好的洋品牌手机。因此当时国产手机卖得越多，损害的消费者也越多，对国产手机的品牌损害就越大。我认为对国产手机来说，是“前人砍树，后人只能开发”，我们只能一步一个脚印走，树立自己的品牌，逐步靠时间去改变国内消费者的看法。时报记者：金立在手机品质方面有没有什么具体的要求？刘立荣：我们一直非常注重手机产品的品质，并以“金品质，立天下”来要求自己，力图使手机产品的品质不断提高，使更多的消费者使用或再次使用金立手机。	杨章玉,金立,刘立荣	正向	"Clones are a stumbling block to the quality breakthrough of domestic mobile phones□Reporter Yang Zhangyu of the Southern Metropolis Daily reported that last Saturday, Liu Lirong, chairman of Golden Field Communication, said in an interview with the Southern Metropolis Daily in Shenzhen that the biggest gap between domestic mobile phones and foreign brands is brand, and said that domestic mobile phones should break the brand gap with quality, and at the same time emphasized that the biggest obstacle to the quality breakthrough of domestic mobile phones is the existence of clones. In view of the fierce competition in the mobile phone industry at present, Liu Lirong believes that the mobile phone industry is a huge and sustainable industry, and the gross profit margin of mobile phones can still reach 50%. As long as the manufacturers have excellent products and outstanding management, they can still make a lot of profits in the market. When it comes to Gionee itself, Liu Lirong stressed that Gionee would not pursue beautiful sales data, but would pursue the maximization of interests. He revealed that the sales target for Kingmax this year is set at 8 million units, and the product strategy will still focus on mid-range products, and will not sink to the low-end market. Reporter of the Times: What do you think is the biggest gap between domestic mobile phones and foreign brands now that they have developed to the present? Liu Lirong: The biggest difference between domestic mobile phones and foreign brands is still in the brand. I think the domestic mobile phones are very unfortunate. Now, many middle and high-end consumers do not even touch domestic mobile phones. Most of them buy foreign brand mobile phones. In fact, the functions and cost-effectiveness of many domestic mobile phones are already very good, and the quality has also been improved. The reporter asked, what do you think is the reason that the middle and high-end consumers do not contact domestic mobile phones? Liu Lirong: There are two main reasons: First, consumers in the mainland are more concerned about face than those in some developed regions, and they always feel that buying foreign brand mobile phones is more face-saving; Second, because foreign brand mobile phones were of better quality than domestic brand mobile phones a few years ago, they attracted many middle and high-end consumers. They have already gotten used to the fixed functions and operation interface of a certain foreign brand, and they will feel uncomfortable when they switch to other brand mobile phones. Of course, except for some consumers who pursue the fashion of mobile phones. With quality control and breakthroughs, how should domestic mobile phones turn around consumers' habits and make them switch to domestic mobile phones? A reporter from the Beijing Times asked. Liu Lirong: For domestic mobile phones, there is only one breakthrough, that is, to strictly control the quality of mobile phone products, and it must be sustained; apart from that, they should also pay attention to the humanized design of mobile phone products, so that consumers can easily get started with the use of mobile phones. Domestic mobile phones must not be like domestic mobile phone industry in its early days in 2001 and 2002, when many domestic consumers switched to buy domestic mobile phones to try. Unfortunately, at that time, domestic mobile phones only focused on sales and did not focus on quality, which disappointed a batch of consumers with economic power and first-time purchase of domestic mobile phones, and turned to buy relatively better quality foreign brand mobile phones. Thus, the more domestic mobile phones were sold at that time, the more consumers were harmed, and the damage to the brand of domestic mobile phones was greater. I think for domestic mobile phones, it is ""the previous generation cut the trees, and the next generation can only develop"". We can only take one step at a time, establish our own brand, and gradually change the views of domestic consumers with time.

A+H股多弱势续跌AH溢价率稳守于两成上方新浪财经讯01月25日消息，A+H股两市继续呈现跌多涨少的弱势局面；恒生AH股溢价指数微增0.09点至121.1点；今日收市后倒挂个股增至八只。周末淡静度过，上周五借助加息预期下金融股单日转向之威而触底反弹中港股市，今日盘中的反攻力度顿显乏力。深沪A股及港市H股即市低开后虽一度携手收复跌幅，惟受制于调控趋紧下后续跟进筹码不足，股指随后逐步丧失早市升势，全天收盘AH股指同步收跌约1%。全日A股部分成交大幅萎缩至只有约160亿元(人民币，A股下同)；H股部分成交也显著缩小至约171亿元(港元，H股下同)。加息预期未见监管层“响应”，金融股普遍回吐。中国银行(601988-CN;03988-HK)披露400亿元A股可转债计划并寻求股东授权增发AH股，市场忧虑其集资计划出台或掀同业“抽水”序幕，AH股跌0.5%及2.1%；AH股溢价率(考虑最新汇率因素：1港元兑换0.87833元人民币)略为缩小至24%。石油类股也追随国际油价的跌势而小幅回调。金属资源、电力类股A强H弱；公路、海运、建材及环保类股则多H涨A跌，中和两市价差率的扩大效应。航空股则两市跌幅可观。附今日收盘后AH股溢价率最小的十只个股∶个股简称及代码-------------------AH溢价率中国太保(601601-CN;02601-HK)-----(-10.51%)中国平安(601318-CN;02318-HK)------(-9.37%)中国人寿(601628-CN;02628-HK)------(-6.14%)鞍钢股份(000898-CN;00347-HK)------(-4.25%)中国神华(601088-CN;01088-HK)------(-1.67%)工商银行(601398-CN;01398-HK)------(-1.43%)青岛啤酒(600600-CN;00168-HK)------(-1.36%)中国铁建(601186-CN;01186-HK)------(-1.23%)海螺水泥(600585-CN;00914-HK)--------1.36%招商银行(600036-CN;03968-HK)--------1.75%		正向	"A+H shares continued to fall, and the A+H premium rate remained above 20%. Sina Finance News, January 25, 2022, A+H shares continued to show a weak situation with more declines than increases; the Hang Seng A+H premium index increased by 0.09 points to 121.1 points; the number of inverted stocks after the market closed increased to eight. The weekend was quiet, and the Hong Kong and mainland stock markets rebounded from the bottom on Friday, taking advantage of the single-day turnaround of financial stocks under the expectation of interest rate hikes. However, the offensive force in the afternoon trading today has become weak. Shenhu A-shares and Hong Kong H-shares opened lower but recovered losses briefly, but due to insufficient follow-up shares under tighter regulation, the index gradually lost its morning gains, closing down about 1% for both A and H-shares for the day. The A-share turnover shrank significantly to about 16 billion yuan (A-share); the turnover of H-shares also shrank significantly to about 17.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (H-share). With no response from the regulatory authorities to the expectation of interest rate hikes, financial stocks generally gave back their gains. China Construction Bank (601988-CN; 03988-HK) disclosed a 40 billion yuan A-share convertible bond plan and sought shareholder authorization to increase the issuance of A and H shares. The market was concerned that the fundraising plan would trigger a ""water extraction"" by peers, and the A and H shares fell by 0.5% and 2.1%, respectively. The A and H share premium rate (considering the latest exchange rate factor: 1 Hong Kong dollar = 0.87833 yuan) narrowed slightly to 24%. Crude oil stocks also fell slightly in line with the decline in international oil prices. Metal resources and power stocks A strong H weak; highway, maritime, building materials and environmental protection stocks are mostly H up A down, offsetting the effect of widening the price difference between the two markets. The aviation stocks saw significant declines in both markets.

Zhongzou Vanke Jinyu Huafu is about to open. Vanke Group, as a leader in the real estate industry, has its own product system. Any new real estate development will give customers a reason to buy, with the core of the entire design plan being to meet customer needs, establish the core selling points of the product, i.e., product, quality, and integrity. Vanke's ""Golden"" series of premium residences is committed to refining the details of daily life and creating a sense of belonging with a mature cultural atmosphere. With a more avant-garde and modern concept of superior living in the central area, it guides the new fashion of urban living. This time, Xicheng went north, and Vanke Group took on the construction of Xicheng's population relief resettlement houses, and together with Zhuzong, it acquired 550,000 square meters of land in Dong Shangdi to build a large-scale project - Zhuzong Vanke · Jinyi Huafu. Vanke set it as the ""golden"" series products, mainly to create a dedicated residence for IT elites in the Zhongguancun and Shang region, to improve their living environment and alleviate the housing pressure in these areas. According to the statistics in 2010, the supply of residential properties in the core area of Zhongguancun was only 4.5 million square meters. The land resources were scarce and the supply was too small, and the ""pure"" residential projects were extremely scarce. The area to the east of Shangdi is relatively quiet, suitable for living, and is not far from Zhongguancun, with convenient transportation. Lines 13, 8 and Changping can all reach the core business districts of Zhongguancun, Guoao, Financial Street, etc. conveniently. If you drive yourself, you can also reach the above places by Jingzang Expressway and Jingbao Expressway, which is called ""three tracks and two highways, three-dimensional transportation"". Vanke's executive even referred to the Zhutong Vanke · Jinyi Huafu project as a ""thunderbolt in the real estate market"". In his view, the area of Shangdi East where the project is located is close to the Shangdi High-tech Park and the area of high-level universities, and it can accommodate many international well-known high-tech industries such as Lenovo, Baidu, and Fangzheng. At the same time, it is adjacent to the Xicheng district in Shangdi East, and it can enjoy the high-quality education of Xicheng district. It comprehensively demonstrates the two major advantages of the IT circle and educational facilities in the Jingbei area. And with the protection of two well-known brands, Zhetong and Vanke, the project itself perfectly interprets the life of urban elites. The project adheres to Vanke's一贯standard of finished decoration for delivery, with flexible space and high utilization rate. With the unique ""dual-core"" spatial planning and landscape design, the building and landscape are organically integrated, and the distance between buildings reaches 130 meters. And in the garden design, a growth park for children was created, which will set up graffiti walls, glass plaques, Disciple Regulations, Milky Way Solar System, world map, Three Character Classic, etc. for children to play, of course, there are also facilities suitable for different age groups to relax and entertain, which reflects the care for the whole life cycle. Here, you can find a corner of silence in the hustle and bustle, and enjoy a touch of seclusion in the prosperity, striving for a beautiful and comfortable living environment. The project has a wide range of high-quality medical resources, including PLA No. 309 Hospital, Huilongguan Hospital, Qinghe Hospital, etc., which are convenient for medical treatment and physical examination. There are also good places for eating, drinking, playing, and having fun, such as Eon International Mall, Xing Mei Shopping Mall, Xidan Shopping Mall Huilongguan Mall, and Huazhong Department Store, all of which are located near the project. Phase one of the Zhutong Vanke Jinyu Huafu project mainly promotes two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments ranging from 85 to 105 square meters. 1000 units of housing are released at once. The model room and garden demonstration area have already been opened. The project is scheduled to be launched in June, and it can be combined with a loan. The reception center is 500 meters northwest of the Hui Long Guan Bridge on the Badaling Expressway. I want to comment on the property navigation:"

广东大翻盘让阿联高呼骄傲杜比超强能力令他感叹新浪体育讯　北京时间4月18日消息，在结束了NBA的常规赛之后，易建联立刻马不停蹄的赶回了国内，并且向国家队的主教练邓华德报道，并且和邓华德进行了一次神秘会谈。不过易建联并不会马上和国家队会合一起训练，接下来他将休息半个月，而在这半个月当中，为自己曾经效力的广东队助威总决赛也成为了他日程中最为重要的事情。昨晚，广东队在新疆客场一度落后18分的情况下在第四节上演了惊心动魄的大翻盘，已经抵达北京的易建联也在电视机旁关注了这场比赛。“我看了第二场。”易建联说，“对广东来说，他们打得非常不错，我为他们感到骄傲。昨天的比赛他们第二节一度落后16分，第三节的时候甚至落后了18分，但大家在困难时刻都没有放弃，最后还是赢回来了。我希望他们后面的比赛能够打出更好的表现。”谈到广东队总决赛上的对手新疆队，易建联表示：“新疆队这个赛季确实实力提高了很多，包括内援方面、外援方面，还有替补的实力。应该说总决赛对双方来说都会是一个很大的挑战。”在关注了总决赛前两场之后，阿联也为昆西-杜比超强的得分能力而感叹。他说：“杜比在新疆队确实扮演了一个非常重要的角色，第一场让他拿了53分，确实是对他这一点控制得不太好。第二场让他拿到36分，这就是他常规赛一直保持的一个正常水平，所以对他的控制应该说还是有所提高吧。后面的比赛，防守杜比仍然会是球队的重点任务。”当记者提出让易建联预测一下总决赛的比分时，阿联笑了表说：“预测我还没有想过，因为我会有偏爱，广东是我以前效力的球队，我肯定会更加支持广东。”虽然不愿意对比分做出具体的预测，但阿联还是对后面的比赛进行了展望，他说：“从实力上看，谁能拿最后的总冠军还要看双方的发挥和临场的表现。现在两支球队都各输了一个主场，后面的每一场比赛对双方来说都非常重要。”最后，阿联也对广东队本赛季的表现做出了总结。易建联说：“这个赛季广东队经历了很多的困难，包括朱芳雨和王仕鹏几个老将身上一直有伤，而且大外援(哈里森)也在赛季刚刚开始就受伤了，应该说他们常规赛打得非常不容易，但这这种困难的情况下他们还是打出了非常不错的表现。”接下来，易建联将会前往东莞，观看本赛季的CBA总决赛第四场，并为自己的母队——广东队加油。(贾磊)	阿联,杜比,易建联,邓华德,昆西-杜比,朱芳雨,王仕鹏,哈里森,贾磊	正向	"Guangdong's comeback made Yi Jianlian shout proudly, and Du Bin's super ability made him sigh. Sina Sports News, April 18, Beijing time, after the end of the NBA regular season, Yi Jianlian immediately rushed back to the country and reported to the national team coach, and had a mysterious talk with Deng Hua. But Yi Jianlian will not join the national team for training immediately. In the next half a month, he will rest, and cheering for the final of the team he used to play for, Guangdong, has become the most important thing on his schedule. Last night, Guangdong team staged a thrilling comeback in the fourth quarter after falling 18 points behind in Xinjiang away game, and Yi Jianlian, who had already arrived in Beijing, watched the game on the TV. I watched the second one. Yi Jianlian said, ""For Guangdong, they played very well, and I am proud of them."" They were 16 points behind in the second period of yesterday's game, and even 18 points behind in the third period, but they didn't give up in the difficult moments, and finally came back. I hope they can play better in their next match. When it comes to the Xinjiang team, Yi Jianlian said, ""The Xinjiang team has indeed improved a lot in this season, including the strength of the domestic players, the strength of the foreign players, and the strength of the substitutes."" It should be said that the final will be a great challenge for both sides. After watching the first two finals games, Zhou Yuan was also amazed by Du Bi's strong scoring ability. He said, ""Dubi did play a very important role in Xinjiang team. In the first game, he got 53 points, which was indeed not well controlled in this aspect."" The second game, he scored 36 points, which is a normal level he has maintained in the regular season, so his control should have improved. In the following games, defending DuBo will still be the team's top priority. When the reporter asked Yi Jianlian to predict the final score, he smiled and said, ""I haven't thought about predicting, because I have a preference. Guangdong is the team I used to play for, so I will definitely support Guangdong more."" Although unwilling to make specific predictions about the final score, Alain still looked forward to the games to come, saying, ""From the strength, who can win the final championship still depends on the performance and the performance of both sides on the spot. Now both teams have lost one home game, and every game after that is very important to both sides. Finally, Ah Lian also made a summary of Guangdong team's performance in this season. Yi Jianlian said, ""Guangdong team has experienced a lot of difficulties this season, including the old players such as Zhou Fangyuan and Wang Shipeng, who have been injured, and the big foreign player (Harrison) was injured at the beginning of the season. It can be said that they have played very hard in the regular season, but they still performed very well in such difficult situations. Next, Yi Jianlian will go to Dongguan to watch the fourth game of the CBA final of this season and cheer for his home team - Guangdong team. (Jialei)"
topview：股市将如何发展指南针姜都锋昨日中国股市经历了从跌3%到涨3%的逆转，全球股市也在各国救市的利好前提下出现了好转，香港恒生指数大涨10%，新加坡海峡时报指数大涨5%，英国融时报指数大涨8.26%，德国DAX30种股价指数大涨11.%。而美国道琼斯指数更是创下历史最高单日上涨点数，上涨了936点，涨幅11%。在全球股市普涨的局面下，我国又会向何处出发展呢？通过指南针赢富数据显示，上周周五基金大举建仓，当日建仓资金净流入24.81亿。资产管理机构也将一味的做空变成了少量的调仓。应该说这一动作说明阳光机构对后市是比较乐观的。从指南针动态TOP显示，本周一主力资金仍在大举的建仓中国股市，加之大盘连续下跌，昨日大盘发生惊天大逆转也就是正常了。指南针TOP板大盘风向标显示资金的进场数量和持续性都达到了近期的巨量。可以看到，大盘风向标中显示资金已经达到了1天、3天、5天、10天全部做多的状态。那么当全球股市全部大涨，中国股市资金大举介入的时候，未来大盘的方向将怎么走呢？应该说盲目的乐观是不应该的。我们应该看到当前行情的主要趋势是震荡行情，行情趋势的改变首先是要有资金的改变。通过指南针动态TOP软件的显示，今日(周二)大盘风向标出现了主力资金却在大涨之后出逃的迹象，看来主力对未来的行情并不是十分看好。才出现了今天主力逢高派发的动作。	姜都锋	正向	Topview: Guide to how the stock market will develop. The Chinese stock market experienced a reversal from a 3% drop to a 3% rise yesterday, and the global stock market also showed improvement under the favorable conditions of various countries' rescue measures. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rose by 10%, the Straits Times Index in Singapore rose by 5%, the FTSE Index in the UK rose by 8.26%, and the DAX 30 stock price index in Germany rose by 11%. And the Dow Jones Index in the United States even set a record for the largest single-day point increase, rising by 936 points, or 11%. With the global stock market on the rise, where will China go? According to Feng data from the compass, last Friday funds were heavily positioned, with a net inflow of 2.481 billion yuan on that day. Asset management institutions have also turned one-sided short selling into a small adjustment in the portfolio. It should be said that this action indicates that the Sunshine Institution is optimistic about the future market. From the dynamic TOP display of the compass, the main force capital was still heavily accumulating the Chinese stock market this Monday, and the big reversal of the market yesterday was also normal given the continuous decline of the market. The compass TOP board large wind vane shows that the number and persistence of funds entering the market have reached a recent large volume. It can be seen that the market wind vane shows that funds have reached the state of being long for 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, and 10 days. So when the global stock market is booming and a large amount of funds are entering the Chinese stock market, how will the direction of the future market be? Blind optimism should not be encouraged. We should see the main trend of the current market as a sideways market, and the change in market trends first requires a change in capital. Through the dynamic TOP software display of the compass, the market trend indicator of the main market today (Tuesday) showed signs of the main force funds fleeing after a sharp rise, indicating that the main force is not very optimistic about the future market trend. Only today's main force selling off at higher prices has appeared.
猛龙新秀挤走功勋老臣马刺领衔5球队追求欧洲之王新浪体育讯　北京时间6月28日，据《环球邮报》消息，猛龙在选秀大会上挑走了德马尔-德罗赞后，队中元老安东尼-帕克已经没有了位置，他离队的可能性很大。目前已经有多支球队追逐帕克。帕克在7月1日即将成为自由球员，他已经34岁，是一位经验丰富的得分后卫。帕克上一份3年1200万的合同今年到期，他希望在职业生涯的晚期，得到一份尽可能大的合同。一位内部人士透露，至少有5支球队向猛龙就帕克进行了询价，包括马刺，凯尔特人，太阳，骑士和雷霆。就现在的情况看，帕克找到新东家不是难事。猛龙已经向新秀德罗赞许诺了出场时间，他们还向德尔菲诺开出报价合同。另外帕克回到欧洲联赛的可能性也很大。帕克在最初几个NBA不成功的赛季，前往欧洲淘金，却在以色列联赛取得生工，入选欧洲联赛50大巨星，并连续两赛季拿到MVP，被称为欧洲之王。(迪哥)	德马尔-德罗赞,德罗赞,安东尼-帕克,帕克,德尔菲诺,迪哥	正向	The new recruit of the Raptors has pushed out the veteran hero of the Spurs, leading five teams to pursue the king of Europe. According to the news of Sina Sports, on June 28, the Raptors picked up DeMar DeRozan in the draft, and the veteran Anthony Parker in the team has no position, and he is very likely to leave the team. Several teams are already pursuing Parker. Parker will become a free agent on July 1, and he is a 34-year-old veteran shooting guard. Parker's last three-year, $12 million contract expires this year, and he hopes to get a bigger contract in his late career. An insider revealed that at least five teams inquired about Parker from the Raptors, including the Spurs, Celtics, Suns, Cavaliers, and Thunder. Given the current situation, it won't be difficult for Parker to find a new club. The Raptors have promised playing time to the rookie DeRozan and have offered a contract to Delphino. There is also a good chance that Park will return to the European league. Parker went to Europe to seek his fortune after several unsuccessful NBA seasons, but he succeeded in the Israeli league, was selected as one of the 50 greatest stars in the European league, and won the MVP award for two consecutive seasons, earning the title of King of Europe.

新疆警方：高考招生5大陷阱需设防6月27日，乌鲁木齐市公安局发出预警提醒高考考生和家长：警惕五大陷阱、谨防上当受骗。一、招生陷阱针对家长都希望自己的孩子能进名校就读的心理，骗子往往设置4类陷阱：“名校”变“民办”。骗子通常许诺可以让高三毕业生到名校学习，但在接受“关系费”、“赞助费”后，却将学生安排到交钱就能上的民办高校；“艺校”变“艺班”。骗子吹嘘可以帮助考生进入艺校，从而骗取高额“好处费”，最后却将学生送进私人开办的艺术辅导班。“军校”特招。骗子以部队首长亲属、朋友的身份自居，或者干脆自称高级军官，谎称手中握有某某军校的特招生名额，在收受钱财后溜之大吉。“点招”吸引。骗子利用考生和家长对试点高校“点招”政策不了解的弱点，极力渲染其中的“黑幕”，以帮助毕业生取得“点招”名额为名，实施诈骗。二、招工陷阱一些考生在高考之后即外出打工，针对这类学生，骗子常常以职业介绍所、职业中介人名义设置3类陷阱。收费不介绍：骗子收取毕业生高额打工介绍费后逃之夭夭；预留试用期：承诺给予高薪，以试用的名义廉价利用毕业生的劳动力；乱收费：编造各种名义收取费用，如风险抵押金、培训费、置装费、建档费等。三、网络陷阱学生参加高考后，上网的时间多了，但对是非的辨别、对不良信息的抵制能力相对较弱，易沉迷于网络色情。四、“哥们儿”陷阱现在的高三毕业生多为“90后”，具有强烈的好奇心，易冲动，高考后，管理上也处于“放羊”状态。此时，一些高三毕业生误交不良社会青年，并为了“哥们儿”义气，做出寻衅滋事、聚众斗殴等违法行为。五、传销陷阱骗子往往以高三毕业生的亲朋好友或老乡面目出现，鼓动毕业生利用等待录取通知书的时间赚大钱，以高额回报、快速致富为诱饵，进行诱骗。针对这五种情况，公安机关在加强打击违法犯罪分子的同时，提醒广大家长、考生：首先，要通过正常渠道报考高校，不给不法分子以可乘之机；其次，要认真甄别各类中介的真伪，不要“病急乱投医”；最后，家长要加强对考生的监管，防止其上当受骗及违法犯罪。		正向	"Xinjiang police: Beware of five traps in college entrance examination recruitment On June 27, the Public Security Bureau of Urumqi issued a warning to remind candidates and parents of the college entrance examination: be wary of five traps and be careful not to be cheated. One, admission scams target parents' desire for their children to attend a prestigious school, and scammers often set up four types of traps: ""prestigious schools"" turn into private schools. Scammers often promise that senior three graduates can study at top universities, but after accepting ""relationship fees"" and ""sponsoring fees"", they arrange for students to attend privately-run colleges that can be paid for; ""art schools"" become ""art classes"". Scammers boast of being able to help candidates enter art schools, and then send students to privately-run art tutoring classes after defrauding them of a large sum of ""bribe money"". Special recruitment for military academies. Scammers claim to be the relatives or friends of military commanders, or simply call themselves high-ranking officers, and lie that they have a special admission quota for a certain military school. After receiving money, they disappear. “Point and招” attract. Scammers take advantage of the lack of understanding among examinees and their parents about the ""point admission"" policy of pilot universities, exaggerate the ""secrets"" behind it, and carry out fraud under the guise of helping graduates obtain a ""point admission"" quota. Two, job hunting traps, some candidates go out to work after the college entrance examination, and fraudsters often set up three kinds of traps for such students under the guise of employment introduction offices and employment intermediaries. No introduction, only fees: scammers collect high job introduction fees from graduates and then disappear; Reserving probationary periods: promising high salaries and using the guise of probation to cheaply exploit the labor of graduates; Various fees: fabricating various names for fees, such as risk deposit, training fees, uniform fees, and file establishment fees. III. Internet Traps After students take the college entrance examination, they have more time to surf the Internet, but their ability to distinguish right from wrong and resist negative information is relatively weak, making them prone to becoming addicted to online pornography. IV. ""Bro"" Trap Now, most of the senior three graduates are ""90s"", with a strong sense of curiosity, prone to impulsiveness, and are in a ""sheep herding"" state after the college entrance examination in terms of management. At this time, some senior three graduates mistakenly associate with bad social youths, and in the name of ""brotherhood"", they commit acts of provocation, group fighting, and other illegal behaviors. Five, pyramid scheme con artists often appear as the relatives and friends or fellow townspeople of senior three graduates, inciting graduates to make a lot of money by taking advantage of the time waiting for admission notices, using high returns and quick wealth as bait, and deceiving them. In addition to strengthening the crackdown on criminal and illegal elements, public security organs remind parents and candidates of the following five situations: First, they should register for higher education through normal channels, so as not to give illegal elements an opportunity; second, they should carefully distinguish the authenticity of various intermediaries, and do not ""seek medical treatment in a hurry""; finally, parents should strengthen the supervision of candidates to prevent them from being cheated and committing crimes and illegal acts."
京城高中“出国班”开设中国文化课北京考试报讯在京城部分示范高中国际班上，学生除了学习国际课程，中国文化课也是很重要的一部分。据悉，在京城的高中“出国班”几乎都开设了中国文化课。北大附中国际部国际课程与中国文化课并重，除国际课程外，中国语言及文学、中国历史及政治等课程，学生也要学。十一学校国际部的学生同样要学历史、地理等课程。首师大附中中美实验班的学生可在艺术、语言与文学、人文与社会等五大学习领域选修申请美国大学所需课程。“出国学生要了解世界文化艺术的基本常识，但不能忘记中国历史、地理的基本知识。”在四中、八中等示范高中的“出国班”里，为了让学生更有针对性地准备出国考试，学校特意为学生量身定做了相关课程。学校除安排数学、语文等基础课、会考课程外，还额外开设中西艺术鉴赏、中国历史和地理等课程。十一学校国际部副主任周斌说，中国文化是学生的根。国际部要招收“志在出国”的优秀学生，把他们培养成国际型人才。同时，学生只有学习中国文化，将来走出国门后，才能更好传播祖国优秀文化。连自己国家、民族的历史、文化都不了解，出国何以立足。业内人士认为，高中开展中外合作教育，适应了时代发展的需要。再过几年，一流人才应是具有“国际化背景、世界眼光、中国灵魂”的人物。据了解，示范高中里的“出国班”有两种，一种是根据学生和家长需求，在高三时为留学生单独设置，班上的高三生基本只参加会考申请国外高校；另一种是国际班。高中与国外中学合作或引进国外中学课程。学生从高一便学习国外课程，高三毕业直接申请国外高校。部分高中两种班兼有。(记者：马海丽)	周斌,马海丽	正向	"Beijing High School ""Overseas Class"" Offers Chinese Culture CourseBeijing Examination Daily讯在北京部分示范高中国际班上，除了学习国际课程，中国文化课也是很重要的一部分。 It is reported that almost all high schools in the capital city have Chinese culture classes for their ""overseas class"". The International Department of Beijing No.1 High School attaches equal importance to international courses and Chinese cultural courses. In addition to international courses, students also need to study Chinese language and literature, Chinese history and politics, etc. Students in the International Department of No.11 Middle School also have to study history, geography and other courses. Students in the SFC-USA Experimental Class at Capital Normal University High School can choose from courses required for applying to American universities in five major learning areas: art, language and literature, humanities and social sciences. Students going abroad should have basic knowledge of world art and culture, but they should not forget the basic knowledge of Chinese history and geography. In the ""overseas class"" of model high schools such as No. 4 High School and No. 8 High School, in order to enable students to prepare more targetedly for overseas exams, the school specially designed relevant courses for students. In addition to arranging basic courses and examination courses such as mathematics and Chinese, the school also offers courses in Chinese and foreign art appreciation, Chinese history and geography, etc. Zhou Bin, deputy director of the International Department of No. 11 School, said that Chinese culture is the root of the students. The International Department is recruiting excellent students who are determined to go abroad and cultivate them into international talents. Moreover, students can better promote the excellent culture of their motherland when they go abroad in the future after studying Chinese culture. If you do not understand the history and culture of your own country and nation, how can you stand on your own feet when you go abroad. It is believed by insiders that high schools conducting cooperative education with foreign countries meets the needs of the times. In a few years, top talents should be people with an ""international background, global vision, and Chinese soul."" There are two types of ""overseas classes"" in model high schools: one is set up for overseas students according to the needs of students and their parents, and the senior three students in the class basically only apply for foreign universities by taking the high school entrance examination; the other is an international class. High schools cooperate with or introduce foreign middle school courses. Students start to learn foreign courses in the first year of high school and apply to foreign universities directly after graduating from the third year of high school. Some senior high schools have both types of classes. (Reporter: Ma Haili)"

南钢四大主力仍拒绝续约高层辟谣：从没想拖合同作为南钢五虎将之一，4日晚上，杨力与俱乐部草签了新赛季合同。于是，网上传言，南钢剩余主力队员行将就范，本周内俱乐部将一一搞定所有合同。昨天，经过本报记者多方采访，得出的结果却与网上传言大相径庭，俱乐部与剩余四将的博弈仍在继续，双方都无让步迹象。这样下去，唐正东、胡雪峰、易立和孟达四大主力缺席新赛季首场与东莞的比赛不无可能。博弈继续球员没有妥协的意思昨天某网站报道，江苏几大主力球员已经准备向南钢俱乐部妥协，并引用了一名球员的话：“就这样一份合同放在你面前，你签不签？都到这时候了，你说我们还能怎么办？”文章说，俱乐部此前采取的“各个击破”和“消耗战”都在联赛开始前一周起到了效果，“都到这份上了，能不签吗？”在这样一种情况下，球员的无奈可想而知。文中还引用了南钢俱乐部总经理王敏的话：“目前就剩下三位主力的合同还没有签订，但我们谈得不错，应该说这两天全部球员就能够签约了。”文章称，无论球员有多么不情愿，他们黑笔写下的大名最终还是要落在那份在他们看来的“不平等条约”上。实际情况真的如网文说的那样吗？昨晚，记者分别拨通了几位当事球员的电话，得到的回答同样的斩钉截铁：“我们没有妥协的意思，如果不能与俱乐部就一些细节达成一致，新赛季的第一场比赛我们很可能不打了。”主力队员孟达的话代表了几位主力的态度：“我们也等着俱乐部来跟我们沟通，现在整个工资盘子已经定了，薪水我们也就不争论了。但比如伤病等不可抗拒因素的细节问题还要等待俱乐部的明确，成绩指标上我们也有分歧，如果大唐真得不打了，第三名的成绩指标我们肯定不能接受。”记者了解到，由于几位主力球员的态度比较坚决，南钢俱乐部相关领导昨天放弃了去南钢宾馆与球员谈判。而一些媒体报道的易立和胡雪峰基本接受俱乐部合同一说，并不确切。胡雪峰、易立和孟达三人与俱乐部关于合同的博弈仍在继续，如果劳资双方各不让步，几大主力缺席新赛季首场比赛不无可能，当然，这是我们极不情愿看到的一幕。高层喊冤王敏：“从没想过拖合同”昨天，网上的一篇文章激怒了南钢俱乐部总经理王敏，这篇网文说，俱乐部总经理王敏是一种胜利者的姿态，“我们争取这两三天与他们签约，我想一定会有一个不错的结果的。”该文还称，俱乐部方面多次找球员谈实际上就是个幌子，俱乐部的说法是，“你们签不签无所谓，最后大家还是可以做朋友的。”实际上就是给球员某种“高处不胜寒”的感觉。对于这种不负责任的说法，王敏予以了强烈谴责：“首先我要申明，俱乐部与球员包括教练组关于合同谈判的态度是诚恳的，合同拖到现在没有解决，俱乐部非常着急，根本不像一些媒体说的，俱乐部无所谓，等比赛开打了，球员自然签合同。“其次，我昨天下午还与易立、胡雪峰进行了沟通，尽管一些细节双方还有分歧，但俱乐部的态度很积极。球员的一些顾虑我们也理解，俱乐部内部也在协商，争取早日解决合同问题，毕竟联赛马上开打，再拖下去，势必影响南钢新赛季的成绩。最后，俱乐部接下来几天肯定要重点解决合同的问题，决不会任凭事情发展到影响首场比赛的程度。”明天，南钢俱乐部将举行新赛季新闻发布会，王总的期望是：“争取在发布会之前解决合同问题，让所有队员全身心地投入到新赛季中去。”本报记者刁勇	杨力,唐正东,胡雪峰,雪峰,易立,孟达,王敏,大唐,王总,刁勇	正向	"The four mainstays of Nansteel still refuse to renew their contracts. The upper management denied the rumors: as one of the five tigers of Nansteel, Yang Li signed a provisional contract for the new season on the evening of April 4. Then rumors spread online that Nansteel’s remaining main players would be signed up one by one, and the club would settle all the contracts within this week. Yesterday, after multiple interviews with the reporters of our newspaper, the results were quite different from the rumors on the Internet. The club and the remaining four players are still in a game, and neither side has shown any signs of compromise. It is not impossible that the four mainstays, Tang Zhengdong, Hu Xuefeng, Yi Li and Meng Da, will miss the first game of the new season against Dongguan. The game continued, and the players showed no sign of compromise. Yesterday, a website reported that several main players in Jiangsu were ready to compromise with Nansteel Club, and quoted a player as saying, ""Do you sign this contract in front of you or not?"" By now, what can we do? The article says that the club's previous ""divide and conquer"" and ""trench warfare"" tactics had already taken effect a week before the start of the league, ""With it this far, how could we not sign?"" In such a situation, it is easy to imagine the helplessness of the player. Wang Min, the general manager of Nansteel club, said in the article that there are only three main players whose contracts have not been signed yet, but we have been talking well, and we should be able to sign all the players in the next two days. The article states that, no matter how unwilling the players are, their big names written in black ink will eventually fall on what they see as an “unequal treaty.” Is it really as the online articles say? Last night, the reporters called several of the players involved, and the answer was the same: ""We have no intention of compromising. If we cannot reach an agreement with the club on some details, we may not play the first game of the new season."" The words of the main player Meng Da represented the attitude of several main players: ""We are also waiting for the club to communicate with us. Now the whole salary pool has been determined, so we will not argue about the salaries."" But the details of the uncontrollable factors such as injuries and illnesses still need to wait for the club to clarify, and we also have differences on the performance indicators. If Tangdang really doesn't play, we definitely cannot accept the third place performance indicator. Journalists learned that, due to the resolute attitude of several key players, Nansteel club's relevant leaders gave up on negotiating with the players at Nansteel hotel yesterday. And the reports that Yi Li and Hu Xuefeng basically accepted the club contract are not accurate. Hu Xuefeng, Yi Li and Meng Da are still in a game of contract with the club. If both sides of labor and capital do not give in, it is not impossible for the main players to miss the first game of the new season. Of course, this is a scene that we are unwilling to see. The senior management of Wang Min called for injustice: ""I never thought of dragging the contract"" Yesterday, an article on the Internet infuriated Wang Min, the general manager of Nansteel Club, who said that the general manager of the club was in a victorious posture, ""We will try to sign a contract with them in the next two or three days, and I think there will be a good result."" The article also said that the club's repeated talks with the players were just a ruse, and the club's statement was that it didn't matter whether the players signed or not, and in the end, everyone could still be friends. It is actually to give the players a sense of ""aloofness from the high place"". Wang Min strongly condemned such irresponsible statements: ""First of all, I would like to clarify that the club's attitude towards contract negotiations with players and coaches is sincere. The contract has not been resolved until now, and the club is very anxious. It is not as some media say that the club does not care, and that players will naturally sign contracts after the games start."" Second, I communicated with Yi Li and Hu Xuefeng yesterday afternoon, although there are still some differences on some details, the club's attitude is very positive. We understand the concerns of the players, and the club is negotiating internally to resolve the contract issues as soon as possible, after all, the league is about to start, and if it is delayed, it will inevitably affect Nansteel's performance in the new season. Finally, the club will certainly focus on the contract issue in the coming days and will not allow things to develop to the point of affecting the first match. Tomorrow, Nansteel Club will hold a press conference for the new season. Wang's expectation is: to solve the contract issue before the press conference, so that all players can devote themselves to the new season. Reporter Diao Yong of the local newspaper"

According to the report by Luo Yi, a reporter, and Liu Fei, a trainee, on a certain day, a college in Wuhan has a shameless girl! Living with her boyfriend in the dorm for nearly a year has already driven away two roommates! The post was crazily forwarded on major domestic websites and forums. It is mentioned in the post that a girl in a dormitory of a key university in Wuchang, Hubei, not only stayed for a year without permission, but even opened a ""couple online store"" in the boy's dormitory. Due to their ""close relationship"", the two ""forced"" two other male students who were supposed to live in the same dormitory to leave, causing a bad impact on campus. The post on Tianya.com, which was exposed, was clicked 580,000 times in four days. The post described how the woman and her boyfriend ""stayed up late and got up late, hugging each other to sleep,"" and their ""main business"" was to open a store on Taobao and run a private server for a certain online game. According to the content of the post, the boyfriend of the girl who stayed there basically did not go to class, did not go out to activities, cheated in exams, and the girl who stayed there was listed with more than ten offenses by the poster, including ""using the toilet in the boys' dormitory directly"". In addition, the post also attached photos of the two people sleeping in the dormitory, but the photos were very blurry, and from the angle, they were all secretly taken from the door. The poster said that his counselor and secretary had talked to the person involved, but without effect. Posting online is because there is no other way, and the intention is to make it public to solve the problem. This post has been reposted on many domestic websites and forums, and the number of clicks on this post alone on Tianya Forum exceeded 580,000 in just four days. In the replies of netizens, the reporter saw that most netizens expressed contempt for the girl and her boyfriend's behavior, even demanding that the girl be ""human flesh searched"". Nearly one-third of the netizens questioned the school's dormitory management level. Some netizens also think that people should be rational, and should not blame the school, or even insult the students involved, and give them a chance to repent. The self-styled party member posted on the school BBS to clarify yesterday afternoon. After the journalist browsed the school BBS, he found that a netizen named ""xiangjuzi"" posted at 18 o'clock in the early morning, ""As one of the parties involved, I must clarify a few issues."" The post confirmed the identity of the student couple, and from the perspective of the parties involved, it said, ""A girl with a thick face has appeared at a university in Wuhan!"" Living with her boyfriend in the dorm for nearly a year has already driven away two roommates! After refuting some views that were inconsistent with the post, it was stated that the rest was consistent with the facts. The male lead of the incident has promised to apologize to us, and may go out to rent a house in the near future. The female has returned to her hometown in Shandong recently. “xiangjuzi” said that the three of us failed to express our stance in time, which led to the deterioration of the incident, and we are also responsible for this. He hopes that this will not affect the reputation of the school and emphasizes, ""After all, it feels a bit like crossing the moral bottom line, but there is absolutely no such behavior as some netizens speculated, please be careful."" “the girl moved out more than 20 days ago” The reporter learned from the administrator of the school’s male dormitory building No. 4 in the afternoon of yesterday that the dormitory mentioned in the post was not in building No. 4, but in room 306 of building No. 7.

By Sun Xiaowen, reporter. Text and photos. With the success of his TV series such as ""The Days of Youth"" and ""Struggle"", the writer, Feng Xiaowen, has become the spokesman for the ""80s generation"". Off the screen, he is a family man who worries about buying a house and supports his wife and children. Yesterday, the article appeared with the TV drama ""Home"" in Shanghai, and the cast of ""Home"" said seriously that many people in ""Home"" faced marriage problems, ""My marriage is not a problem."" He said this in public because there were rumors recently that his wife, Ma Yili, had a divorce. The article sniffed at it: ""I don't care about these groundless fake news."" The article says that his married life is very happy. At home, he is the breadwinner, while Ma Yili is both the breadwinner and the homemaker. For a while, he was so busy that his daughter did not want to see him. He reflected on himself and arranged more time to spend with his wife and children. When the reporter asked him if he thought he was a good father, he confidently replied, ""I hope that when you have the opportunity to ask my daughter this question, she will say that I am a good father."" The article says that his understanding of ""80s men"" is that they dare to challenge themselves and take on responsibilities. He admits that there is a shadow of himself in his roles, and his views on love. In ""Living in a Snail's Shell,"" his girlfriend, who loved him to death, ultimately left him for the sake of material interests in reality. The article shows understanding for ""her"": not everyone can get married and have children after experiencing one love, and live to old age. As long as you stick to your own beliefs, you will meet a more suitable person after experiencing such setbacks.

It was the first film of Li Lianjie's ""abandoning martial arts for literature"", directed by Doo Won, with articles, Gu Long-mei and others starring in it.

The number of test sites for this year's college entrance examination in Beijing has been allocated, with 123 test sites, 15 fewer than last year due to a significant decrease in the number of candidates. Currently, each district and county has started to test the video surveillance equipment of the examination sites. During the college entrance examination, the ""electronic eyes"" will patrol all the examination rooms. This year's college entrance examination is the one with the fewest candidates in the city in six years, with only 80,241 candidates, a decrease of more than 20,000 candidates compared to last year, with a decline of 20%. The reduction in candidates has led some districts to adjust the settings of examination sites. It was revealed that there are 10 examination centers in Dongcheng District this year, one less than last year, and there are 14 examination centers in Xicheng District, which have also been adjusted. The decrease in candidates in Haidian District this year is lower than the average decrease in the city, and nearly one-fifth of the candidates in the city come from Haidian. There are three less and one more examination sites in this district this year, according to the distribution of candidates. The three examination sites that were responsible for the examination last year will no longer be responsible for the examination, and a new examination site will be added in the area where the candidates are relatively concentrated. This week, each district will inspect and adjust the video surveillance equipment, air conditioners, and loudspeakers of the examination schools. Before the college entrance examination, the city will conduct two rounds of joint adjustments for all the ""electronic eyes"" of the examination sites to ensure that the equipment is operating normally. During the college entrance examination, the remote electronic patrol system of the education examination will cover all the examination rooms. With the implementation of online marking for college entrance examination mathematics, the city will achieve online marking for all subjects for the first time this year. When the examinees answer the questions, they need to write the answers on the designated answer sheet. Online marking will take place with back-to-back, two teachers per question, and if the score difference between the two teachers exceeds the limit, a third teacher will be involved in the marking. Online marking will minimize human factors, reduce the error rate of score verification, improve efficiency, and ensure the fairness and justice of the examination. Since this year is the first college entrance examination for the new senior high school curriculum, the structure of the test paper, the distribution of scores, the design of question types, the method of marking, and the admission form have all been adjusted. In order to better formulate college entrance examination questions, ensure the smooth conduct of the college entrance examination, and also to test the adaptability of candidates to the new college entrance examination, the city has now completed a ""simulation test"" for more than 5,000 candidates in some districts and counties on the trial examination and online marking. The test data will provide a reference for ensuring the smooth conduct of the examination. Before the college entrance examination, each high school will also remind candidates of the precautions to take, so that they can take the exam calmly. (Reporter: Liu Hao)"
骗子花700元办假证骗走朋友80万现金骗人者已被警方刑拘本报吉林讯（记者姜彦艳通讯员高明众刘义平）用700元办的假证，从朋友手里骗来80万现金。磐石市公安局日前破获了一起特大合同诈骗案。受骗人老张是磐石市一家餐饮服务公司的法人代表。2008年12月，老张的好友找到老张，并介绍给他一位自己的朋友。好友说，这个开公司的朋友叫王显奎，是经营农用物资的，公司名叫吉林省磐石市伯洋农业科技有限公司，因资金周转问题想向老张借点钱，并提出支付利息。老张碍于情面应了下来，并提出用对方位于磐石市富太镇的房产做抵押。王显奎开始表示为难，后来也应允了下来。老张拿到王显奎公司的房屋产权证和土地使用证后，分别于2008年12月和2009年1月两次共借给了王显奎现金80万元。今年8月中旬，还款日期到了，老张准备向王显奎要钱。可他不但没要到钱，反而得到了伯洋农业科技有限公司的房产已被王显奎卖掉的消息。老张纳闷，“房产证、土地证都在我手里，房子怎么被卖掉？”再打电话联系王显奎，却发现对方已经关机了。老张这才觉得，自己受骗了。他先拿出王显奎抵押给自己的房产证、土地证来到了磐石市房产交易中心，经核实自己手里的房产证编号都对，可证件是假的，而此房产也真的被转让给沈阳市一家公司的磐石分公司了。证实受骗后，老张向磐石市公安局报了警。磐石警方在接到老张的报警后，迅速组织警力展开侦破工作，当天便将犯罪嫌疑人王显奎抓捕。经讯问，王显奎交代，近年来由于经营不善欠下大量外债，基本靠着拆东墙补西墙维持脆弱的资金链，在通过朋友向老张借钱时得知老张需要自己公司的房产作为抵押后，便到长春市通过做假证件的以350元一个的价格花了700元分别制作了假的房屋产权证和土地使用证，以此假证在老张处骗来80万现金。目前，王显奎已被磐石警方刑事拘留，案件在进一步审理当中。	姜彦艳,高明众,刘义平,老张,王显奎	负向	"The fraudster spent 700 yuan to get a fake ID and defrauded his friend of 800,000 yuan in cash. The fraudster has been criminally detained by the police. Jilin News (Reporter Jiang Yanyan, Correspondent Gao Mingzhong, Liu Yiping) A fake ID costing 700 yuan was used to defraud 800,000 yuan in cash from a friend. The Panshi Public Security Bureau cracked a major case of contract fraud recently. Zhang Laozhao, the victim, is the legal representative of a catering service company in Panshi City. In December 2008, Lao Zhang's good friend introduced him to one of his friends. My friend said that this friend who started a business is Wang Xiankui, who operates agricultural supplies. The company is called Jilin Province Pan Shi City Boyang Agricultural Science and Technology Co., Ltd. Due to the problem of capital turnover, he wants to borrow some money from Old Zhang and proposes to pay interest. Old Zhang reluctantly agreed out of politeness and proposed to use the property in Futa Town, Panshi City as collateral. Wang Xiankui initially found it difficult, but eventually agreed. After Old Zhang received the property rights certificate and the land use certificate of Wang Xiankui's company, he lent 800,000 yuan in cash to Wang Xiankui twice in December 2008 and January 2009. In mid-August this year, the due date for repayment arrived, and Old Zhang was preparing to ask Wang Xiankui for money. But instead of getting the money, he learned that Wang Xiankui had sold the property of Boyang Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. Old Zhang was puzzled, ""The property certificate and the land certificate are in my hands, how can the house be sold?"" Call Wang Xiankui again, but find that the other party has already turned off the phone. Old Zhang only then realized that he had been cheated. He first took Wang Xiankui's mortgage property certificate and land certificate to the Panshi City Real Estate Trading Center. After verification, the property certificate numbers in his hand were all correct, but the certificates were fake, and the property had really been transferred to the Panshi branch of a company in Shenyang. After being defrauded, Old Zhang reported the case to the Panshi Public Security Bureau. After receiving Zhang Lao's report to the police, the police in Panshi quickly organized a force to investigate and solve the case, and apprehended the suspect Wang Xiankui on the same day. After interrogation, Wang Xiankui admitted that in recent years, due to poor management, he had accumulated a large amount of external debt, and basically relied on borrowing from others to maintain a fragile capital chain. When he learned from his friend that Old Zhang needed his company's property as collateral, he went to Changchun City to make fake documents and spent 700 yuan to make a fake house ownership certificate and a fake land use certificate at a price of 350 yuan each. He used these fake certificates to defraud 800,000 yuan in cash from Old Zhang. Currently, Wang Xiankui has been criminally detained by the Panshi police, and the case is under further investigation."
北京晚报：网瘾者免责是天大误解11月8日，我国首部《网络成瘾诊断标准》通过专家论证，将由解放军总后勤部卫生部报批国家卫生部后，在全国各大医院，特别是三甲级医院的精神科推广使用。该标准将网络成瘾分为网络游戏成瘾、网络色情成瘾、网络关系成瘾、网络信息成瘾、网络交易成瘾五类，网络成瘾被纳入精神疾病范畴。根据《诊断标准》的描述，网瘾最直观的一项量化标准是平均每日连续使用网络时间达到或超过6个小时，且符合症状标准已达到或超过3个月。其他标准还有对网络有强烈渴求或冲动；减少或停止上网时会出现周身不适、烦躁、易激怒、注意力不集中、睡眠障碍等戒断反应；因使用网络而减少或放弃了其他的兴趣、娱乐或社交活动等。负责该课题的北京军区总医院医学成瘾科主任陶然表示，这个标准是他们4年来对3000多人进行研究之后得出的结论。如果该标准获得最终确认，我国就将是全世界第一个将网瘾列为精神疾病的国家。“中国戒除网瘾第一人”陶宏开教授公开反对《诊断标准》。根据自己对5000多个案例的研究，陶宏开表示：“网瘾不是病，更不是犯罪。我坚决反对把网瘾青少年当做精神病人治疗，给患网瘾的孩子扣上‘精神病’的帽子。”在网友中，支持者认为：“网瘾被定性为一种疾病，只代表我们以后会更专业更正式更全面地去考虑上网所引起的行为障碍，对于网络所带来的消极后果有更科学的方法去预防以及控制。”而反对者认为，“精神病的帽子能随便这么乱扣吗？那网吧岂不成了疯人院？”有网友自嘲地说：“我现在才知道，原来我是精神病啊。”“网瘾是精神病的话，那他们抢劫杀人不是都没有罪了？”网友“无知”的留言代表了不少人的观点。这个医学上的争论突然和司法问题联系在一起。在人们的印象中，精神病人犯罪可以不负法律责任，那么网络成瘾被纳入了精神病范畴，是不是意味着网络成瘾患者也不用对自己的行为承担法律责任呢？社会的质疑在现实中马上得到印证。11月10日下午，一份精神鉴定申请寄往四川省高级法院，《网络成瘾诊断标准》的第一次适用居然是以司法审判的方式出现的。21岁的四川射洪县青年胡安戈沉迷网络游戏。去年3月，他自称要做水产生意，让父母出资赞助。父亲给了他5万元钱，可胡安戈却将这些钱全用来买游戏装备。无颜面对父母的胡安戈突然有了一个荒唐的想法：“我辜负了父母的期望，不如结束他们的生命，让他们彻底解脱。”去年7月14日，他买了20包毒鼠强，放在家中的剩菜里。为了制造不在场的证据，他开车离开了家。父亲吃了掺有毒药的饭菜后中毒，所幸抢救及时，脱离了危险。	陶然,陶宏开,无知,胡安戈	正向	"Beijing Evening News: Internet addiction exemption is a huge misunderstanding. On November 8, the first ""Diagnosis Standard of Internet Addiction"" in China passed the expert argument, and will be promoted and used in the national major hospitals, especially the psychiatry departments of the tertiary hospitals, after being reported to the Ministry of Health by the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army. This standard divides internet addiction into five categories: internet gaming addiction, internet pornography addiction, internet relationship addiction, internet information addiction, and internet transaction addiction. Internet addiction has been included in the scope of mental illness. According to the description of the diagnostic criteria, the most intuitive quantitative standard of internet addiction is that the average daily continuous online time reaches or exceeds 6 hours, and the symptoms have met the criteria for more than 3 months. Other criteria include a strong craving or impulse to use the Internet; withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anger, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances when reducing or stopping Internet use; and a reduction or abandonment of other interests, leisure, or social activities due to Internet use. Dr. Tao Ran, the head of the Department of Medical Addiction of the Beijing Military Area General Hospital, who is in charge of the topic, said that this standard is the conclusion they have drawn from the research of more than 3000 people over the past four years. If the standard is finally confirmed, our country will be the first in the world to list internet addiction as a mental disorder. Professor Tao Hongkai, the first person in China to quit internet addiction, openly opposes the diagnostic criteria. Based on his research of more than 5,000 cases, Tao Hongkai said, ""Internet addiction is not a disease, and it is not a crime either."" I firmly oppose treating internet-addicted teenagers as mental patients and putting the label of ""mental patient"" on children who are addicted to the internet. Among netizens, supporters believe that categorizing internet addiction as a disease only means that we will be more professional, formal, and comprehensive in considering the behavioral disorders caused by internet use in the future, and have more scientific methods to prevent and control the negative consequences brought by the internet. And the opponents argue that mental illness cannot be so casually labeled. Then the internet cafe would become a madhouse? Some netizens said self-mockingly, ""I only know now that I am a mental patient."" If internet addiction is a mental illness, then do those who rob and kill not have any crimes? The comment by ""Ignorant"" on the Internet represents the views of many people. The medical debate suddenly became entangled with legal issues. In people's minds, mental patients can be exempt from legal responsibility for criminal acts. Does the inclusion of internet addiction in the category of mental illness mean that internet addicts do not have to bear legal responsibility for their behavior? Social doubts were quickly confirmed in reality. On the afternoon of November 10, an application for mental health evaluation was sent to the Higher People's Court of Sichuan Province. The first application of the ""Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction"" was actually presented in a judicial trial. Huanganguo, a young man from Sheshan County, Sichuan Province, was addicted to online games at the age of 21. Last March, he claimed that he wanted to do a business in seawater and asked his parents to sponsor him. His father gave him 50,000 yuan, but Juancho spent all of it on gaming equipment. Juanego, who suddenly had an absurd idea, could not face his parents: ""I have disappointed my parents' expectations, why not end their lives and let them be completely relieved."" On July 14 last year, he bought 20 packages of rat poison and put them in the leftover food at home. To create an alibi, he drove away from home. The father was poisoned after eating food laced with poison, but fortunately, he was rescued in time and escaped danger."

梁文博成丁俊晖后中国男二号他好比未经雕琢的钻石新浪体育讯　2009年威尔士公开赛资格赛最后一轮，梁文博将与本土选手戴尔争夺一个正赛席位。在开赛之前，我们对梁文博进行一番全方面的实力评估。中国选手梁文博出生于1987年，年仅21岁的他去年年终世界排名第40位，临时排名第21位。他大胆进攻的打球风格使他赢得了勇敢无畏的这样的评价，而在世锦赛中因为搞错主持人意思提前出场的他也被媒体冠了一个外号“是去是留”。梁文博在职业赛最好的成绩是08年世锦赛的八强，这也是中国内地选手在世锦赛的最好成绩。2006年多哈亚运会，代表中国参赛的他获得了个人项目的亚军以及团体冠军，同时他也是2005年IBSF21岁锦标赛的冠军。总体评价：梁文博确立中国男二号地位默默无闻的梁文博在08年世锦赛一路过关斩将闯入八强令世人惊叹，而他强势的进攻风格也赢得谢菲尔德球迷的青睐。他首轮击败了前世界冠军达赫迪，随后决胜局险胜经验丰富的老将斯威尔，在与最终的冠军奥沙利文的对决中，梁文博也给对手造成了不小的麻烦。在赛季首个排名赛北爱尔兰的比赛中，梁文博5-0横扫前世界冠军艾伯顿闯入16强。在本赛季巴林锦标赛资格赛5-1战胜古尔德的比赛中，梁文博轰出了职业生涯的第一个147分，并且打出139分以及115分两个高分杆将对手淘汰出局。如今，梁文博已经成为中国军团排在丁俊晖之后的第二号人物。实力分析：有能力闯入前16成为明星级球员梁文博有着令人惊叹的远台进攻能力，他击球的速度以及毁灭性也令人称道。他在比赛中所表现出来淡定的态度也证明他可以处理好自己身上的压力，而他的幽默感也使得观众对这个来自东方的少年颇为喜爱。用英国媒体的话来说，如果梁文博能够闯入前16名，他完全可以成为一个明星级的球员。弱点分析：打法激进恐成其软肋在某种程度上，他激进的打法同样是他的软肋所在。梁文博无畏的进攻打法很有可能给他带来难以收拾的局面，希金斯就曾经指出，如果梁文博的球风总是这么开放，那么他在面对顶尖球手的时候是很难获得胜利的。因此，在进攻时机的选择上多加斟酌对梁文博有益无害，其次，安全球质量的提高对于他来讲也是当务之急。前景分析：天赋毋庸置疑仍需脚踏实地梁文博好比一颗未曾雕琢的钻石，毫无疑问他是一名很有天赋的选手，但是他一定要踏踏实实的做一名比赛型的选手而不是昙花一现的球员。巴林锦标赛就是一个很好的例子，在打出满分杆横扫古尔德之后，梁文博随后2-5输给了乔治。老一辈球员总告诫年轻球员要戒骄戒躁，对于梁文博来讲也是一样。经过大赛的磨炼以及自身的努力，梁文博今后会有闪光的一天。作为一名刚刚跨入职业赛的年轻选手来说，梁文博的前途一片大好，但是如何在群雄并起的年代闯出属于自己的一片天地，梁文博要学习的还有很多。临近赛季末，威尔士公开赛对于他来讲是个抢分绝佳的时机。(Matt)	梁文博,丁俊晖,威尔士,戴尔,达赫迪,斯威尔,奥沙利文,艾伯顿,古尔德,希金斯,乔治,Matt	正向	"Lang Wenbo became the second man in China after Ding Junhui. He is like an uncut diamond. Lang Wenbo will compete with local player Dale for a place in the main event of the 2009 Welsh Open qualification round. Before the match, we made a comprehensive assessment of Liang Wenbo's strength. Chinese player Liang Wenbo was born in 1987. At the age of 21 last year, his world ranking was 40th and his temporary ranking was 21st. His bold playing style earned him the reputation of being fearless, and he was also given the nickname ""To or Not to Go"" by the media for his premature appearance at the World Championship due to misunderstanding the host's meaning. Liang Wenbo's best performance in a professional tournament was the quarterfinals of the World Championship in 2008, which was also the best performance of Chinese mainland players in the World Championship. In the 2006 Doha Asian Games, he won the silver medal in the individual event and the team championship, representing China, and he was also the champion of the IBSF 21-year-old championship in 2005. Overall evaluation: Liang Wenbo established his status as the second man in China Liang Wenbo, who was once unknown, made a stunning run to the quarter-finals in the 2008 World Championship, and his strong offensive style also won the favor of the Sheffield fans. He defeated the former world champion Doherty in the first round, and then narrowly won the deciding frame against the experienced veteran Swail. In his match against the eventual champion O'Sullivan, Li Wenbo also caused considerable trouble for his opponent. In the first ranking event of the season, Liang Wenbo swept former world champion Abbot 5-0 in Northern Ireland and advanced to the 16强. In the qualifying match of the Bahrain Championship in this season, Liang Wenbo scored his first 147 in his career and knocked out his opponent with two high breaks of 139 and 115, winning 5-1. Now, Liang Wenbo has become the second man in China’s army after Ding Junhui. Strength analysis: With the ability to enter the top 16 and become a star player, Liang Wenbo has amazing long-range offensive skills, and his striking speed and destructiveness are also praiseworthy. The calm attitude he showed in the competition also proved that he could handle the pressure on himself, and his sense of humor also made the audience like this young boy from the East. According to the British media, if Liang Wenbo could enter the top 16, he could become a star player. Weakness analysis: Aggressive play may become his Achilles' heel To some extent, his aggressive play is also his Achilles' heel. Li Wenbo's fearless offensive style may bring him a mess that is hard to clean up, and Higgins once pointed out that if Li Wenbo's style is always so open, it will be difficult for him to win against top players. Therefore, careful consideration of the timing of the attack would be beneficial to Liang Wenbo, and secondly, improving the quality of the safety ball is also an urgent matter for him. Prospect analysis:天赋毋庸置疑仍需脚踏实地Liang Wenbo is like an unpolished diamond. There is no doubt that he is a talented player, but he must be a player who is down-to-earth and a match player rather than a player who is a flash in the pan. The Bahrain Championship is a good example, where Liang Wenbo, after sweeping Gould with a maximum break, lost 2-5 to George subsequently. The older generation of players always warn the younger players to be modest and not arrogant, and the same applies to Liang Wenbo. After the competition and his own efforts, Liang Wenbo will have a brilliant day in the future. As a young player just entering the professional circuit, Li Wenbo's future is bright, but how to carve out his own territory in an era of rising stars, Li Wenbo still has a lot to learn. As the season draws to a close, the Welsh Open is a great opportunity for him to earn points. (Matt)"

瑞银大幅调降金银现货31个月目标价瑞银宣布，将黄金现货3个月平均目标价下调7.1%，至1950美元/盎司，将1个月平均目标价下调9%，至1775美元。与此同时，将白银现货3个月平均目标价下调30%，至35美元/盎司，将1个月平均目标价下调30.4%，至32美元。瑞银在研究报告中指出：“我们看好黄金的基本立场没有改变，投机仓位较轻对金价是一个重大有利因素。但是，鉴于近来贵金属市场动势萎缩，我们早先设定的未来1个月和3个月目标价显得过于激进。”瑞银还称，未来几个月中，鉴于自己预计黄金的表现将更好，金/银价比率将进一步走升。(严郑/编译)本文系译者授权新浪财经独家使用，任何媒体未经授权均不得转载。若需授权必须经新浪财经与译者本人取得联系并获得书面认可。如果私自转载本文，译者保留一切追诉的权力，直至追究私自转载者的法律责任。	严郑	正向	"UBS significantly reduced the 31-month target price for gold and silver spot.

河南女工被冒名顶替上班10年行政机关帮助造假本报通讯员曾庆朝梅安生江维本报记者　邓红阳公民的姓名权是宪法和法律赋予每个公民的特定的人身权利，非依法定程序，任何人不得冒名顶替、篡改和使用。然而，在河南省南阳市，一名女工的姓名不仅被人冒名顶替，而且在此过程中，县教委有关人员帮助冒名顶替者伪造假档案、公安局户籍警帮助篡改姓名，使一个假身份女工，冒名顶替上班10年，变成了一名人民教师。由此，引发了一场全国罕见的侵害姓名权案。近日，此案在南阳市中级人民法院审结。冒名顶替者王爱珍、串通换档案的方城县教育体育局、篡改户籍的南阳市某区公安分局被判败诉，并向女青年尚玉冉赔礼道谦，赔偿精神抚慰金4万元。有法律专家告诉《法制日报》记者，此案中，赔偿是次要的，更重要的是相关造假者已构成徇私舞弊罪、伪造公文罪。身份信息被冒名顶替十年尚玉冉于1975年8月5日出生于南阳市方城县古庄店乡，1993年9月7日由古庄店乡迁到南阳市新华街。2007年12月17日申领居民身份证。女青年王爱珍，1971年2月30日出生于方城县杨楼乡房山村。1993年夏天，经史福长的介绍，王爱珍通过尚玉冉之父尚国富的身份关系，以尚玉冉之名报考南阳师专实用人才培训班，1995年毕业，毕业证及档案上的名字仍为“尚玉冉”，在曾用名一栏中注明为王爱珍。1997年方城县政府决定招1995年南阳师专实用人才毕业生进入教育系统工作，其中就有“尚玉冉”。1998年4月7日，方城县人劳局调“尚玉冉”等13人到教育系统上班。1998年9月4日，方城县教委分配“尚玉冉”等5人到小史店乡教办室工作，“尚玉冉”被分配到小史店第二初级中学任教，2007年9月“尚玉冉”调入小史店镇第一初级中学任教。而真正的尚玉冉则于1994年被南阳某印刷厂招为全民合同制工人，该厂自1997年开始，生产陷入停产状态，2008年6月27日申请破产，2009年8月10日被宣告破产。据法官介绍，在已称为“尚玉冉”的王爱珍被调入教育系统工作的过程中，王爱珍借用了尚玉冉的招工档案。1998年3月26日，方城县人劳局向方城县经贸委发出通知，调“尚玉冉”到教委工作。1998年3月28日，方城县印刷厂将“尚玉冉”的介绍信通知给县经贸委，1998年4月，方城县人劳局通知方城县教委为“尚玉然”办理劳动手续。2006年9月16日，王爱珍办理了姓名及身份证信息为“尚玉冉”，头像为王爱珍的二代身份证。2007年11月25日，王爱珍又办理了姓名为“尚玉然”，人口基本信息及头像为王爱珍的二代身份证。2007年11月份，真正的尚玉冉持户口本到辖区派出所办理二代身份证，但经户籍民警查证，尚玉冉身份证已办出。尚玉冉发现自己的身份证信息被王爱珍冒用后，即向有关部门举报。随后，方城县有关部门责令方城县人劳局、方城县印刷厂、方城县经贸委、方城县教体局及某公安分局对此事写出书面答复。2008年4月25日，方城县人劳局取消王爱珍的职工身份，尚玉冉仍属印刷厂。2008年8月26日，公安机关作出决定，撤销了“尚玉然”的户口。2008年9月5日，王爱珍取得临时身份证，姓名仍为王爱珍(同目前王爱珍的身份证号)。2008年10月9日，方城县教体局决定取消王爱珍顶替他人所取得的有关证书和证件。受害者起诉讨要姓名权2009年5月21日，尚玉冉以侵害姓名权为由将王爱珍诉至方城县人民法院，要求判令王爱珍、区公安分局、方城县教育体育局、方城县小史店镇第一初级中学立即停止侵权，向原告赔礼道歉，并连带赔偿原告工资损失79338元，交通费662元，精神损害7万元，共计15万元。据查，尚玉冉为高中毕业，未参加南阳师范专科学校的学习，无教师资格证；目前，尚玉冉名单在印刷厂破产后的工人名单中。2010年7月1日，方城县人民法院经审理后认为：王爱珍冒名尚玉冉的事实存在，其行为违反了法律的强行性规定，构成了对尚玉冉姓名权的侵权，在王爱珍招工录用的过程中，王爱珍使用尚玉冉的招工档案，亦构成了对尚玉冉的侵权。但因印刷厂自1997年起生产处于停滞状态，从事实上说，王爱珍的侵权并未对尚玉冉造成实质损害后果。王爱珍在办理二代证的过程中，有意涂改“然”为“冉”，主观上存在故意，也构成对尚玉冉姓名权的侵害，虽造成了尚玉冉2007年11月份不能办证的后果，但得到公安机关的及时纠正，并未给尚玉冉造成实质上的损害。因此，王爱珍侵害尚玉冉姓名权事实成立，但尚玉冉未参加教育系统工作，且自2005年起已以印刷厂下岗职工的身份享受了社会低保，因此，尚玉冉要求王爱珍赔偿其工资79338元的请求，法院不予支持，王爱珍侵犯尚玉冉的姓名权，对尚玉冉的精神造成了一定的伤害，酌定赔偿精神损害抚慰金10000元，并向尚玉冉赔礼道歉。方城县教体局在办理招生及招工的过程中审查不严，存在严重过错，在客观上同王爱珍共同实施了侵害尚玉冉姓名权的行为，依法应承担民事责任，酌定方城县教体局向尚玉冉赔偿精神损害抚慰金20000元，并赔礼道歉。南阳某公安分局在办证的过程中出现错误，但事后立即收缴并进行了更正，未造成事实上的损害，因此公安局不应承担责任。王爱珍分配到小史店二初中工作并非现在的一初中，因此小史店一初中不应承担责任。此外，尚玉冉要求王爱珍赔偿其信访路费662元，法院不予支持。尚玉冉诉求令王爱珍立即停止侵权，因公安分局已注销了“尚玉然”及头像为王爱珍、人口基本信息为尚玉冉的身份证，且方城县人劳局已注销了王爱珍冒名尚玉冉在方城县教体局的职工身份，方城县教体局也注销了王爱珍冒名尚玉冉的相关资格证书，且尚玉冉的工作关系也已被恢复到印刷厂，因此，其诉求已经得到了实际解决。二审获赔4万元精神损失费一审判决下发后，尚玉冉认为王爱珍不但侵犯了她的姓名权，也侵犯了劳动就业权，造成她十几年没有工作，无法获得报酬。在王爱珍侵权的过程中，某公安分局、教体局、一初中帮助出谋划策，共同完成侵权行为，构成共同侵权，公安分局、小史店镇一初中亦应承担民事连带赔偿其各项损失共计15万元。为此，尚玉冉提出上诉。“我使用尚玉冉姓名参加师专的实用人才培训班，是尚玉冉父亲默许并亲自操作的，没有盗用及恶意冒名的故意，不应承担赔偿精神抚慰金责任，尚玉冉在印刷厂工作在先，我进入教育系统工作在后，两人的劳动就业权利未受影响，而且由于尚玉冉起诉我，使我失去了工作，现无赔偿能力。”由此，王爱珍同时也提起上诉。方城县教体局则以“主观上没有过错，不应承担赔偿和连带责任”为由，也提起上诉。12月3日，南阳市中级人民法院二审公开审理后认为：王爱珍以尚玉冉之名报考南阳师专实用人才培训班，此后又利用尚玉冉的招工档案，获取了全民合同制教师资格，从事教育活动。王爱珍虽声称给尚玉冉之父尚国富说过并知晓，但不能认定尚玉冉本人同意使用尚玉冉姓名，侵犯了尚玉冉享有的姓名使用权，对此应承担主要过错责任；南阳某公安分局为王爱珍办理了“尚玉然”的身份证存在审查不严过错，客观上给王爱珍创造了条件，也构成了对尚玉冉的姓名侵权，应承担相应民事责任。方城县教委在招录人员时未严格按照条件审查相应的证件手续，导致王爱珍冒用尚玉冉姓名获取招生资格，日后又为其办理了调动手续，亦存在明显的过错行为，应对此承担相应责任。小史店一初中作为接收单位，主观上不存在过错，亦没有审查王爱珍冒用尚玉冉姓名的法定职责，没有侵犯尚玉冉姓名的故意和过失，对此不承担民事责任。基于以上责任认定，法院判决王爱珍向尚玉冉口头赔礼道歉并赔偿精神损害抚慰金20000元。南阳市某公安分局向尚玉冉口头赔礼道歉并赔偿精神损害抚慰金10000元。方城县教体局向尚玉冉口头赔礼道歉并赔偿精神损害抚慰金10000元。案外人语依法行政是我国依法治国战略对每个行政机关的根本要求。依照相关条例和2009年7月12日中央发布实施的《关于实行党政领导干部问责的暂行规定》的相关规定，当地纪检监察部门、组织部门，按照干部管理权限应对相关人作出免职、引咎辞职、责令辞职的行政问责，作出组织处理，以警示后人，杜绝类似事件发生。同时，单位承担民事责任外，案中相关人员已构成刑法中规定的徇私舞弊罪，也应依法追究刑事责任。	曾庆朝,梅安生,江维,邓红阳,王爱珍,方城县,区,尚玉冉,史福长,尚国富,小史店镇,尚玉然	正向	"A female worker in Henan Province was falsely employed for 10 years under a false name. The administrative organ helped forge the documents. This report was written by the reporter Zeng Qingchao, Mei Ansheng, and Jiang Wei. The reporter Deng Hongyang. The right to name is a specific personal right granted to every citizen by the constitution and law. No one shall forge, alter, or use it without legal procedures. However, in Nanyang, Henan Province, not only was a worker’s name usurped, but also, during the process, the relevant personnel of the county education committee helped the usurper forge false files, and the police station’s household registration police helped to alter the name, making a fake identity worker usurp the job for 10 years and become a people’s teacher. This triggered a rare case of infringement of the right to one’s name across the country. Recently, the case was concluded in the Intermediate People's Court of Nanyang City. The impostor Wang Aizhen, the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau that colluded to swap files, and the Nanyang City Public Security Bureau of a certain district that altered household registration were ruled to be liable for their actions and were ordered to apologize to the young woman Shang Yurán, and to compensate her with 40,000 yuan for mental distress. There are legal experts who told the reporters of the Legal Daily that compensation is secondary in this case, and what is more important is that the relevant fraudsters have committed the crime of embezzlement and the crime of forging public documents. Identity information was impersonated for ten years. Shang Yurran was born in August 5, 1975 in Fangcheng County, Guzhuangdi Township, Nanyang City. On September 7, 1993, he moved from Guzhuangdi Township to Nanyang City, Xinhua Street. Applied for resident identity card on December 17, 2007. Wang Aizhen, a young woman, was born on February 30, 1971 in Fancun County, Yangliu Township, Fancun Village. In the summer of 1993, Wang Aizhen, through the introduction of Shi Fuchang, took the practical talent training class of Nanyang Normal University under the name of Shang Yurong through the relationship of Shang Guofu, Shang Yurong's father. She graduated in 1995, and the names on the graduation certificate and file were still ""Shang Yurong"". Wang Aizhen was noted as an alias in the section of aliases. In 1997, Fangcheng County Government decided to recruit graduates of practical talents from Nanyang Normal University in 1995 to work in the education system, among whom was ""Shang Yurán"". On April 7, 1998, the Fangcheng County Personnel Bureau transferred ""Shang Yurán"" and 13 others to work in the education system. On September 4, 1998, the Fangcheng County Education Commission assigned ""Shang Yurán"" and 5 others to work at the Xiao Shidian Township Education Office, and ""Shang Yurán"" was assigned to teach at the Second Junior High School of Xiao Shidian Township. In September 2007, ""Shang Yurán"" was transferred to teach at the First Junior High School of Xiao Shidian Town. Then the real Shang Yurran was hired as a public contract worker by a printing factory in Nanyang in 1994. The factory began to enter a state of production shutdown since 1997, and applied for bankruptcy on June 27, 2008. It was declared bankrupt on August 10, 2009. According to the judge, Wang Aizhen borrowed Shang Yurran's recruitment file during the process of Wang Aizhen being transferred to work in the education system, and Shang Yurran has already become ""Shang Yurran"". On March 26, 1998, the Fangcheng County Personnel Bureau issued a notice to the Fangcheng County Economic and Trade Commission, transferring ""Shang Yurán"" to work at the Education Commission. On March 28, 1998, the Fangcheng County Printing Factory notified the County Economy and Trade Commission of the introduction letter of ""Shang Yurran"". In April 1998, the Fangcheng County Personnel Bureau notified the Fangcheng County Education Commission to handle the labor procedures for ""Shang Yuran"". On September 16, 2006, Wang Aizhen processed a second-generation ID card with the name and ID information as ""Shang Yurán"" and a photo of Wang Aizhen. On November 25, 2007, Wang Aizhen handled a second-generation ID card with the name ""Shang Yuran"" and the basic information and photo of Wang Aizhen. In November 2007, the real Shang Yuruan went to the local police station with a household registration book to handle the second-generation ID card, but after the household registration police officer checked, it was found that Shang Yuruan's ID card had already been issued. Shang Yurran reported to the relevant authorities after discovering that her ID information was being used by Wang Aizhen. Subsequently, the relevant departments of Fangcheng County ordered the Fangcheng County Personnel and Labor Bureau, Fangcheng County Printing Factory, Fangcheng County Economic and Trade Commission, Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau, and a Public Security Bureau to write a written reply to this matter. On April 25, 2008, the Fangcheng County Human Resources Bureau canceled Wang Aizhen's employee status, while Shang Yurán still belonged to the printing factory. On August 26, 2008, the public security authorities made a decision to revoke the household registration of ""Shang Yuran"". On September 5, 2008, Wang Aizhen obtained a temporary ID card, with the name still being Wang Aizhen (the same as the ID number of Wang Aizhen currently). On October 9, 2008, the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau decided to revoke Wang Aizhen's relevant certificates and documents obtained by replacing others. The victim sued for the right to name in 2009. On May 21, 2009, Shang Yurran sued Wang Aizhen to the Fangcheng County People's Court on the grounds of infringing on the right to name, requesting that the court order Wang Aizhen, District Public Security Bureau, Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau, and Fangcheng County Xiaoshi Town First Junior High School to immediately stop the infringement, apologize to the plaintiff, and jointly compensate the plaintiff for 79,338 yuan in salary losses, 662 yuan in transportation fees, and 70,000 yuan in mental damage, totaling 150,000 yuan. It was found that Shang Yurán had graduated from high school and did not attend the study at Nanyang Normal College, and had no teaching qualification certificate. At present, Shang Yurán is on the list of workers after the bankruptcy of the printing factory. On July 1, 2010, the Fangcheng County People's Court, after trial, held that Wang Aizhen's act of using a false name for Shang Yurang existed, which violated the mandatory provisions of the law and constituted an infringement of Shang Yurang's right to his name. In the process of Wang Aizhen's recruitment and employment, Wang Aizhen used Shang Yurang's recruitment file, which also constituted an infringement of Shang Yurang. But since the printing factory has been in a state of production stagnation since 1997, in fact, Wang Aizhen's infringement has not caused any actual damage to Shang Yurran. Wang Aizhen intentionally altered ""然"" to ""冉"" during the process of obtaining a second-generation ID card, and subjectively had the intention to do so, which also constituted an infringement of Shang Yuruan's right to his name. Although it caused Shang Yuruan to be unable to obtain an ID card in November 2007, it was promptly corrected by the public security organs and did not cause Shang Yuruan any actual harm. Therefore, Wang Aizhen's infringement of Shang Yurang's right to name is established, but Shang Yurang has not participated in the education system work, and has been enjoying the social minimum living security as a laid-off worker of the printing factory since 2005. Therefore, the court does not support Shang Yurang's request for compensation of 79,338 yuan for wages. Wang Aizhen's infringement of Shang Yurang's right to name has caused a certain mental injury to Shang Yurang, and the court awards 10,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress and apologizes to Shang Yurang. The Fancun County Education and Sports Bureau was negligent in the process of enrolling students and workers, and had serious misconduct. In an objective sense, it jointly committed the act of infringing on Shang Yurang's right to his name with Wang Aizhen. According to the law, it should bear civil liability. The Fancun County Education and Sports Bureau is ordered to compensate Shang Yurang 20,000 yuan for mental distress and apologize. An error occurred in the process of a public security bureau in Nanyang handling certificates, but it was immediately confiscated and corrected after the fact, and no actual damage was caused, so the public security bureau should not bear responsibility. Wang Aizhen was assigned to work at Xiaoshi Town No.2 Junior High School, not at the current No.1 Junior High School. Therefore, Xiaoshi Town No.1 Junior High School should not bear the responsibility. In addition, Shang Yurran asked Wang Aizhen to compensate for her petitioning travel expenses of 662 yuan, but the court did not support it. Shang Yurran asked Wang Aizhen to stop infringing immediately, as the police station had canceled the ID card of ""Shang Yuran"" and the ID card with Wang Aizhen's photo and Shang Yurran's basic information, and the Fangcheng County Human Resources Bureau had canceled Wang Aizhen's false identity as Shang Yurran in the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau, and the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau had canceled Wang Aizhen's false identity as Shang Yurran's relevant qualification certificates, and Shang Yurran's work relationship had also been restored to the printing factory, so her request had been actually resolved. After the second trial awarded 40,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress, Shang Yurang believed that Wang Aizhen not only infringed on her right to her name, but also on her right to employment, causing her to be unemployed for over a decade and unable to receive remuneration. During Wang Aizhen's infringement, a Public Security Bureau, an Education Bureau, and No. 1 Junior High School helped to plot and plan, jointly completed the infringement, and constituted joint infringement. The Public Security Bureau and No. 1 Junior High School of Xiaoshi Town should also bear civil joint and several liability for compensating all their losses totaling 150,000 yuan. In order to do so, Shang Yurang appealed. I participated in the practical talent training class of Normal College under the name of Shang Yurran with the consent and personal operation of Shang Yurran's father. There was no intention of stealing or maliciously impersonating, so I should not bear the responsibility of compensating for mental distress. Shang Yurran worked in the printing factory first, and I entered the education system later. The employment rights of the two people were not affected. Moreover, because Shang Yurran sued me, I lost my job, and now I have no ability to compensate. Thus, Wang Aizhen also appealed. The Education Bureau of Fangcheng County also appealed on the grounds that ""there was no fault subjectively, and it should not bear the liability for compensation and joint liability."" On December 3, the Intermediate People's Court of Nanyang City held a second public trial and found that Wang Aizhen, under the name of Shang Yurang, enrolled in the Practical Talent Training Class of Nanyang Normal University, and later obtained the qualification of a full-time contract teacher by using Shang Yurang's employment file to engage in educational activities. Although Wang Aizhen claimed that she had informed Shang Yurang's father, Shang Guofu, and that he was aware of it, it cannot be determined that Shang Yurang himself agreed to use his name. The use of Shang Yurang's name has infringed upon his right to use his name, and Wang Aizhen should bear the main liability for the fault. Nanyang Public Security Bureau committed a fault of strict review when it issued the ID card of ""Shang Yuran"" to Wang Aizhen, which objectively created conditions for Wang Aizhen and also constituted an infringement of Shang Yurang's name, and should bear corresponding civil liability. The Fangcheng County Education Commission did not strictly review the relevant documents and procedures according to the conditions when recruiting personnel, which led to Wang Aizhen using Shang Yurans name to obtain admission qualifications. Later, it also processed the transfer procedures for her, and there were obvious wrongful behaviors, and should bear corresponding responsibilities for this. As the receiving unit, Xiaoshi Store Junior High School did not have any subjective fault, nor did it have the statutory duty to review Wang Aizhen's use of Shang Yurang's name, and did not have the intention or negligence to infringe on Shang Yurang's name. Therefore, it does not bear civil liability for this. Based on the above determination of responsibility, the court ruled that Wang Aizhen should apologize to Shang Yuruan orally and compensate her for 20,000 yuan in mental distress. Nanyang Municipal Public Security Bureau apologized orally to Shang Yurán and compensated 10,000 yuan for mental distress. Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau orally apologized to Shang Yurran and compensated 10,000 yuan for mental distress. Third parties' statements are a fundamental requirement for law-based administration, which is the basic requirement of the strategy of governing the country according to law for each administrative organ. In accordance with relevant regulations and the Interim Provisions on the Accountability of Party and Government Leaders, which were issued and implemented by the central government on July 12, 2009, the local disciplinary inspection and supervision departments and the organization departments should, in accordance with the authority of cadre management, make administrative accountability decisions such as dismissal, resignation due to blame, and ordered resignation for relevant persons, and make organizational handling to warn the future and prevent similar incidents from happening. In addition, in addition to civil liability borne by the entity, the relevant persons involved in the case have also constituted the crime of embezzlement as stipulated in the Criminal Law, and criminal responsibility should also be pursued according to law."

渤海证券：政策刺激带来结构性机会证券通周边市场的大幅反弹为国内市场的继续上涨提供了良好的外部环境，截止上周五，上证综指收于2374.44点，上涨93.35点，涨幅达4.09%；而深证成指则收于8994.15点，上涨346.64点，涨幅达4.01%。指数上涨的同时两市成交量继续放大，全周共成交11106.4亿元，较前一周放大近三成。就本周市场走势来看，由于权重板块银行股的启动，确实为市场向上的突破增加了动力与信心，再加上目前市场热点轮动较为顺畅，预计本周股指突破前高2402点的可能性较大。但特别需要注意的是，此波股指的反弹虽然量能随着上涨出现放大，但创新高时量能也应创出新高，特别是在银行、地产等权重板块发力的情况下，量能更应明显放大，否则不排除为诱多行情的可能。市场热点方面，随着消息面的变化，银行、新上海、太阳能、钢铁等板块明显受到场外资金的关注，而有色金属板块上周更是放量大幅震荡。我们坚持对金融危机下世界需求严重萎缩与前期涨幅巨大的有色金属保持高度警惕的观点，而短线看好兼具世博会、国际金融中心、国际航运中心等多种利好预期的新上海板块。		正向	渤海证券: Policy stimulation brings structural opportunities. The large rebound of the surrounding market of the securities channel provides a good external environment for the continued rise of the domestic market. As of last Friday, the Shangzheng Composite Index closed at 2374.44 points, up 93.35 points, with a rise of 4.09%; while the Shenzhen Composite Index closed at 8994.15 points, up 346.64 points, with a rise of 4.01%. While the index continued to rise, the trading volume in both markets continued to increase, with a total trading volume of 11106.4 billion yuan for the whole week, an increase of nearly 30% compared to the previous week. Based on the market performance this week, the launch of the weighty sector of banking stocks has indeed added momentum and confidence to the upward breakthrough of the market. In addition, the current market hotspots are rotating smoothly, and it is likely that the index will break the previous high of 2402 points this week. But it is particularly important to note that the rebound of the stock index in this wave should see an increase in volume as it rises, and the volume should also reach a new high when it reaches a new high. In particular, if the major weight sectors such as banks and real estate are making a strong move, the volume should be significantly increased. Otherwise, it is not excluded that it may be a bullish trap. In terms of market hotspots, with the change of the news, the banking, new Shanghai, solar energy, steel and other sectors have been clearly paid attention to by the off-market funds, and the non-ferrous metal sector even saw a large fluctuation with increased trading volume last week. We stick to the view that we should remain highly vigilant about the serious shrinkage of demand in the world and the huge increase in non-ferrous metals in the early stage under the financial crisis, and we are optimistic about the new Shanghai block with multiple favorable expectations such as the World Expo, international financial center, and international shipping center in the short term.

乔治克鲁尼受够被逼婚扬言不再出席记者会新浪娱乐讯北京时间2010年1月1日消息，据台湾媒体报道，好莱坞男星乔治-克鲁尼受够了每次受访都得回答一些记者提出“何时要结婚？”之类的蠢问题，决定新年开始不再参加记者会，只接受少数经过滤后的访问。爱搞笑的乔治-克鲁尼虽然常以幽默耍宝的方式面对媒体提问，但经常被问些他不愿回答的无聊事，他受不了。日前他在接受权威的《娱乐周刊》访问时表示：当你在事业上已具有一席之地，别人也知道你是谁，这就够了，“我不想变得更有名。更何况电影卖座往往是靠影片本身，与我没什么关系。”他坚持不再出席电影记者会，就连最近推出的新片《直上云霄》都把宣传受访的工作交给其他演员。不过乔治-克鲁尼并未因此自绝于观众，他笑着说，“我还是会参加红地毯活动，但记者会就谢谢啦。我只把重点放在少数聪明的访问，让每个能够访问到我的人都觉得很难得。”或许因为推掉不少宣传记者会，乔治-克鲁尼在最近和女友伊莉莎贝塔-卡娜丽斯(ElisabettaCanalis)及朋友们在墨西哥度年假，享受轻松的热带假期。(俐俐/文)	乔治克鲁尼,乔治-克鲁尼,伊莉莎贝塔-卡娜丽斯,ElisabettaCanalis,俐俐	正向	"George Clooney is tired of being forced to get married and said that he will no longer attend the press conference.

Decide not to attend press conferences and only accept a few filtered interviews at the beginning of the new year, such as stupid questions. George Clooney, who likes to joke around, often faces media questions in a humorous and playful manner, but he can’t stand being asked boring questions that he doesn’t want to answer. Recently, when he was interviewed by the authoritative Entertainment Weekly, he said: when you have a place in your career and others know who you are, that's enough. ""I don't want to be more famous."" Moreover, the success of a film usually depends on the film itself, and has nothing to do with me. He insisted on not attending the film press conference, and even for his latest release, ""Straight Up to the Clouds,"" he handed over the promotional interview work to other actors. But George Clooney did not cut himself off from the audience, he smiled and said, ""I will still attend the red carpet event, but thank you for the press conference.""

At the birthday party, good brother Dada Dong called to congratulate, sang the birthday song with the fans on the scene, and sent a scarf as a gift, which moved Chen Yiru greatly! Chen Yiru held his first birthday party in Hong Kong on November 7. Although fans from all over the world wanted to celebrate their idol's birthday, venue problems ultimately meant that only 220 fans from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and other places could be invited. In addition to the birthday cake, the fan who had reserved a ticket also prepared a human-shaped cushion, a small teddy bear, a red egg, and flowers, and placed all the gifts on a long table to give to the idol, which made Chen Yiru pleasantly surprised! And Chen Yiru also prepared personalized signature towels, T-shirts, and thank-you cards to give back to the fans. Fans who were lucky enough to win the gifts could also take a photo with their idols as a memento. Fans all tried to hold on to Chen Yiru! In addition, Da Dong, a good brother, called to congratulate on his birthday, and then led the 220 fans on the scene to sing the birthday song through the phone. After that, the staff presented Da Dong with a Gucci scarf that he had brought from Hong Kong for Chen Yiru as a birthday gift, which moved him greatly! Chen Yiru, who was once secretly photographed while sleeping on a plane, smiled in satisfaction after receiving a scarf and said, ""I can use it to cover my head, and I can sleep on the plane openly in the future!"" ""30 and stand firm, I am actively seeking a girlfriend. Chen Yiru said about this year's birthday wish, ""This year's birthday is very touching, men should be 30 and stand firm!"" I used to want to get married and have a family at 30, but now I hope to do it before I turn 35! Was there any urging from family members? ) There was none when I just started out, but now that I've been in the industry for 5 years, my dad has some! Are you in a relationship? There is none! (Too high a requirement?) ) I just want to find a girl with the same life and value view, who can communicate, and the most important thing is filial piety. Appearance and nationality are not important! It seems that I once dated a Korean girlfriend, although we only communicated in English, we got along very well. Besides, Chen Yi-ru returned to Taiwan by air immediately after the birthday party, because he had to go back to attend a public welfare charity event, and he would have dinner with his family as usual on the 10th to celebrate. Since Wu Zun is still working in Shanghai, he will have dinner with the other three members of Fly Leaf later to make up for the celebration."

E-era, the rapidly developing Internet is gradually integrating into all aspects of traditional life, including the transformation of consumption methods. Online shopping has quickly become popular, and people are familiar with online stores and online banking, and many fashionable young consumers are extremely enthusiastic about this new consumption method. And now, group buying is becoming increasingly popular in online shopping, and more and more consumers hope to join in group buying to enjoy the benefits of wholesale prices. Although group buying has not yet become a mainstream consumption model, its explosive power has gradually become apparent. As a company that keeps up with the times, this information cannot be ignored. As the Internet becomes more widely used, group buying on the network will become more common, and the market will continue to expand, with an unlimited prospect. To expand market share, this channel of online group buying should not be underestimated! There are already many successful cases of online group buying, and it is still booming, which can be said to have a good development momentum. Carefully analyze group buying, the main online shopping model used by merchants nowadays is through the Internet platform, by professional group buying institutions to gather scattered consumers with the same purchasing intention to make bulk purchases from manufacturers. Its core advantage lies in the more favorable product prices. The prices are more affordable, and profits naturally decrease, which is also the biggest reason why many manufacturers and merchants are unwilling to participate in online group buying! For this question, a window and door company has given a very good answer! The success of group buying is closely related to whether the merchant has made adequate preparations beforehand, and the pricing strategy is an important part of it! Group buying prices must be discounted, but how to discount, how to attract consumers to buy while maintaining profits, is a problem that merchants should consider deeply. After all, in the face of price, merchants are the ones who have the initiative! Some agents also shared their successful group buying experiences, how to formulate clever and effective pricing strategies, and how to create a group buying atmosphere, etc. At the same time, agents believe that group buying is the trend, and as people become more dependent on the Internet, when they want to buy something, the first thing they think of is to go online!

美就业刺激计划推涨大宗商品煤飞色舞机会再现记者彭浩编者按：百转千回，被喻为变相的第三次量化宽松(QE3)——美国4470亿美元的就业刺激方案最终出台。回顾前两轮宽松的货币政策不难发现，全球流动性过剩和投资需求增强是大宗商品价格上涨的主力。而与大宗商品走势密切联动的煤炭和有色板块，在刺激政策的提振下，A股市场“煤”飞“色”舞则是老戏码。美国刺激计划被喻为变相QE3百转千回，被喻为变相的第三次量化宽松(QE3)——美国大规模的就业刺激方案最终出台。美国总统奥巴马在本周四(北京时间)迫不及待地向外界透露了即将推出的4470亿美元刺激计划，远超出市场预期的3000亿美元。本周五(北京时间)，奥巴马会公布刺激计划的详细内容。但对于资本市场而言，投资人关心的并不是详细内容，而是关心这笔钱究竟从哪里来？这是一个变相的QE3吗？在美国时间周四，即北京时间周五晚上，不仅仅奥巴马会详细阐述这个刺激计划，美联储主席伯南克也会在当天发表讲话。听听伯南克怎么说，就知道这4470亿究竟是不是变相的QE3了。早在8月10日，美联储便指出，美国经济的增长率明显低于预期，预计未来经济的复苏将更为缓慢，就业增长将颇为疲软，目前美联储正在讨论其他的政策工具。外加奥巴马连番“预告”的经济刺激计划，这使人不得不推测，变相的QE3已经开始启动。国务院发展研究中心企业研究所副所长张文魁最近表示，美国和欧洲是通过凯恩斯主义的方法来拉动经济，以前是靠金融体系、靠央行、靠美联储来刺激，这样会导致美国的QE3或者是变相的QE3一定会推出的。资金重返大宗商品市场对于奥巴马出炉的就业刺激计划，市场的反应比较乐观。投资者纷纷重返股市和大宗商品市场，其中一些投资者选择卖出黄金等避险资产、买入高风险资产。美国时间9月7日，美国三大股指上涨，交投最活跃的12月黄金期货结算价跌幅3%。纽约石油近来已经有一个反弹，也是对于量化宽松的憧憬。所谓量化宽松，是指央行通过购买国债等中长期债券，增加基础货币供给。例如前两次量化宽松，都是美联储自己印钞票，然后买美国政府发行的国债，美国政府拿到钱后去刺激经济。其关键点在于，这个世界平白无故地多了很多的美元，美元泛滥将导致通胀。回顾前两轮宽松的货币政策，投资者可以发现，全球流动性过剩和投资需求增强是大宗商品价格上涨的主导力量。美国于2010年11月宣布实行规模为6000亿美元的第二轮量化宽松货币政策(QE2)。美联储在执行QE2过程中投放的大量流动性并没有完全进入实体经济，而是有很大一部分进入了国际大宗商品市场，特别是涌入资源性产品市场和部分农产品市场，从而推动价格上涨。而与大宗商品走势密切相关的煤炭和有色板块，在刺激政策的提振下，A股市场“煤”飞“色”舞则是老戏码。旺季来临煤炭“起飞”煤炭股去年9至10月曾?升，当时受到季节性、通胀预期、QE2、节能减排年底结束等因素所刺激。此时，煤炭股再次受到同样的季节性及美国就业刺激计划等因素的提振。中金公司9月6日发布煤炭行业研究报告，表示煤炭股季节性行情有望逐步启动，期待显著的相对收益。动力煤价格有望企稳反弹，原因是下游行业补库存需求和9、10月份通常是电厂冬季备煤时段。焦煤价格则随钢铁业步入旺季而有望小幅反弹。“由于欧债危机恶化、国内经济放缓和紧缩政策持续等原因，短期煤炭板块仍面临一定压力，但良好的盈利确定性和即将到来的季节性行情将使煤炭板块有望跑赢大盘。”中金公司指出，如果欧债问题取得进展或美国推出经济刺激计划，煤炭板块有望出现可观行情。在具体投资标的方面，中金公司推荐中国神华(601088)、兖州煤业(600188)、中煤能源(601898)、潞安环能(601699)和兰花科创(600123)。其实，目前煤炭板块估值已处于较低水平。统计数据显示，截至目前，申万煤炭开采板块的平均市盈率为15.42倍，自2000年以来的平均值为28.92倍；市净率为3.43倍，自2000年以来的平均值为4.78倍；预测市盈率方面，煤炭板块2011年、2012预测市盈率分别为13.87倍、11.72倍。有色随大宗商品“舞动”回顾去年，在美联储推出第二轮数量宽松政策后，资本市场更是开始了新一轮的大涨，尤其是大宗商品市场。放眼当下，投行摩根士丹利称，在周五和周六的G7财长和央行行长会议上，主要经济体可能联手采取一系列的救市行动。大摩预计，美、欧、日和英国央行可能在周末的会议上宣布联手放松货币政策，比如降息或是加大量化宽松。大摩的分析师表示，当前经济增长疲软以及资产价格持续大跌间形成的恶性循环，使得各国更有可能采取联合的货币政策干预行动。此前，有外媒引述知情人士的话报道称，各国可能在这次G7会议上维持刺激性的货币政策，并在允许的情况下，放慢一些国家的财政收紧步伐。对于股市而言，预期先行，也就是流动性可能在达到极致后迎来的放松边际，对持续受压制的有色板块当然是大利好。另外，美国即将推出的4470亿美元刺激计划为大宗商品市场走强注入强心针。此前，受累于美国评级下调，欧债危机爆发，有色商品价格下跌，导致国内的有色板块出现连续暴跌，不少品种短期跌幅超20%，在相关利好预期刺激下，从历史经验来看，跌幅较大的板块短期面临较大的反弹空间。近期磷矿资源类个股表现出色，有望重新激发市场对同属稀缺资源的有色板块的热情。重点公司云海金属(002182)云海金属董事长梅小明在9月7日的网上说明会上表示，公司年初至今接订单较去年同期有增长，明年公司计划铝镁合金销售规模进一步提高，并以效益为中心，通过多种方式量化成本控制。同时，云海金属董秘吴剑飞表示，目前公司暂无股权激励计划。公司将集中精力做好现有业务，暂无战略性并购重组的想法。对于未来经营情况，公司预计，2011年1-9月归属于上市公司股东的净利润比上年同期下降幅度小于50%。对于业绩变动的原因，公司称铝合金销售量增长不如预期，以及财务费用比较高。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流入2724万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流入2920万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流入2551万元。株冶集团(600961)“企业用电受到限制，但总产量却不降反增，这是创新发展方式的结果。”株冶集团负责人近期谈到，仅电力成本一项，今年前7个月，株冶集团就增加成本5000万元。在铅锌主产品盈利空间低的情况下，我们利用现有的优势，从冶炼废弃物中提高金、银等有价金属的回收率。今年1-8月份，株冶完成销售收入80多亿元，比去年同期增长8.5%，铅锌总产量39.5万吨，预计全年产量60万吨，全年销售收入达110亿元。记者发现，株冶集团增产却不增收，今年上半年还处于亏损状态。尽管业绩不尽人意，但前期连续调整的株冶集团表现有所回暖，该股本周涨幅已经接近10%。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流出302万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流入1096万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流出1069万元。兰花科创(600123)对于兰花科创亚美大宁矿可能在9月份启动复产的传闻，兰花科创证券部工作人员回应称，现在还处于换证阶段，具体进度还不好说，但年内复产肯定是没问题的。兰花科创方面表示，目前双方正在积极办理亚美大宁公司采矿权许可证、安全生产许可证和其他证照的换发，延期、年检、更新等工作，推动亚美大宁公司尽快复产。根据多家机构的预测，以兰花科创原有36%的持股比例计算，若山西亚美大宁近期恢复产能至200万吨，可为兰花科创贡献每股收益近0.4元；该矿目前可具备500至600万吨产能；若2012年产量达到500万吨，则全年可为公司贡献每股收益近1元。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流入263万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流出1754万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流出4338万元。昊华能源(601101)根据公告，京东方计划投资220亿元到内蒙古鄂尔多斯投资5.5代AM-OLED有机发光显示器件生产线，当地政府将配置呼吉尔特矿区巴彦淖井田总量不低于10亿吨储量的煤矿，京东方将向昊华能源转让能源项目的控股股权，与昊华能源共同开发该煤炭资源。昊华能源目前拥有储量约25亿吨(其中位于鄂尔多斯的高家梁和红庆梁煤矿储量合计21.8亿吨)，权益储量19亿吨。长江证券分析，该项投资完成后公司的权益储量新增至少27%。预计该煤矿的设计储量达到800万吨左右，2015年有望建成投产。该机构预计，2011年、2012年和2013年昊华能源的每股收益将分别为1.449元、1.727元和1.807元。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流出175万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流出1929万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流出3496万元。《投资快报》发自广州	彭浩,奥巴马,伯南克,张文魁,梅小明,吴剑飞	正向	"The US employment stimulus plan, which is expected to be a de facto third round of quantitative easing (QE3), has finally been implemented, and the opportunity for a resurgence in the prices of commodities such as coal and copper has been created. Editor's note: After many twists and turns, the US employment stimulus plan worth $447 billion, which is expected to be a de facto third round of quantitative easing (QE3), has finally been implemented. It is not difficult to see from the first two rounds of loose monetary policy that global excess liquidity and increased investment demand are the main drivers of the rise in commodity prices. And the coal and non-ferrous metal sectors, which are closely linked to the performance of commodities, have been a familiar sight in the A-share market, with the ""coal flying and color dancing"" phenomenon boosted by stimulus policies. The US stimulus package was dubbed a de facto QE3, and the large-scale employment stimulus package eventually implemented in the US was dubbed a de facto third round of quantitative easing (QE3). US President Obama revealed the 447 billion US dollar stimulus plan that will be launched with great enthusiasm to the outside world on Thursday (Beijing time), far exceeding the market's expected 300 billion US dollars. On Friday (Beijing time), Obama will unveil the details of the stimulus package. But for the capital market, investors are not concerned with the details, but rather where the money comes from. Is this a disguised QE3? On Thursday, US time, which is Friday night, Beijing time, not only will Obama elaborate on this stimulus plan, but also Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will make a speech on the same day. Listen to Bernanke, and you will know whether these 4470 billion are a disguised QE3. As early as August 10, the Fed pointed out that the growth rate of the US economy was significantly lower than expected, and it expected that the future economic recovery would be much slower, and the employment growth would be quite weak. At present, the Fed is discussing other policy tools. In addition to Obama’s repeated “预告” of the economic stimulus plan, it is inevitable to speculate that the QE3 has already been launched in a disguised form. Zhang Wenge, deputy director of the Enterprise Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council, recently said that the US and Europe are using Keynesian methods to boost the economy, and that previously they relied on the financial system, the central bank, and the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy, which would inevitably lead to the launch of QE3 or a disguised QE3. The return of funds to the commodity market has been met with a positive response from the market, which is part of Obama's employment stimulus plan. Investors are returning to both the stock market and the commodity market, with some investors choosing to sell safe assets such as gold and buy high-risk assets. On September 7, according to the US time, the three major US stock indexes rose, and the settlement price of the most active December gold futures fell by 3%. New York oil has rebounded recently, also due to expectations of quantitative easing. Quantitative easing refers to the central bank increasing the supply of base money by purchasing government bonds and other long-term bonds. For example, in the two previous rounds of quantitative easing, the Fed printed money and bought US government-issued Treasury bonds, and the US government used the money to stimulate the economy. The key point is that there are now many more dollars in the world for no reason, and the oversupply of dollars will lead to inflation. Looking back at the two rounds of loose monetary policy in the past, investors can find that global excess liquidity and increased investment demand are the main forces driving up the prices of commodities. The US announced in November 2010 the implementation of the second round of quantitative easing monetary policy (QE2) with a scale of 600 billion US dollars. The large amount of liquidity injected by the Fed during the implementation of QE2 did not flow into the real economy, but a large part flowed into the international commodity market, especially into the resource products market and some agricultural products market, thus driving up prices. And the coal and non-ferrous metal sectors, which are closely related to the performance of commodities, have been a familiar sight in the A-share market, with the ""coal flying and color dancing"" phenomenon boosted by stimulus policies. With the peak season approaching, coal prices soared, and coal stocks rose in September and October last year, which was stimulated by seasonal factors, inflation expectations, QE2, and the end of energy conservation and emission reduction at the end of the year. At the moment, coal stocks have been boosted by the same seasonal and US employment stimulus factors. On September 6, CICC released a coal industry research report, indicating that the seasonal performance of coal stocks is expected to gradually start, and significant relative returns are expected. The price of thermal coal is expected to stabilize and rebound, as the downstream industries have a demand for replenishing their inventories, and September and October are usually the time for power plants to stock up for the winter. 焦煤价格 may rebound slightly as steelmaking industry enters the peak season. Due to the deterioration of the eurozone debt crisis, slowing domestic economy and the continued fiscal austerity, the coal sector will still face some pressure in the short term, but good profitability certainty and the approaching seasonal performance will make the coal sector likely to outperform the market. CICC noted that the coal sector is likely to see a good performance if progress is made on the Eurozone debt issue or if the US launches an economic stimulus package. In terms of specific investment targets, China International Capital Corporation recommended China Shenhua (601088), Yanzhou Coal Mining (600188), China Coal Energy (601898), Luanan Environmental Protection (601699), and Lan'an Science and Technology (600123). Actually, the valuation of the coal sector is currently at a low level. The statistical data shows that as of now, the average P/E ratio of the Shenwan coal mining sector is 15.42 times, with an average value of 28.92 times since 2000; the average P/B ratio is 3.43 times, with an average value of 4.78 times since 2000; in terms of forecast P/E ratio, the forecast P/E ratios for the coal sector in 2011 and 2012 were 13.87 times and 11.72 times, respectively. 有色 followed the ""dance"" of commodities. Looking back at last year, after the Fed launched the second round of quantitative easing, the capital market also began a new round of boom, especially the commodity market. Looking around the corner, investment bank Morgan Stanley said that major economies may take a series of market-saving actions at the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meetings on Friday and Saturday. Morgan Stanley expects that the central banks of the US, Europe, Japan and the UK may announce coordinated easing of monetary policy, such as cutting interest rates or increasing quantitative easing, at the meetings over the weekend. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say that the vicious cycle between weak economic growth and the continuous decline in asset prices makes it more likely that countries will take coordinated monetary policy intervention actions. Previously, foreign media quoted insiders as saying that countries may maintain stimulative monetary policy at this G7 meeting and slow down the fiscal tightening of some countries if possible. For the stock market, expectations come first, that is, the easing margin after liquidity reaches the extreme, which is of course a big benefit to the continuously suppressed non-ferrous metal sector. Moreover, the US$447 billion stimulus package that is about to be launched in the US will inject a strong heart stimulant into the commodity market. Previously, due to the downgrade of the US rating, the outbreak of the European debt crisis, and the decline in the prices of non-ferrous metals, the domestic non-ferrous metal sector experienced a continuous plunge. Many varieties experienced a short-term decline of more than 20%. Under the stimulation of relevant favorable expectations, based on historical experience, sectors with a larger decline in the short term face a larger rebound space. Recently, the shares of phosphate ore resources have performed well, which is expected to rekindle the market's enthusiasm for the non-ferrous metal sector, which is also a scarce resource. Chairman Me Xiaoming of Yunhai Metal (002182), a key company, said at an online press conference on September 7 that the company has received more orders this year than the same period last year. The company plans to further increase the scale of aluminum-magnesium alloy sales next year, and to focus on benefits, and to quantify cost control through various means. At the same time, Wu Jianfei, the secretary of the board of Cloud Sea Metal, said that the company currently has no equity incentive plan. The company will focus on doing a good job with its existing business and has no strategic M&A plans for the time being. For the operating conditions in the future, the company expects that the net profit attributable to the shareholders of the listed company in the first 9 months of 2011 will decrease by less than 50% compared to the same period last year. For the reasons for the change in performance, the company said that the sales volume of aluminum alloy was not as expected, and the financial expenses were relatively high. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds net inflow was 27.24 million yuan yesterday, and the net inflow of funds in the last 5 trading days was 29.2 million yuan, and the net inflow of funds in the last 10 trading days was 25.51 million yuan. Chuzhanye Group (600961): corporate electricity use is restricted, but total output is actually increasing. This is the result of innovative development methods. The head of Zhuyi Group recently said that in the first seven months of this year, the cost of Zhuyi Group increased by 50 million yuan due to power costs alone. When the profit margin of the main lead and zinc products is low, we take advantage of our existing strengths to increase the recovery rate of precious metals such as gold and silver from the smelting waste. In the first eight months of this year, Zhuyi has completed sales revenue of more than 8 billion yuan, which is 8.5% higher than the same period last year. The total output of lead and zinc is 395,000 tons, and the expected annual output is 600,000 tons. The annual sales revenue is expected to reach 11 billion yuan. Journalists found that Zhuyi Group increased production but not income, and was still in a loss state in the first half of this year. Despite poor performance, Zhuyi Group, which has been continuously adjusted in the early stage, has shown signs of recovery, and the stock has risen by nearly 10% this week. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds flowed out by 3.02 million yuan yesterday, while the net inflow of funds in the past 5 trading days was 10.96 million yuan, and the net outflow of funds in the past 10 trading days was 10.69 million yuan. For the rumor that Yamaoni Mine of Lanhua Innovation and Science (600123) may restart production in September, the staff of the securities department of Lanhua Innovation and Science said that it is still in the stage of obtaining a new license, and it is not easy to say about the progress, but restarting production within the year is definitely not a problem. LANECO stated that both parties are now actively handling the renewal, extension, annual inspection, and updating of the mining permit, safety production permit, and other certificates and licenses of Yama Dana, and are promoting the resumption of production of Yama Dana as soon as possible. Based on the forecast of multiple institutions, if Shanxi Asia-Mei Da Ning's production capacity is restored to 2 million tons in the near future, it can contribute nearly 0.4 yuan per share to Lan Kuaichuang's earnings with its original 36% shareholding ratio; the mine currently has a production capacity of 500 to 600 million tons; if the output in 2012 reaches 500 million tons, it can contribute nearly 1 yuan per share to the company's earnings for the whole year. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds net inflow was 2.63 million yuan yesterday, while the net outflow of funds in the past 5 trading days was 17.54 million yuan, and the net outflow of funds in the past 10 trading days was 43.38 million yuan. In the announcement, Huaxia Energy (601101) said that BOE planned to invest 22 billion yuan in Inner Mongolia Ordos to invest in a 5.5 generation AM-OLED organic light-emitting display device production line, and the local government will configure a coal mine with a total reserve of no less than 10 billion tons in the Huigeli矿区 Baoyan Nao well field. BOE will transfer the controlling equity of the energy project to Huaxia Energy, and jointly develop the coal resources with Huaxia Energy. Currently, Hua Hua Energy has reserves of about 2.5 billion tons (of which the reserves of Gaogiali and Hongqingli coal mines in Ordos are 218 million tons), and the rights reserves are 1.9 billion tons. Changjiang Securities analysis, after the completion of this investment, the company's equity reserves will increase by at least 27%. The design reserves of the coal mine are expected to reach about 8 million tons, and it is expected to be put into production in 2015. The institution expects that the EPS of Huaxia Energy in 2011, 2012 and 2013 will be 1.449 yuan, 1.727 yuan and 1.807 yuan respectively. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds flowed out by 1.75 million yuan yesterday, and the net outflow of funds in the past 5 trading days was 19.29 million yuan, and the net outflow of funds in the past 10 trading days was 34.96 million yuan.

iPhone收家中遭窃影像华裔工程师高科技擒贼据美国《星岛日报》报道，高科技工具的设计是帮助和方便使用者，圣荷西一名华裔居民就懂得利用手上的iPhone，在办公室遥控发现家中正被两名窃匪爆窃，报警将两窃匪拘捕。31岁圣荷西华裔居民PeterChen是一间高科公司的工程师，对高科技事物相当熟识，感恩节前在女朋友的汽车被人偷窃车内物品后，他以280元购买了一个Logitech700e监视摄影机，在自己圣荷西长青区的家中安装，以防家中亦被爆窃。他并将监视摄影机系统连接到他的iPhone中，而该系统正好在上周发挥作用。11月29日下午2时，当陈彼德在办公室工作时，他发现有电邮传到他的iPhone中，电邮是由他在家中安装的防盗监视摄影系统传来的，因为该系统开启后拍摄到家中有物体移动，即将拍摄到的照片电邮到他的iPhone,而发出警报。他在安装后亦曾收到该系统传来的照片，但发现移动的物体是家中的猫后，便将照片删除，但今次他发现照片是家中出现一名男子和一名青少年，他怀疑家中正被人爆窃，立即用iPhone打911报警。两名圣荷西交通警员SteevePayne警长和JeffreyFielder警员刚在陈家附近巡逻，接报后立即赶抵陈彼德的家，发现两名相信是窃匪的男子在屋内爆窃，将屋内的现金和电子游戏机放入袋中，即将两人拘捕。当陈彼德从办公室赶回家察看时，两警正将两窃匪送入警车。被捕两窃匪分别是26岁的GabrielHernandez和一名17岁的男孩，两人已被警方落案控以入屋爆窃罪名。圣荷西警方发言人RonnieLopez警长表示，该案正好显示警民合作的最好例子。事主利用高科技帮助警方拘捕爆窃匪徒。事主陈彼德则表示，“我当时亦十分紧张，因为过程有如电影情节，看见匪徒正在我的家中，但我又不能亲手拘捕他们，只有报警。”他说，“我花近3百元购买该防盗系统，现发现很值得。今后我会更小心查核iPhone收到该系统传来的照片，但考虑在家中安装更多的监视摄影机。”(张耀鋈)	PeterChen,陈彼德,SteevePayne,JeffreyFielder,陈家,GabrielHernandez,RonnieLopez,张耀鋈	正向	"The iPhone was used by a Chinese engineer to catch the thief at home. According to the United States ""Stardaily Daily"", the design of high-tech tools is to help and facilitate users. A Chinese resident in San Jose used his iPhone to remotely discover that two thieves were burglarizing his home in the office and reported the police to arrest the two thieves. Peter Chen, a 31-year-old Chinese American resident of San Jose, is an engineer at a high-tech company and is very familiar with high-tech things. After his girlfriend's car was stolen with its contents on the eve of Thanksgiving, he bought a Logitech 700e surveillance camera for $280 and installed it in his home in the Longgreen area of San Jose to prevent his home from being burglarized. He also connected the surveillance camera system to his iPhone, which just happened to work last week. At 2 p.m. on the afternoon of November 29, when Chen Bied worked in the office, he found an email sent to his iPhone. The email was from the anti-theft surveillance camera system he installed at home, because the system had taken a picture of the movement of an object at home after it was turned on, and sent the picture to his iPhone by email and issued an alarm. He had also received photos from the system after the installation, but he deleted them after finding that the moving objects were his cat at home. This time, he found that the photos showed a man and a teenager at home, and he suspected that his home was being burgled. He immediately called 911 on his iPhone to report the crime. Two San Jose police officers, Chief Steeve Payne and Officer Jeffrey Fielder, who had just patrolled near Chen's house, arrived at Peter Chen's house immediately after receiving the report. They found two men, who they believed to be burglars, stealing in the house, stuffing cash and video game machines into bags, and then arrested the two. When Chen Biede rushed home from the office to check, two policemen were putting two thieves into the police car. The two arrested burglars, 26-year-old Gabriel Hernandez and a 17-year-old boy, have been formally charged with housebreaking robbery by the police. Ronnie Lopez, a spokesman for the San Jose Police Department, said that the case was a good example of police-citizen cooperation. The victim used high-tech to help the police arrest the burglars. The victim, Chan Pui Tack, said, ""I was also very nervous at the time, because the process was like a movie plot, and I saw the robbers in my home, but I could not arrest them in person, I could only call the police."" He said, ""I spent nearly 300 yuan to buy the anti-theft system, and now I find it very worthwhile."" I will be more careful to check the photos sent by the system to my iPhone in the future, but I will consider installing more surveillance cameras at home. (Zhang Yaoyu)"

机构跑步出场午后延续调整姚茂敦昨夜，美股小幅收高。这让近期的死多头高兴不已，以为今天又是个大好日子。的确，A股早盘双双高开，但随后的几波跳水杀跌，表明忍耐多日的空方开始发威。其实，针对昨天的放量滞涨。笔者已经在收评《空方猛烈反击，强势调整将持续几日！》中有过分析，并认为：昨天的盘中调整其实并不充分，因此，这种调整可能还将持续几日。从早盘情况看，笔者的判断完全正确。从消息面看，今日好消息居多。其中，最重要的当然是：船舶工业振兴规划昨天如期出台，五大措施支持造船业；石化业规划昨天没上会，最快下周审议；证监会严把新股上市质量关，IPO近期难重启。但一条2月大小非日均减持4，33亿元，规模创一年来新高的利空消息，还是让市场感受了丝丝凉意。从机构资金流向看，本周连续3天跑步出场后，今日早盘机构继续出逃。根据统计，早盘沪市，机构资金净流出竟高达31亿左右。此举表明，经过一轮大幅反弹之后，机构对后市发展开始变得谨慎，并纷纷拉高出货，从而将风险留给拼命入场的中小投资者。从技术上看，目前，大盘多种技术指标已处于短期超买状态。特别是KDJ指标高位刚刚死叉向下，MACD红柱开始缩短，说明大盘的调整可能需要一定时间。不过，由于中短期均线勾头向上，底部不断抬高，已经对后市构成强大技术支撑。也就是说，经过必要的回调之后，大盘还有上攻动能。综上所述，尽管昨天沪指测试了2300点，并继续站在2245点之上，但从机构加速减仓来看，也表明大盘短期回调风险较大。再加上外围市场反复无常，也使得大盘必须要经过充分调整，消化掉部分获利盘和套牢盘之后，才有足够动能继续上攻。早盘，沪指跌破5日均线，量能萎缩，表明大盘将进入短期休整阶段。展望午后，继续震荡可能性比较大。	姚茂敦	负向	Institutions ran out for a run in the afternoon, and Yao Maodun continued to adjust last night. The US stock market rose slightly. This made the recent bearish head very happy, thinking that today was another great day. Indeed, the A-shares opened higher in the morning, but several subsequent plunges showed that the long-suffering bears had started to take the initiative. Actually, in response to yesterday's increased volume but stagnant price. The author has already written a review: The bears are making a fierce counterattack, and the strong adjustment will last for a few days! It has been analyzed in 》, and it is believed that the adjustment in the middle of yesterday's trading was not sufficient, so this adjustment may continue for a few more days. From the morning session, my judgment was completely correct. From the perspective of the news, there are more good news today. Most importantly, the shipbuilding industry revitalization plan was released on schedule yesterday, with five measures to support the shipbuilding industry; the petrochemical industry plan did not come to the meeting yesterday, and the earliest it will be reviewed next week; the CSRC is strictly controlling the quality of new stock listings, and the IPO is unlikely to resume in the near future. But a negative news that the non-hedging daily reduction of 4.33 billion yuan in February, which is the highest in a year, still made the market feel a little chill. From the flow of institutional funds, after three consecutive days of running out of the venue this week, institutions continued to flee in the morning today. According to statistics, the net outflow of institutional funds in the morning session of the Shanghai market reached about 3.1 billion. This suggests that institutions have become cautious about the outlook for the market after a sharp rebound, and are selling off their holdings at high prices, leaving the risk to small and medium investors who are rushing to enter the market. Technically, the major indices are currently in a short-term overbought condition according to multiple technical indicators. In particular, the KDJ indicator has just crossed down from a high level, and the MACD red bar has started to shorten, indicating that the adjustment of the market may need some time. However, due to the short-term and medium-term moving averages turning up and the bottom continuously rising, a strong technical support has already been formed for the future market. That is, after the necessary callbacks, the major index still has the momentum to advance. In summary, although the Shanghai Composite Index tested 2300 points and continued to stand above 2245 points yesterday, the fact that institutions are accelerating their reduction of positions also indicates that the risk of a short-term rebound in the market is relatively high. In addition, the volatile performance of the peripheral markets also requires the market to make a sufficient adjustment to digest some of the profit-taking and trapped positions before it can have enough momentum to continue its advance. In the morning session, the Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 5-day moving average, with trading volume shrinking, indicating that the market will enter a short-term consolidation phase. Looking ahead to the afternoon, a larger possibility of continued oscillation.

工银国际：中海集运第3季业绩失望工银国际马云鹏中海集运公布的第3季业绩欠佳，净亏损9.51亿人民币，对比去年同期净利润为22亿人民币。1-9月未经审核净亏损约为16亿人民币，超出我们估计的12亿人民币全年亏损。我们分别调低2011年美国和欧洲航线运费20%和13%，修订盈测后预计2011和2012年净亏损分别为27亿人民币和29亿人民币。中海集运现估值0.6倍2011和2012年预计市净率远低于过往平均1.0倍水平。鉴于估值偏低，我们维持“持有”评级，目标价1.95港元，相当于0.7倍11年预计市净率。第3季业绩失望。中海集运公布的第3季业绩欠佳，净亏损9.51亿人民币，对比去年同期净利润为22亿人民币。我们之前预期第3季旺季期间贸易量和运费会受全球贸易环境疲软影响按年下跌，但中海集运的第3季业绩较我们预期更差。1-9月未经审核净亏损约为16亿人民币，超出我们估计的12亿人民币全年亏损。第3季贸易总量同比下降0.1%，其中美国和欧洲航线贸易量分别同比下降25%和0.3%，而收益则分别减少47%和45%。前景仍不明朗。第3季平均上海出口集装箱运费率指数(SCFI)较上半年下降2%，其中美国和欧洲航线分别下降23%和7%。我们认为欧洲首脑会议达成债务危机解决方案短期内或可刺激运费上升。不过由于全球经济前景不明朗，尤其是欧洲贸易量和运费，我们认为第4季业绩好转的机会不大，明年展望亦会比较差。中海集运订造更多新船。公司订造12艘1,000个标准箱运载量的新船，总投资11亿美元。由于公司现时只有8艘同类型货轮，我们认为新船将加强公司欧美航线业务的竞争力。同时我们认为欧洲航线的竞争激烈逼使公司订购大型船舶，因在现时疲软市况下只有1,000个标准箱运载量的船舶能赚钱。鉴于现时订造新船价格仍低，加上中海集运现时负债比率约为40%，我们认为中海集运短期内不会有流动资金的问题。估值和评级。由于上半年航运市场疲软，我们分别下调美国和欧洲航线运量和平均运费预测，并相应调低2011年盈测至净亏损27亿人民币(之前为12亿人民币)。中海集运现估值0.6倍2011年预计市净率，估值远低于过往平均1.0倍水平。我们维持“持有”评级，目标价由2.1港元调低至1.95港元，相当于0.7倍11年预计市净率，较过往平均水平低1个标准差，因我们认为航运市场处于下降周期。	马云鹏	负向	ICBC International: Disappointing third quarter results for COSCO Shipping Containers ICBC International Ma Yunpeng COSCO Shipping Containers announced its third quarter results, which were disappointing, with a net loss of 951 million RMB, compared to a net profit of 2.2 billion RMB in the same period last year. Unaudited net loss for the first nine months was approximately RMB1.6 billion, exceeding our estimate of a full-year loss of RMB1.2 billion. We reduced the freight rates for US and European routes by 20% and 13% respectively in 2011, and after revising our earnings forecasts, we expect net losses of RMB2.7 billion and RMB2.9 billion in 2011 and 2012, respectively. China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company's current valuation is 0.6 times the expected P/B ratio for 2011 and 2012, which is much lower than the historical average of 1.0 times. Given the undemanding valuation, we maintain our “Hold” rating with a target price of HKD1.95, equivalent to 0.7x P/B for 11E. The third quarter performance was disappointing. COSCO's third quarter performance was poor, with a net loss of 951 million RMB, compared to a net profit of 2.2 billion RMB in the same period last year. We had expected trade volumes and freight rates to decline year-on-year during the third quarter’s peak season, affected by a weak global trade environment, but COSCO’s third quarter performance was worse than we expected. Unaudited net loss for the first nine months was approximately RMB1.6 billion, exceeding our estimate of a full-year loss of RMB1.2 billion. Trade volume in the third quarter declined by 0.1% year on year, with the trade volume on the US and European routes declining by 25% and 0.3% respectively, while the profits declined by 47% and 45% respectively. The outlook remains unclear. The average Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) for the third quarter declined by 2% compared to the first half of the year, with a 23% decline for the US route and a 7% decline for the European route. We believe that a debt crisis resolution reached at the European summit in the short term could boost freight rates. However, given the gloomy global economic outlook, especially in terms of trade and freight rates in Europe, we do not expect the fourth quarter performance to improve, and the outlook for next year will also be worse. Sinotrans has ordered more new ships. The company has ordered 12 new ships with a container capacity of 1,000 standard boxes, with a total investment of $1.1 billion. As the company currently has only 8 ships of the same type, we believe that the new ship will strengthen the competitiveness of the company's transatlantic business. We also believe that competition on the European route is so intense that it is forcing companies to order large vessels, as only those with a capacity of 1,000 twenty-foot equivalent units can make money in the current soft market. Given that the price of new ships is still low at present, and that COSCO's current debt ratio is about 40%, we believe that COSCO will not have a liquidity problem in the short term. Valuation and rating. Due to the weak shipping market in the first half of the year, we have reduced our forecast of cargo volume and average freight rates for the US and European routes, and accordingly lowered our earnings forecast for 2011 to a net loss of 2.7 billion RMB (previously 1.2 billion RMB). China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co. is currently valued at 0.6 times its 2011 estimated price-to-book ratio, which is far lower than the historical average of 1.0 times. We maintain our “Hold” rating, with the target price cut from HK$2.1 to HK$1.95, equivalent to 0.7x 2011 forecast P/B, 1 standard deviation below the historical average, as we believe the shipping market is in a down cycle.

On November 1, at the press conference of the ""Zha Zha Awards"", Chen Weiting revealed that he played with Sa Sa until 6 a.m., and both of them were still a little reluctant to part ways after they separated. Carly had to return to the mainland for work immediately, so she could not attend the press conference on November 1st together. Was it asked whether阿Sa had specially flown back to Hong Kong to spend Halloween with him? He said, ""To a certain extent, that is true."" When the reporter said that she kissed him, he smiled happily. Are you saying that we have to talk on the phone every day even if we don't meet in person? He said, ""Yes, let each side tell the other about their situation!"" She knew that she would have to shoot the White Snake Legend in the mainland, including flying, diving, and going underground. Is it painful? It's just a little bit, but she is a professional actress. Will she not be allowed to kiss the male lead? What I approve of, I will also watch her kissing scenes.

Sales growth matches the 25% and 24% order growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Due to the increase in the average retail price of shoes and clothing products, the overall gross margin increased by 2.2 percentage points to 39.9%. Sales and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 15.1% in the first half of 2010 to 17.6%, mainly due to the rise in promotional expenses, administrative personnel expenses, R&D expenses, and the addition of urban construction tax. The company added 395 net retail outlets in the first half of the year, bringing the total number of retail stores to 7,619. The orders at the company's first quarter trade fair grew by 20.5%, still quite fast. The wholesale discount adjustment starting in 2012 has further improved the company's gross margin. We maintain our EPS forecasts for the company at RMB0.482/0.573/0.679 for 2011-13. Currently, Piqua's valuation is 6.9 times the 2011 forecast P/E. Given the market concerns over overcapacity and uncertainties in the sporting goods industry, we maintain our collection rating but cut the target price to HK$4.70, implying an 8x P/E multiple for 2011.

反弹受阻3000点附近或再次蓄势德邦证券上周市场的走势基本验证我们上周的周策略报告，即市场短期反弹空间已经有限，难言系统性机会。从上周的走势看前三个交易日市场震荡小幅度上扬，不断趋近市场的关键技术阻力位，在周四达到重要的技术点位即3100点(沪指)时市场即出现明显压力，当天市场出现较大幅度回调，同时受到短期获利盘的抛压，导致当天市场放量大跌，成交量创了近期的天量，沪市成交量达1467亿元，深市也达到1157亿元。市场在关键技术点位受阻导致市场的反弹暂时夭折，从市场表现看，我们偏向于认为市场再次蓄势概率增加，同时市场的向好在等待政策的进一步明朗。从上周总体情况看，基本面偏于平静，政策面偶有因为两会的召开而刺激个别板块和行业的情况，而市场难有大的起落：上周沪深两市成交量分别6499亿元和4922亿元，较前一周均出现了超过20%的放量，但是受到关键点位的压制，同时短期获利了结的涌出市场出现下幅度回调，沪指下跌20.88点，幅度为-0.68%，而同期深圳指数下跌0.76%，市场再次蓄势的态势明显。从行业的表现看，上周仅有两个行业指数出现逆势上涨，其他所有行业指数均出现一致性的回调。两个上涨的版块分别为水电指数和建筑业指数，两者分别上涨了1.16%和0.09%；而下调的行业指数整体跌幅大多温和，下跌超过2%的行业为采掘指数，下跌为2.53%。而两外的指数多数下跌幅度在-0.5%到-1.5%之间，因此整体上市场处于温和调整状态。另外市场概念性的热点主要由政策利引导和推动，包括产业转移、区域振兴、新能源、节能环保、等均属于政策性的概念性交易机会。而本周将公布经济数据，而宏观调控政策明朗之前市场缺乏足够的做多动能。本周我们认为蓄势的概率较大，未来再次上行很可能将以明朗的政策信号为契机。同时坚持认为3月份仍然为调整的月份，二季度的行情仍然值得期待。因此短期看，我们认为市场再次上涨之前需要再次蓄势，而市场的很可能围绕着3000点附近进行，投资者立足于长远可以适当关注年报存在高分配预期的优质公司，同时重点关注具有明显的区域政策受益的中西部概念板块的交易性机会。但总体上依然注意仓位控制。就市场政策面看，虽然整体政策依然强积极的财政政策和适度宽松的货币政策，但从地产政策的调控来看结构微调可能会超出市场的预期，而地产调控政策的细化可能依然导致地产类股票的反弹的进度，从而整体上延后市场的系统上扬。正值两会的召开的当下，许多提案直指房产的高价，而各商业银行对地产的房贷政策的收紧很可能导致成交量难以出现实质性好转。而房地产业波及的行业板块较广，因此政策尚不明朗依然市场难有持续上扬的机会的重要因素。此外市场的流动性在二季度之前恐怕难有好转，一方面政策打击突击放贷，另一方面资本市场，特别是IPO市场持续分流资金这将对二级市场形成一定抑制。另外从基本面看，市场已经预期到了09年行业公司业绩大幅度回升的事实，但是对于10年依然存在诸多不确定因素，特别是国家宏观政策尚未明朗之前，各行业的业绩前景依然不过清晰，这是制约市场持续反弹的又一基本面的因素。因此我们认为短期市场恐难有系统性的机会，加之海外主权债务危机以及英镑的贬值等因素可能导致外围市场更加动荡，特别是近期美国贸易保护主义的愈演愈烈之势可能严重影响到中国外贸形势，因此国际上的不确定性是市场担忧的另一重要因素。所以总体来看，虽然年报出来的公司的业绩依然不断利好，但是市场各方面的担忧依然制约市场持续反弹，而且目前的A股估值水平出现了一定的结构性泡沫，特别是中小盘股的估值泡沫已经透支了其具有的增长能力，而政策对资产价格泡沫表现出严重关注，同时对通货膨胀都保持警惕。综合政策、资金和基本面的分析市场目前尚不具备持续上涨的动力，短期依然持保守态度。从技术角度来看，上周大盘反弹在关键技术位3100点(沪市)受阻，由此引发大盘可能再次回到3000点附近形成蓄势态势，同时也将形成市场二次筑底的形态。首先从形态看，市场经过持续反弹后已经反弹到前期三重头部的颈线位置即沪市的3100点，而上周四刚过3100点市场即引发了一次较为剧烈的下跌，因此市场再次回调蓄势甚至可能形成二次筑底的走势，而上周上涨受阻的位置同时是半年线位置，也是120周线位置，因此技术上属于关键的点位，该点位的技术压力明显，担起难以有效突破前期的技术颈线。其次从量能看，经过连续两周放量反弹后本周在关键位置出现放量回调，因此，这种量价的背离一定程度表前期的阶段性底部依然不扎实，市场有再次蓄势的必要，而超短期周五的走势看，量能再次显著萎缩，沪市从1400多亿元的成交快速萎缩到1000余亿元的成交表明当前杀跌力量也快速减弱。因此量能上分析市场当属于回调蓄势走势，本周在3000点附近蓄势的概率显著增加。最后，从技术指标看，虽然MACD指标依然处在0轴线之下的弱势阶段，但是，中短线显示持续上扬之势，两者均在持续向0的位置靠拢。而RSI、ADR和KDJ指标已经进入强势区间，飒三者的走势更趋于强势后的回调确认。因此，综合而言，我们认为市场回调蓄势的概率更高，一旦市场政策等因素明朗，大盘仍将震荡上扬。	飒	正向	Bounce Stopped Near 3000 Points or Recharge DGB Securities last week's market performance basically verified our weekly strategy report last week, that is, the market's short-term rebound space is limited and it is difficult to speak of systemic opportunities. Based on the trend of the past week, the market showed a slight upward fluctuation in the first three trading days, approaching the key technical resistance level of the market. When the market reached the important technical point of 3100 points (Shanghai Composite Index) on Thursday, there was obvious pressure on the market. On that day, the market experienced a significant adjustment, and at the same time, the market was affected by the short-term profit-taking pressure, leading to a large volume of market decline, with trading volume reaching a record high. The turnover of the Shanghai market reached 146.7 billion yuan, and the turnover of the Shenzhen market also reached 115.7 billion yuan. The market's rebound was temporarily aborted due to resistance at key technical levels, and from the market's performance, we tend to believe that the probability of the market accumulating strength again is increasing, while the market's improvement is waiting for further clarification of policy. From the overall situation of last week, the basic face is relatively calm, and the policy face is occasionally stimulated by the convening of the two sessions, and the market is difficult to have a large fluctuation: last week, the turnover of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets was 6499 billion yuan and 4922 billion yuan, respectively, and the turnover increased by more than 20% compared with the previous week, but it was suppressed by key points, and at the same time, the short-term profit-taking out of the market caused a large degree of adjustment, the Shanghai Composite Index fell by 20.88 points, the amplitude was -0.68%, and the Shenzhen Index fell by 0.76% at the same time, the market's tendency to accumulate strength is obvious again. From the performance of the industry, only two industry indices showed a counter-trend increase last week, while all other industry indices experienced a consistent correction. Two sectors, the hydroelectric power index and the construction index, rose by 1.16% and 0.09% respectively, while the overall decline of the industry index was generally mild, with the mining index falling by 2.53%. The other indices fell by more than -0.5% to -1.5%, so the market as a whole was in a mild adjustment. Another market concept hotspot is mainly guided and promoted by policies, including industrial transfer, regional revitalization, new energy, energy conservation and environmental protection, etc., which all belong to policy-driven conceptual trading opportunities. And this week, economic data will be released, and the market lacks sufficient momentum to go long before macro-control policies become clear. We believe that the probability of a build-up is relatively high this week, and a clear policy signal may serve as a catalyst for a further upward move in the future. And it also insists that March is still a month for adjustment, and the performance of the second quarter is still worth looking forward to. Thus, in the short term, we believe that the market needs to consolidate again before it can rise again, and the market is likely to hover around the 3000 point level. Investors, with a long-term perspective, can appropriately pay attention to high dividend distribution expectations in quality companies, while paying close attention to the trading opportunities of the central and western regions benefiting from obvious regional policies. But overall, still pay attention to position control. From the perspective of market policy, although the overall policy is still strongly positive fiscal policy and moderately loose monetary policy, from the regulation of real estate policy, structural fine-tuning may exceed the market's expectations. The detailed regulation of real estate control policy may still lead to a rebound in real estate stocks, thereby delaying the overall upward trend of the market. With the convening of the Two Sessions, many proposals directly point to the high price of housing, and the tightening of mortgage policies by commercial banks may make it difficult for transaction volumes to show substantive improvement. And the real estate industry affects a wide range of industries, so the lack of clear policy is still an important factor that makes it difficult for the market to have a sustained upward trend. Moreover, market liquidity is unlikely to improve before the second quarter, as policy measures to curb the rush of lending continue to divert capital, and the capital market, especially the IPO market, continues to siphon off funds, which will suppress the secondary market. From a fundamental perspective, the market has already anticipated the fact that the performance of the industry companies will significantly recover in 2009, but there are still many uncertain factors for 2010, especially before the national macro policy is clear, the performance prospects of various industries are still not clear, which is another fundamental factor that restrains the continuous rebound of the market. Thus, we believe that the short-term market is unlikely to have systematic opportunities, and factors such as the sovereign debt crisis abroad and the depreciation of the pound may lead to greater instability in the peripheral markets, especially the recent escalation of US trade protectionism may seriously affect China's foreign trade situation, so the uncertainty on the international stage is another important factor of market concerns. So overall, although the performance of the companies that have released their annual reports is still continuously favorable, market concerns on all fronts still restrict the market from a sustained rebound. Currently, the valuation of A-shares has shown a certain degree of structural bubble, especially the valuation bubble of small and medium-sized stocks has already overestimated their growth potential. At the same time, the policy is paying serious attention to the bubble in asset prices, and is also vigilant about inflation. Taking into account the analysis of integrated policies, funds, and fundamentals, the market currently lacks the momentum for sustained upward movement, and a conservative attitude will still be maintained in the short term. Technically speaking, the rebound of the major market last week was blocked at the key technical level of 3100 points (Shanghai market), which may lead to a rebound to around 3000 points, forming a consolidation pattern, and also forming a pattern of the market's second bottom formation. First, from the form, the market has rebounded to the neckline of the previous triple head after a continuous rebound, which is 3100 points of the Shanghai market. Last Thursday, the market triggered a relatively violent decline after just passing 3100 points. Therefore, the market may form a secondary bottom formation after a second adjustment and consolidation. The position where the market was blocked last week is also the position of the half-year line and the 120-week line. Therefore, technically, it is a key point. The technical pressure at this point is obvious, but it is difficult to effectively break through the technical neckline of the previous period. Second, from the perspective of volume, after a two-week volume rebound, this week showed a volume adjustment at a key position. Therefore, this divergence between volume and price to some extent indicates that the phase bottom in the early stage is still not solid, and the market has the need to consolidate again. From the perspective of short-term volume on Friday, the volume has significantly shrunk again. The Shanghai market's trading volume has shrunk from more than 140 billion yuan to more than 100 billion yuan, indicating that the current selling pressure has also weakened rapidly. Thus, in terms of capacity, the market analysis should belong to a consolidation pattern, and the probability of consolidation near the 3000-point level this week is significantly increased. Finally, from the technical indicators, although the MACD indicator is still in a weak phase below the zero line, the medium and short-term lines show a continuous upward trend, and both are moving towards the zero position. And the RSI, ADR, and KDJ indicators have entered the strong zone, and the three are more likely to be a confirmation of the adjustment after the strong trend. Thus, in summary, we believe that the probability of a market correction is higher, and the market will still fluctuate upwards once the market policies and other factors become clear.
分析：WiMAX“屈尊”加入3G混战本报记者黄沙10月19日，国际电信联盟ITU在日内瓦举行无线通信RadioAssembly全体会议，与会国家通过投票正式通过，无线宽带技术WiMAX正式成为3G标准。WiMAX论坛在白皮书中称，将移动WiMAX加入到3G家族，为运营商升级网络提供了一条新的途径。“移动WiMAX正式成为3G技术之后，服务提供商在部署网络和推出服务时可以获得更多选择和更大灵活度。例如，它们可以在人口稀少的地区提供接入服务，或者在人口密集的地区提供增强接入服务。此外，全球开放标准有助于提升不同设备之间的互用性，降低设备成本，从而服务提供商将从中获益。”WiMAX的尴尬作为一项被认为是高于现有3G标准的“准4G”标准，WiMAX从诞生之日起就一直夺人眼目。WiMAX，即IEEE802.16x，全称叫做“微波存取全球互通技术(WorldwideInteroperabilityforMicrowaveAccess)”。和传统的TD-SCDMA、WCDMA和CDMA2000几个3G标准相比，WiMAX的最大传输半径达到了50公里上下，接近前者的两倍。而在传输速度上，WiMAX也让其他3G标准望尘莫及。在10公里范围内，WiMAX网络的带宽可以达到70Mbps，甚至超过了ADSL等有线网络的技术，而主流的无线GPRS最高传输速度是115Kbps，3G标准中的TD-SCDMA和WCDMA则均为2Mbps.随着技术的升级，WiMAX从2005年开始更分化出了802.16D和802.16E两个版本。802.16D为固定无线网络，能够作为wifi的升级直接与现有固定有线网络结合，受到了世界各地的欢迎。而移动无线网络802.16E却和移动运营商的现有网络发生了直接的对抗。然而就是这样一个含着金钥匙出生的标准，在提升移动性的同时却发现面临着没有频谱资源的严重问题。要在移动通讯领域争夺市场，最重要的一点就是要有一个全球统一的频段。但由于早在2001年4月，ITU就将最合适的频段都已经分配给全球三大3G标准WCDMA、CDMA2000和中国提出的TD-SCDMA.更要命的是，由于提交3G方案的截止日期早在1998年就已到期，按照ITU的惯例，3G标准已经冻结，不得其门而入的WiMAX面临着没有频段的尴尬。而没有频段，这项无线宽带技术完全无法实现区间漫游，而这对移动通讯网络来说是致命的。抵制在全球的4G标准迟迟没有确立，而3G网络建设如火如荼的情况下，WiMAX阵营坐不住了。从今年起，美国政府和WiMAX阵营的各家厂商展开了强大的公关游说工作，希望将WiMAX“降格”加入3G标准，在现有的市场上分一杯羹。据相关专家透露，从今年初起国际电联开始研究“OFDMATDDWMAN(802.16e，WiMAX的移动模式)”空中接口技术成为IMT-2000标准的可能性。但对于WiMAX申请加入3G标准，代表了此前3G三大阵营WCDMA和CDMA2000和TD-SCDMA的爱立信、高通和TD三方进行了强力抵制，而德国和中国等国家也表示了反对。展讯通信有限公司副总裁曹强博士认为，相比TD-SCDMA和其他3G标准，尽管WiMAX在造价、建网速度以及业务接入能力等方面存在着不可比拟的优势，但是WiMAX也存在着先天不足的尴尬局面。WiMAX支持移动性方面系统信令开销过大，小区边缘能力低；MobileWiMAX和FixedWiMAX在物理层面不兼容；标准化不全面，仅集中在L1和L2，缺少射频规范；标准化机制不健全，频繁的投票机制难以保证其完整性考虑；过多的选项导致系统开销增加和不稳定性，此外还存在着产品互通性差等问题。妥协与博弈但在各大利益集团的相互游说和妥协下，WiMAX阵营与政府、运营商、设备供应商和其他技术寻求合作，形成了一套“远交近攻”的频谱战略。目前3G无线网络的频段分为FDD(频分双工FrequencyDivisionDuplex)和TDD(时分双工TimeDivisionDuplex)两类，WCDMA、CDMA2000分享了FDD的频段，而TD-SCDMA则独占了TDD频段，而WiMAX在上述两种频段都能够使用。为了获得WCDMA、CDMA2000阵营的支持，WiMAX方面最终放弃了FDD频段。而对于支持TD-SCDMA的中国，WiMAX阵营也进行了紧锣密鼓的宣传攻关，连续2年将高规格的“WiMAX全球峰会”放在北京召开。在强大的公关下，WiMAX势如破竹地获得了多数阵营的支持。今年1月底，国际电信联盟8F工作组在喀麦隆举行会谈，着重讨论WiMAX成为3G中的一员；6月初ITU日本京都会议上，WiMAX技术顺利地通过了工作组级别的讨论；到了10月19日，ITU正式宣布，已经批准WiMAX成为ITU移动无线标准，即与WCDMA、CDMA2000和TD-SCDMA并列成为全球3G标准。在最终的方案中，ITU将WiMAX列为时分双工TDD(TimeDivisionDuplex)技术，和TD-SCDMA分享这一频段，TD-SCDMA阵营则成了最大的输家。“WiMAX成为3G标准堵死了TD国际化道路。”资深通信专家项立刚认为，WiMAX对于其他几个3G标准而言是竞争者，会瓜分掉部分市场，但对我国提出的TD标准而言，是一次重大打击。不过，WiMAX虽已被接纳为3G标准，但还在等待ITU为其指派频谱资源，博弈还在继续。	黄沙,曹强,项立刚	正向	"Analysis: WiMAX ""deigns"" to join the 3G battle. Huang Sha, reporter. On October 19, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) held a Radio Assembly meeting in Geneva, and the wireless broadband technology WiMAX was officially recognized as a 3G standard after a vote by the participating countries. The WiMAX Forum refers to adding mobile WiMAX to the 3G family as a new way for operators to upgrade their networks in the white paper. After the launch of mobile WiMAX, service providers will have more options and flexibility when deploying networks and launching services after 3G technology. For example, they can provide access services in sparsely populated areas, or enhanced access services in densely populated areas. In addition, global open standards can help improve interoperability between different devices, reduce device costs, and thus benefit service providers. WiMAX, as an “almost 4G” standard considered to be superior to the existing 3G standards, has always been eye-catching since its birth. WiMAX, which is IEEE802.16x, is a full name of ""Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)"". Compared with the several 3G standards, such as traditional TD-SCDMA, WCDMA and CDMA2000, the maximum transmission radius of WiMAX is about 50 kilometers, which is nearly twice that of the former. In terms of transmission speed, WiMAX also leaves other 3G standards far behind. Within a 10-kilometer range, the bandwidth of the WiMAX network can reach 70Mbps, even surpassing the technology of ADSL and other wired networks, while the mainstream wireless GPRS has a maximum transmission speed of 115Kbps, and the TD-SCDMA and WCDMA standards in the 3G standard are both 2Mbps. With the upgrade of technology, WiMAX has been further divided into 802.16D and 802.16E versions since 2005. 802.16D is a fixed wireless network that can be directly combined with existing fixed wired networks as an upgrade to WiFi and has been welcomed worldwide. And the mobile Wi-Fi 802.16E clashed directly with mobile operators' existing networks. However, this standard, born with a golden key, found itself facing a serious problem of lacking spectrum resources while mobility was being improved. To compete in the mobile communications market, the most important thing is to have a globally unified frequency band. But by April 2001, the ITU had already allocated the most suitable frequency bands to the global three major 3G standards, WCDMA, CDMA2000, and TD-SCDMA, which China proposed. What was even worse was that, since the deadline for submitting 3G proposals had expired as early as 1998, according to the ITU's convention, the 3G standards had already been frozen, leaving WiMAX, which could not enter through the door, in a difficult situation without any frequency bands. Without bands, this wireless broadband technology cannot achieve roaming, which is fatal to mobile communication networks. The WiMAX camp could not sit still with the 4G global standard still in the making, while 3G networks were being built up by storm. Starting this year, the US government and various vendors in the WiMAX camp have launched a powerful public relations and lobbying campaign to lower WiMAX to the 3G standard and get a piece of the existing market. According to relevant experts, the ITU has begun to study the possibility of OFDMATDDWMAN (802.16e, the mobile mode of WiMAX) air interface technology becoming the IMT-2000 standard since the beginning of this year. But for WiMAX to apply to join the 3G standard, Ericsson, Qualcomm and TD, the three parties of WCDMA and CDMA2000 and TD-SCDMA, strongly resisted, and Germany and China and other countries also expressed opposition. Dr. Cao Qiang, vice president of Spreadtrum Communications, believes that although WiMAX has incomparable advantages in terms of cost, network construction speed, and service access capability, compared with TD-SCDMA and other 3G standards, WiMAX also has an awkward situation of inherent disadvantages. WiMAX has a large system signaling overhead and low cell edge capability in terms of mobility support; MobileWiMAX and FixedWiMAX are not compatible at the physical layer; the standardization is incomplete, focusing only on L1 and L2, and lacks RF specifications; the standardization mechanism is not sound, and the frequent voting mechanism is difficult to ensure its integrity; too many options lead to increased system overhead and instability, and there are also issues such as poor product interoperability. Compromise and bargaining, but under the mutual lobbying and compromise among various interest groups, the WiMAX camp cooperated with the government, operators, equipment suppliers, and other technologies to form a ""far alliance, near attack"" spectrum strategy. Currently, the frequency bands of 3G wireless networks are divided into FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) and TDD (Time Division Duplex). WCDMA and CDMA2000 share the FDD frequency bands, while TD-SCDMA exclusively uses the TDD frequency bands. WiMAX can use both of the above frequency bands. In order to gain the support of the WCDMA and CDMA2000 camps, WiMAX finally abandoned the FDD frequency band. And for China, which supports TD-SCDMA, the WiMAX camp also carried out intensive promotional efforts, holding the high-profile ""WiMAX Global Summit"" in Beijing for two consecutive years. With strong PR, WiMAX swept the majority of the camps. At the end of January this year, the ITU 8F working group held talks in Cameroon, focusing on the discussion of WiMAX becoming a member of 3G; at the ITU meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in early June, WiMAX technology passed the working group level discussion smoothly; by October 19, the ITU officially announced that WiMAX had been approved as an ITU mobile wireless standard, that is, it had become one of the global 3G standards along with WCDMA, CDMA2000 and TD-SCDMA. In the final solution, ITU listed WiMAX as a Time Division Duplex (TDD) technology, sharing the frequency band with TD-SCDMA, and the TD-SCDMA camp became the biggest loser. WiMAX has become a standard that blocks the internationalization of TD. Senior communications expert Xiang Ligang believes that WiMAX is a competitor to other 3G standards, which will take away some of the market, but for the TD standard proposed by China, it is a major blow. However, WiMAX, although accepted as a 3G standard, is still waiting for the ITU to assign it spectrum resources, and the game is still on."
科比坐板凳把手感坐凉一打五暴扣仍难敌群狼发威新浪体育讯　北京时间11月6日，洛杉矶湖人队坐镇主场，迎战同城对手快船。这不过是湖人本赛季的四场比赛，但已经是第二次洛城德比了。湖人之前战胜掘金迎来三连胜，而在休整了几天之后，紫金军团又要上路了。一周前的第一场洛城德比，快船遭遇惨败，而今天拜伦-戴维斯希望复仇，也渴望拿下他来快船后的第一场胜利。而跟第一战不同的是，昔日联盟最佳防守球员坎比今天也首发出场，双塔对拼也是一大看点。快船对湖人，当第一节结束而分差在5分之内的时候，第二节会发生什么？毫无疑问，湖人会马上取得领先，因为他们有一帮活力四射的替补杀手。第二节的替补时刻是湖人的常规节目，拉马尔-奥多姆带着一帮替补，外加拜纳姆镇守内线，法玛尔和武贾西奇两个白人小个提供外围火力，这样的阵容果然奏效，第二节开始不过5分钟就把比分反超了5分。当然这跟两队上一场相遇时的情况有些不同，那次湖人他替补们的表现更加恐怖，不过反超比分总算是他们完成了任务。第二节还剩6分钟湖人重新派上科比加索尔，但小飞侠在板凳上坐了半天手感受到了影响，几次尝试自己进攻都没能命中。双方陷入苦战，得分都变得异常艰难。而在湖人用罚球连续得到4分之后，快船卷土重来了。戴维斯漂亮的抢断加索尔发动快攻轻松拿分，接着又是外线射手发炮，比分瞬间被反超。而科比则陷入低迷，他想要站出来接管比赛，但一次投篮在干扰之下弹筐而出，一次更是被逼到篮板后面投出三不沾。	科比,拜伦-戴维斯,戴维斯,坎比,拉马尔-奥多姆,拜纳姆,法玛尔,武贾西奇,加索尔	正向	Kobe sat on the bench and felt the touch cool. He still couldn't resist the wolves' power. In a 5-on-1, he still couldn't resist the wolves' power. Sina Sports News, November 6, 2018, Los Angeles Lakers played at home and faced the local rival, the Clippers. This was only four games for the Lakers this season, but it was the second time for the Los Angeles rivalry. The Lakers had won three consecutive games against the Nuggets and were about to hit the road again after a few days of rest. Last week's first Los Angeles derby, the Clippers suffered a heavy defeat, and today Byron Davis hopes to take revenge and also hopes to win his first victory since joining the Clippers. Unlike the first game, where former All-Defensive Player, Candi, also started today, and the showdown of the two towers is also a highlight. What will happen in the second quarter when the Clippers play against the Lakers and the score difference is within 5 points at the end of the first quarter? There is no doubt that the Lakers will take the lead immediately, because they have a group of energetic bench killers. The Lakers' regular substitute moment in the second period was a routine, with Lamar Odom leading a group of substitutes, with Bynum guarding the interior, and Farrow and Vujacic, two white small guards, providing firepower from the outside. The lineup really worked, and the Lakers took the lead by 5 points in just 5 minutes of the second period. Of course, it was different from the last time the two teams met, when the Lakers' substitutes performed even more terrifyingly, but they finally completed their task of reversing the score. With 6 minutes left in the second half, the Lakers brought back Kobe and Gasol, but the Little Flying侠 sat on the bench for a long time, and his hand was affected. He tried to attack himself several times, but he failed to hit. Both sides are fighting hard, and it is extremely difficult to score. After the Lakers scored 4 consecutive points from the free throws, the Clippers came back. Davis' pretty steal and a fast break layup by Gasol, followed by a three-point shot by the shooter, and the score was instantly reversed. While Kobe was in a slump, he wanted to step up and take over the game, but a shot was deflected and rimmed out, and another was a three-bounce off the backboard.
考研专业课最后十天冲刺：把握书本分析真题我们都知道这样一个规律：一般来说，公共课的复习效果不及专业课的复习效果快，投入相同的时间，成绩的增长量却并不相同。公共课像政治和英语，即使你花费再多的精力，在考试中也有可能很难获得很高的分数。因此，万学•海文建议众学子们：考研复习后期，在保证一定量政治、英语的复习时间上，在保证通过学校最低分数线的基础上，应多投入时间到专业课复习上。专业课的高分意味着你通过初试的几率增大。因此，提高专业课成绩，是提高考研总分的唯一途径。在距离考试的这最后十天的时间里，关于专业课的复习，希望大家注意以下两点：把握书本有些考生使用的是其他版本的专业课参考书，如果是这样，我建议您在考试前看一遍指定参考书。指定参考书是考试出题的依据，里面的一些内容是其他版本的参考书上没有的，或者比其他版本的参考书阐述的更全面，考生要熟悉这些新内容。考生可以看着指定参考书的目录，回想自己对某一章节的掌握程度，当发现某些知识遗忘了或者模糊时，打开书熟悉巩固一下。考试是有重点的，什么是重点，什么是非重点，可以根据历年考题，课后习题，课堂笔记，辅导班讲义等判断。考生应该花较多的时间在经常考的重点内容上。当然也不能忽视一些小字内容，一些不常考的知识,应该投入小部分时间在这些内容上,确保知识的完整性。分析真题理科考生的专业课考试中往往涉及很多计算。如果以前已经做过很多题目，现在可以不必埋头做很多新题目，可以花一些时间看以前做过的题目，想题目的解题思路、解题技巧、注意事项等。如果在以前的复习中，大部分时间都花在看书上，题目做的很少，现在就需要做一些题目。因为读懂了书，并不意味着能快速做题，能做对题目。通过现在的做题，检测一下自己对某些知识的掌握程度。做题过程中，发现自己的不足后，应及时寻找解决办法。比如做题粗心，就应该试着细心；忘记公式，就应重背公式。做的题目不应很难，花半天时间做对一道题目是的不值得的，抓基础和重点才是关键。考生如有历年试卷，应仔细研读试卷中的题目，试卷是一面镜子，在一定程度上能反映今年的考题。甚至在专业课考试中，不同的年份，会有相同的考题出现。做往年试题时，要试着把握出题重点，掌握出题规律，熟悉做题方法。对于考本专业的同学，一定要充分重视自己的专业学习，不能以为自己学了四年就一定比别人强，不然很可能阴沟里翻船。专业课最容易得分也最容易失分，如果你答错或答偏了一个大题，可能一下就和别人拉开了近10分的距离。除了看考试用书外，要注意多阅览与本专业相关的论文，最重要的是，本专业的学生在复习时要学会用一种专家的眼光看待业内的一些问题，甚至包括自己的复习用书，要敢于审问、质疑。这样在答题时才会有新思路，不人云亦云，这是专业课得高分的关键。当然大家要注意掌握分寸，不要发挥得太离谱。对于跨专业的同学来说，应该早点去听所考专业的课程，这有两个好处：一是早点积累专业知识，培养专业感觉；二是通过听专业老师的授课，尽早自己要考哪个老师的研究生，可以直接向老师表明心迹，让老师熟悉你、了解你，这样一方面自己的专业学习能够有人指导，另一方面会让自己的复试时心里有底，顺利很多。不过，最后的这几天可能说这个已经为时已晚，希望能给2010年考研的同学一个参考吧。最后，希望大家利用这最后的十天时间把握住考研的重中之重，拿下专业课的高分，那么，进入复试的几率就会大大增加。加油，学子们！祝你们好运！更多信息请访问：新浪考研频道考研论坛考研博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。		正向	Postgraduate Entrance Examination Professional Course Ten-day Sprint: Grasp the Book and Analyze the Real Question We all know a rule: Generally speaking, the review effect of public courses is not as fast as that of professional courses. With the same amount of time, the increase in scores is not the same. General courses like politics and English, no matter how much effort you put in, you may still find it difficult to get high scores on the exam. Thus, Wankexue·Haiwen suggests to all students: in the later stage of postgraduate review, in addition to ensuring a certain amount of political and English review time, and ensuring passing the school's minimum score line, more time should be invested in the review of professional courses. High scores in specialized courses mean a higher chance of passing the preliminary examination. Therefore, improving the scores of professional courses is the only way to improve the total score of the postgraduate entrance examination. In the last ten days before the exam, in terms of reviewing the professional course, I hope everyone will pay attention to the following two points: grasp the book. Some candidates use other versions of the professional course reference books. If this is the case, I suggest you read the designated reference book before the exam. The reference book specified as the basis for the examination questions, some of which are not in other versions of the reference book, or are more comprehensive than other versions of the reference book, candidates should be familiar with these new contents. Examinees can look at the table of contents of the designated reference book, recall their mastery of a certain chapter, and when they find that some knowledge has been forgotten or is unclear, open the book to familiarize and consolidate it. The exam has a focus. What is the focus and what is not, can be judged by the questions of previous years, after-class exercises, class notes, tutoring class lecture notes, etc. Test takers should spend more time on the key content that is often tested. Of course, we should not ignore some minor content and less frequently tested knowledge, and invest a small amount of time in these contents to ensure the completeness of knowledge. In the professional course examination of science candidates in the real question, there are often many calculations involved. If you have done a lot of questions before, you do not need to do a lot of new questions now. You can spend some time on the questions you have done before, thinking about the problem solving ideas, problem solving skills, and precautions, etc. If most of the time was spent reading books during the previous review, and few questions were done, you need to do some questions now. Reading the book does not mean you can answer the questions quickly and correctly. To test the level of knowledge you have mastered through the current exercises. After finding your shortcomings while doing exercises, you should seek solutions in time. For example, if you are careless when doing exercises, you should try to be more careful; if you forget the formula, you should review it again. The problems should not be too difficult. It is not worth spending half a day to solve one problem. The key is to grasp the basics and the key points. If the examinee has old test papers, they should carefully read the questions in the test papers, as the test papers are a mirror to a certain extent and can reflect the questions of this year. Even in professional course exams, the same questions may appear in different years. When doing old test papers, try to grasp the key points of the questions, master the laws of the questions, and familiarize yourself with the methods of answering questions. For students who are studying their major, they must attach great importance to their professional studies and not think that they are definitely better than others just because they have studied for four years, or they may capsize in the ditches. Major courses are the easiest to score and lose points. If you answer a big question wrong or off-topic, you may be more than 10 points away from others in a moment. Besides reading the books for the exam, it is important to read more papers related to your major. Most importantly, students in your major should learn to view some issues in the field with an expert’s perspective, even including the books for your review. You should be brave enough to question and challenge. This will give you new ideas when answering questions, and not follow the crowd, which is the key to getting high scores in professional courses. Of course, everyone should pay attention to the measure and not exaggerate too much. For students from different majors, it is better to attend the courses of the major you are going to take the exam for as early as possible. There are two benefits: one is to accumulate professional knowledge and cultivate a sense of profession; the other is to listen to the lectures of the teachers of the major as early as possible, and choose which teacher's graduate students you want to take the exam for. You can directly express your feelings to the teacher, so that the teacher can get to know you and understand you. On the one hand, your professional learning can be guided by someone, and on the other hand, it will make you have a bottom in the re-examination, and it will be much smoother. But, in the last few days, it may be too late to say this, but I hope it can serve as a reference for the postgraduate entrance examination candidates in 2010. Finally, I hope that everyone can seize the last ten days to grasp the key of the postgraduate entrance examination, get high scores in professional courses, and thus greatly increase the chances of entering the re-examination. Go, students! Good luck to you!

何冲6年一冠超越熊倪彭勃成中国男板大满贯第1人新浪体育讯　谁是中国男子3米跳板第一位大满贯得主？答案是何冲，今晚他在罗马世锦赛决战中有惊无险地夺得该项目金牌，继08世界杯、奥运会后又一次走上3米板单人跳冠军领奖台，罗马世锦赛的成功，使他填补中国跳水的一项空白——男子3米跳板大满贯。奥运会跳水赛四个传统项目，跳水国手填补的最后一项空白就是男子跳板，1996年亚特兰大奥运会熊倪与队友余卓成分获3米跳板冠亚军，攻克中国跳水在当时奥运赛场上的最后一个障碍。四年后的悉尼奥运会，熊倪蝉联3米跳板单人跳冠军，他还与队友肖海亮成为历史上第一对男板双人跳冠军，为自己的运动生涯划上一个完美句号。不过，熊倪却未能实现男板大满贯荣誉，因为他在世锦赛、世界杯赛场未获得过一枚单人跳板金牌。第二位奥运会跳板冠军是彭勃，他是在雅典奥运会获得这一荣誉的。与熊倪一样，彭勃在另两项大赛也没有摘取单人跳金牌。其实，何冲本有希望在北京奥运会就可实现“男板第一人”梦想的。何冲有着高人一筹的身体素质，2005年十运会年仅18岁的他力压彭勃、王天凌、罗玉通等国内众多高手，出人意料地夺得男子1米板冠军和3米板亚军。更早些时候举行的05世锦赛，初涉世界三大赛的何冲与王峰联袂夺得3米跳板双人跳冠军，单人跳紧随德斯帕蒂、杜迈斯之后名列第三。凭借一系列国际比赛的杰出战绩，06常熟世界杯前夕何冲已成为国内男板第一人，角逐三米跳板单人、双人和一米跳板三个赛项。当时何冲的全套动作难度系数在世界属于顶尖水平，还掌握着高达成3.8的5156B，被誉为“难度王”。常熟战役，何冲夺得后两项冠军，但在含金量更足的三米板单人跳决赛中，赛前夺冠呼声最高的他却在107B动作发生重大失误，此跳被裁判亮了零分，最终仅获第5名。一年后的墨尔本世锦赛，何冲又一次因为失误与金牌失之交臂。前两轮领先的他在第三、四轮连续出现失误，名次一下子落到第十，最终仅获第6名。连续两次失利也使何冲在三米板的影响力被秦凯反超。去年2月在北京举行的世界杯跳水赛，是北京奥运会前最重要的一次热身赛，那次何冲没有让机遇溜走，最终以15分的优势击败秦凯，夺得自己第一枚金牌。这枚金牌的获得，也为何冲后来冲击08奥运会金牌增添信心，并为今天实现男板大满贯殊荣奠定了基础。(王全立)	何冲,熊倪,彭勃,余卓成,肖海亮,海亮,王天凌,罗玉通,王峰,德斯帕蒂,杜迈斯,秦凯,王全立	正向	"Who is the first male 3-meter springboard ""all-around"" champion in China? He Chong won the championship after 6 years, surpassing Xiong Ni and Peng Bo, becoming the first person to win all the major titles in men's diving in China. Sina Sports News. The answer is He Chong. He won the gold medal in the individual 3-meter springboard event at the World Championships in Rome tonight, and once again stood on the podium of the 3-meter springboard single event champion after the 2008 World Cup and the Olympics. The success of the World Championships in Rome has enabled him to fill a gap in Chinese diving - the Grand Slam of men's 3-meter springboard. The four traditional diving events of the Olympic Games, the last blank filled by diving players is the men's springboard. In the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, Xiong Ni and his teammate Yu Zhuofen won the first and second places in the 3-meter springboard, overcoming the last obstacle of Chinese diving on the Olympic stage at that time. Four years later, at the Sydney Olympics, Xiong Ni won the championship of the 3-meter springboard diving for the second time, and he and his teammate Xiao Hai Liang became the first male pair to win the championship of the springboard diving, putting a perfect end to his sports career. But, Bao Ni failed to achieve the grand slam of men's springboard events, as he had never won a single individual springboard gold medal at the World Championships or the World Cup. The second Olympic diving champion was Peng Bo, who won this honor at the Athens Olympic Games. Like Qiong Ni, Peng Bo did not win the individual gold medal in the other two major competitions. In fact, He Chong had the chance to realize his dream of being the first male diver in the Beijing Olympic Games. He Chong has superior physical fitness. In the 2005 Tenth National Games, at the age of 18, he outperformed many domestic top players such as Peng Bo, Wang Tianling, and Luo Yutong, and unexpectedly won the championship of the men's 1-meter board and the runner-up of the 3-meter board. At the earlier World Championships in 2005, He Chong and Wang Feng, who were making their debut in the World's Three Major Competitions, won the championship of the 3-meter springboard synchronized diving, and He Chong ranked third in the individual event after Deschamps and Dumais. With a series of outstanding performances in international competitions, He Chong had become the first man on the board in China before the 2006 World Cup in Changshu, competing in three events: the three-meter springboard, the three-meter springboard team, and the one-meter springboard. At that time, He Chong's full set of movements were at the top level of the world in terms of difficulty coefficient, and he mastered 5156B with a high completion rate of 3.8, and was known as the ""King of Difficulty"". Changshu campaign, He Chong won the two events, but in the final of the three-meter board individual competition, which had more gold, the one with the highest pre-competition championship was the major mistake in the 107B action, and this jump was given a score of zero by the referee, and finally only won the 5th place. At the World Championships in Melbourne a year later, He Chong missed out on the gold medal again due to a mistake. He led after the first two rounds, but made consecutive mistakes in the third and fourth rounds, and his position dropped to tenth. He ultimately finished in sixth place. Consecutive failures also made He Chong fall behind Qin Kai in the influence of the three-meter board. The World Cup Diving held in Beijing in February last year was the most important warm-up competition before the Beijing Olympic Games. At that time, He Chong did not let the opportunity slip away, and finally won the first gold medal by 15 points over Qin Kai. This gold medal also boosted his confidence to win a gold medal in the 2008 Olympic Games and laid a solid foundation for today's achievement of the male diving grand slam. (Wang Quanli)"
收盘：道指跌21点纳指跌9点新浪财经讯因政府报告显示九月份丧失工作人数高于预期，美股周五低收。劳工部表示，九月份共丧失26.3万个工作岗位，高于八月份20.1万个，也远高于经济学家的18万的预期，失业率上升至9.8%，创26年新高。就业报告通常被视为是一个月中最重要的经济报告，失业人数的减少是经济可持续复苏的关键。芝加哥IGMarkets资深市场分析师丹-库克(DanCook)指出，“过去两个月里投资者都以为就业市场已好转，显然，这不是事实。”截至收盘，道琼斯工业平均指数下跌了21.61点，报收9487.67点，跌幅为0.23%；纳斯达克综合指数下跌了9.37点，报收2048.11点，跌幅为0.46%；标准普尔500指数下跌了4.64点，报收1025.11点，跌幅为0.35%。八月份工厂订单下降0.8%，而市场预期为增长。这份经济报告也打击了投资者对经济复苏的信心。由于近期公布的经济数据欠佳，投资者开始质疑美股过去6个月里上涨50%的势头能否延续。美股在过去8个交易日里有7个交易日下跌。道指已从9月23日的高点下降了4.3%。纽约WynstonHillCapital合伙人BruceShalett指出，“就业报告提醒我们虽然形势较一年前有所好转，但问题依然多多。”HaverfordInvestments首席投资官HankSmith则表示，“市场的下跌将继续被看作是买进良机。”道指盘中最低下跌79点，收盘时下跌21点。纽约证交所总成交量从周四的60亿股下降至56亿股，股票涨跌比为1比2。道指本周共下跌1.8%，标准普尔500指数下跌1.8%，纳指下跌2%。道指与标准普尔500指数在三季度均上涨15%。三季度是道指自1998年以来表现最好的一个季度。国债市场有所下跌，10年期国债收益率从周四的3.18%上升至3.22%。美元对其它主要货币汇率涨跌互见，纽约商业交易所交投最活跃的黄金期12月合约上涨3.60美元，收于1004.30美元/盎司，涨幅为0.4%。11月轻质低硫原油期货合约下跌87美分，收于69.95美元，跌幅为1.2%。罗素2000种小盘股指数下跌了3.55点，收报580.20点，跌幅为0.6%。该指数本周总计下跌3.1%。法国CAC-40指数下跌1.90%，收于3,649.90点。德国DAX30指数下跌1.56%，收于5,467.90点。英国富时100指数下跌1.17%，跌破4,988.70点关口，收于4,988.70点。日本日经指数下跌了2.5%。	丹-库克,库克,BruceShalett,HankSmith,罗素	负向	"Close: Dow down 21 points, Nasdaq down 9 points. Due to the government report showing that the number of people who lost their jobs in September exceeded expectations, the US stock market closed lower on Friday. The Labor Department reported that 263,000 jobs were lost in September, more than the 201,000 lost in August, and far more than the 180,000 that economists had expected, and the unemployment rate rose to 9.8%, a new 26-year high. The employment report is usually considered the most important economic report of the month, and a decrease in the number of unemployed people is key to a sustainable economic recovery. Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago, pointed out, ""Investors have assumed in the past two months that the employment market has improved, obviously, this is not the case."" At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.61 points to 9487.67, a decline of 0.23%; the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 9.37 points to 2048.11, a decline of 0.46%; and the S&P 500 fell 4.64 points to 1025.11, a decline of 0.35%. Factory orders fell by 0.8% in August, while market expectations were for growth. This economic report also dampened investors' confidence in the economic recovery. Due to the poor economic data released recently, investors began to question whether the momentum of the S&P 500 rising 50% in the past six months could continue. The US stock market has fallen in 7 out of the last 8 trading days. The Dow has fallen 4.3% from its September 23 high. Bruce Shalett, a partner at Winston Hill Capital in New York, notes that the employment report reminds us that while things have improved from a year ago, there are still many problems. Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Investments, said that the market decline would continue to be seen as a buying opportunity. The Dow fell 79 points during the day and closed down 21 points. The total volume on the NYSE fell from 6 billion shares on Thursday to 5.6 billion shares, with a ratio of 1 to 2 for stocks. The Dow fell 1.8% for the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.8%, and the Nasdaq fell 2%. The Dow and the S&P 500 both rose by 15% in the third quarter. Q3 was the best quarter for the Dow since 1998. The government bond market fell, and the yield of 10-year government bonds rose from 3.18% on Thursday to 3.22%. The dollar traded mixed against other major currencies, and the most actively traded December gold contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $3.60 to $1004.30 per ounce, up 0.4%.

考研辅导：复习进入瓶颈状态该如何突破？案例：小李汉语言文学报考华中科技大学语言学及应用学前段时间的复习比较顺利，感觉成绩提高也非常快。可是这两周以来，复习似乎进入了瓶颈状态。英语阅读没有太大突破，专业课进度也非常缓慢。辛苦一天下来，没有了成就感，人却变得越来越急躁。每天如坐针毡地呆在自习室里，复习资料翻了一遍又一遍，却一个字也看不进去，复习效率越来越低。要是一直这样下去，知识点根本看不完。我开始有些灰心了！当复习进入瓶颈状态时，人往往容易变得急躁、沮丧、灰心。此时重要的不在于突破知识点，而在于调整心态。试着深呼吸一下、在心里告诉自己不要着急、抑或在床头写上诸如“心平气和”一类的字样，相信你的急躁会慢慢远离你，自信会悄悄回到你身边。某教育机构张老师给大家支几招，希望能帮助大家突破瓶颈。1.真诚地接受坏心情的存在虽然我们每个人都希望自己永远拥有好心情，但事实上生活中总会碰到这样那样不顺心的事情，坏心情自然也不可避免。尤其是在复习考研的过程中，背单词、阅读短文、上辅导班、收集专业课资料等等事情多如牛毛，不可能事事顺利。所以，当坏心情存在时，首先要做的就是真诚地接受它的存在。如果我们不能真诚地接受它，因由坏心情的出现而焦躁不安，反而会使我们的心情变得更加糟糕。这样就会进入“心情不好——讨厌心情不好——烦躁——心情更不好”的恶性循环。当我们真诚地接受坏心情的存在时，我们的各种消极情绪反而会悄悄地溜走。这样就会进入“心情不好——接受心情不好——心平气和——心情变得好一些”的良性循环。2.改变看法，改变心情理性情绪疗法的核心观点认为：我们的情绪不是来源于事件本身，而是来源于我们对事件的看法。也许大家都知道一个经典的故事：两个人走在茫茫的沙漠上，他们都有半瓶水。其中一个人很焦急地说“糟糕，只有半瓶水了”，而另一个人却高兴地说“太好了，还有半瓶水”。同样拥有半瓶水，两个人的心情为什么截然不同呢？原来他们看待半瓶水的角度不同，一个人看到了消极的一面，而另一个人看到的是积极的一面。遇到不顺心的事时，换个角度看看这件事情，心情会有所不同的，正所谓“塞翁失马，焉知非福”！今天自我测试虽然成绩不佳，但从测试中找到了自己的问题所在；早上没能够早起背单词，但多睡了一会，精神饱满，更能够提高学习效率。3.积极的自我暗示关注了第29届北京奥运会的同学肯定知道，撑杆跳冠军伊辛巴耶娃在跳前都要蒙在被子里，准备起跑时嘴里还在嘟噜着什么。她为什么要蒙在被子里呢？她在嘟噜什么呢？事实上，伊辛巴耶娃蒙在被子里除了不让照相机干扰自己外，最重要的是在被子里调节自己的情绪，告诉自己“我是最好的”。从心理学的角度来看，这是她在进行积极的自我暗示。也是在北京奥运会上，李佳薇和张怡宁比赛时，我们通过镜头可以看到李佳薇手心里写着一个“稳”字。还有上文提到的郭芙蓉对自己说“世界如此美妙……”，这些其实都是在进行一种积极的自我暗示。在复习考研的过程中，我们也可以通过积极的自我暗示来调节自己的心情。早上洗脸时，对着镜子朝自己微笑；对自己说或在显眼的地方写上一些激励性的话语，如“我很棒”、“保持好心情，提高复习效率”等。这里特别要注意的是，千万不要给自己消极的自我暗示。不要总对自己说“我很糟糕”、“今天真的很倒霉”等话语。如果你总是对自己进行消极的自我暗示，你会发现你真的就会变得很糟糕、很倒霉。就如小品《卖拐》中，赵本山的几句“拐了拐了”就真的让范伟拐了一样。此外，同学们不妨试着调整复习思路，毕竟适合自己的复习方法才是最好的。很多同学们不了解自己的看书习惯或者阅读习惯，所以参考别人的复习方案，或者单纯图块，就为自己制定了一个名副其实的考研计划。其效果如何，可想而知。	小李,张老师,伊辛巴耶娃,李佳薇,张怡宁,郭芙蓉,赵本山,范伟	正向	"Postgraduate Entrance Examination tutoring: How to break through when review enters a bottleneck state? Case: Xiao Li, who majored in Chinese Language and Literature, applied to the School of Chinese Language and Applied Linguistics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. His review in the recent period was quite smooth, and he felt that his scores were improving very quickly. But in the past two weeks, it seems that review has entered a bottleneck state. There is no significant breakthrough in English reading, and the progress of professional courses is also very slow. After a tiring day, without a sense of achievement, people become more and more irritable. Every day, I sit in the self-study room like I'm on pins and needles, reviewing the materials over and over, but I can't concentrate on a single word, and my review efficiency is getting lower and lower. If it goes on like this, we will never finish the knowledge points. I began to lose heart! When review enters a bottleneck state, people are often prone to becoming irritable, depressed, and discouraged. What is important now is not to break through the knowledge points, but to adjust the mentality. Try to take a deep breath, tell yourself not to be in a hurry in your heart, or write something like ""calm down"" on the bedside, and believe that your impatience will gradually leave you, and confidence will quietly return to you. Teacher Zhang from a certain educational institution gave a few tips, hoping to help everyone break through the bottleneck. 1. Accept the existence of bad moods sincerely Although we all hope to have good moods forever, in fact, we will inevitably encounter things that are not smooth in life, and bad moods are also inevitable. Especially during the review process for the postgraduate entrance examination, there are so many things to do, such as memorizing words, reading short articles, attending tutoring classes, collecting materials for specialized courses, etc., which are countless, and it is impossible to be smooth in everything. So, when you are in a bad mood, the first thing to do is to sincerely accept its existence. If we cannot accept it sincerely, and become anxious because of the appearance of bad mood, it will make our mood even worse. This will enter a vicious cycle of ""being in a bad mood—disliking being in a bad mood—irritability—being in an even worse mood."" When we sincerely accept the existence of bad moods, our various negative emotions will quietly slip away. This will enter a良性循环良性循环 of ""bad mood - accept bad mood - calm down - mood improves a little"". 2. Change of view, change of mood. The core view of Rational Emotive Therapy holds that our emotions are not caused by the events themselves, but by our views on the events. Perhaps everyone knows a classic story: two people walking in the vast desert, they both have half a bottle of water. One of them said anxiously, ""Oh no, only half a bottle of water left,"" while the other was happy and said, ""Great, there's still half a bottle of water."" Why are the moods of the two people who have half a bottle of water completely different? Originally, they viewed the half-empty glass differently, one saw the negative side, while the other saw the positive side. When you encounter something that is not going well, try to look at the matter from a different angle, and your mood will be different, as the saying goes, ""Misfortune may be an actual blessing in disguise."" Today's self-test, although not satisfactory, found the problems in my own test; I did not get up early to memorize words in the morning, but I slept a little longer, and I was more energetic, which could improve learning efficiency. 3. Positive self-suggestion The students who paid attention to the 29th Beijing Olympic Games must know that Yshimbayeva, the pole vault champion, had to be covered in a blanket before jumping, and was mumbling something in her mouth when she was ready to start running. Why did she cover herself with the quilt? What is she mumbling? In fact, Yelena Isinbayeva covered her head not only to prevent the camera from interfering with her, but also to regulate her own emotions in the blanket, telling herself ""I am the best."" From a psychological perspective, this is her engaging in positive self-suggestion. It was also at the Beijing Olympics that we could see Li Jiawei writing a “steady” character on the palm of her hand when she was competing against Zhang Yining. And the Guo Fengrong saying to herself ""The world is so wonderful…"" in the previous paragraph is actually a kind of positive self-suggestion. During the review of the postgraduate entrance examination, we can also regulate our mood through positive self-suggestion. In the morning, smile at yourself in the mirror when washing your face; say some encouraging words to yourself or write them in a prominent place, such as ""I'm great"" and ""Maintain a good mood and improve your review efficiency"". It is especially important to avoid negative self-suggestion. Do not always say to yourself that you are ""very bad"" and ""very unlucky"" today. If you always give yourself negative self-suggestions, you will find that you really will become very bad and very unlucky. Just as in the sketch ""Selling Cane"", Zhao Benshan's few ""cane, cane"" really made Fan Wei cane. In addition, students can also try to adjust their review思路, after all, the review method that suits you is the best. Many students do not understand their own reading habits or reading habits, so they refer to other people's review plans or simply copy to formulate a name that is actually a postgraduate entrance examination plan for themselves. Its effect, can be imagined."

From ""online advertising"" to ""interactive marketing"", and then to ""cross-media integrated marketing"", the Internet reflects the competitive rules of the market: innovators need to have sufficient vitality and demonstrate real value, such as advertising and marketing, which may rewrite the rules. In fact, in 2009, the revision of this rule was more significant. The Cross-media Integrated Marketing Awards have moved beyond the selection of interactive online advertising and entered the scope of media marketing innovation selection. After years of innovation, the Internet new media has rewritten the definition of ""media"" in China, restructured the pattern of media competition and cooperation, and the future market will belong to ""cross-media integration planning and marketing"". Change two: ""Marketing Innovation"" originates from media and technological innovation, which we have been talking about. Where does its power come from? Continuous innovation from the media, including the birth of new media, is inseparable from the progress of technology. Focus on the media. Focus on creativity. It is reported that Adworld Interactive Marketing World is an annual hallmark annual grand ceremony in the field of interactive marketing and online advertising in China. It has been successfully held for six consecutive years, and it is the most authoritative and core cooperation and exchange platform in this field in China. As an annual market wind vane, it is highly valued and widely and deeply participated by advertisers, agencies, media and other upstream and downstream parties.

男子在火车上强占他人座位收取让座费新快报讯（记者李国辉通讯员李文源）因在广州找工作碰壁，两名河北籍男子郭某、邵某为发财，竟在列车上强占他人座位收取让位费，结果被乘警逮个正着，分别受到了行政拘留、罚款的处罚。16日清早6时许，L308次列车自广州火车站开车后不久，一名旅客匆匆赶到乘警值班室举报称，有人霸占了他的座位还要强行收取让座费。乘警立即赶到事发车厢抓获了两名嫌疑男子，当场收缴非法所得款130元。据查，嫌疑人郭某和邵某均30岁左右，本月初他们从河北老家来广州打工，但因为没有技术又不愿吃苦，所以找了近半个月工作都没着落。想到国庆节临近，南来北往的旅客开始增多，他们便想了个霸占火车座位卖座位赚钱的法子。16日，两人买了短途火车票上车，抢在其他旅客前霸占了他人的座位，然后以30元至40元不等的价格向旅客收取“让座费”。两人在短短10分钟内即向旅客收取“让座费”130元，但随后就被乘警抓住。因其行为严重扰乱了公共场所秩序，侵害了旅客权益，韶关车站派出所对两人分别做出行政拘留10日和罚款500元的处罚。	李国辉,李文源,郭某,邵某	负向	"A man forcibly occupied others' seats on the train and charged a seat change fee, and the new快报 (Reporter Li Guohui, Li Wenyuan, a reporter from the Liwenyuan) Two Hebei men, Guo Mou and Shao Mou, who failed to find a job in Guangzhou, attempted to make money by forcibly occupying others' seats on the train and charging a seat change fee, and were caught by the train police, and were punished with administrative detention and fines respectively. At 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the 16th, a passenger rushed to the duty room of the train police after the L308 train left Guangzhou station, and reported that someone had occupied his seat and was forcibly charging a seat-letting fee. The train police immediately rushed to the carriage where the incident occurred and apprehended two suspects, confiscating 130 yuan in illegal proceeds on the spot. It was found that Guo and Shao, the suspects, were both in their early thirties. At the beginning of this month, they came to Guangzhou to work from their hometown in Hebei, but because they had no skills and were unwilling to work hard, they had not found a job after searching for nearly half a month. Thinking of the approaching National Day holiday, the number of travelers traveling north and south increased, and they came up with a way to occupy train seats and sell seats to make money. On the 16th, the two people bought short-distance train tickets and occupied others' seats in advance. Then they charged passengers a ""seat-letting fee"" of 30-40 yuan. The two collected a ""seat fee"" of 130 yuan from the passengers in just 10 minutes, but were then caught by the train police. Due to their serious disruption of public order and infringement of the rights of passengers, the Shaoguan railway station police station imposed an administrative detention of 10 days and a fine of 500 yuan on the two people respectively."
