      "['', '正向', \"The upward trend is on schedule, with 3180 as the first goal for the end of the year. Huaxun Financial will welcome a red start in November. Presenting a pattern of increased volume and overall gains in individual stocks. Affected by the sharp decline of the US dollar, the two markets opened high and quickly advanced to the 3000-point level, successfully recovering the 10-day and 5-day moving averages. From the chart, the Growth Enterprise Market was not affected by the first batch of 1.2 billion shares being unlocked, but instead, it rose sharply, which undoubtedly boosted market sentiment. Permanent magnet, gold, multicrystalline silicon, low carbon and other concepts surged, and the strong pull of non-ferrous metals and coal sectors has also attracted a large amount of funds from outside the market. Meanwhile, the Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and other regional plates also showed much stronger performance than the market. Affected by the further tightening of regulated policies, real estate is again at the forefront of the decline, while the performance of sectors such as chemical fiber, tourism, power, cement, and media is also somewhat worse. At the end of the day, the stock index consolidated around the 3050 level and successfully broke through. At the close, 90% of the stocks on the two markets rose, and the Shanghai Composite Index closed at 3054.05 points, up 2.52%. There were 66 stocks with a limit up, and no non-ST stocks with a limit down. The volume was 253.9 billion, which was significantly higher than the previous trading day. The PMI data released today met market expectations and showed a significant increase compared to last month. This indicates that domestic manufacturing has performed well despite the adverse conditions of energy conservation and emission reduction, slowing real estate investment, and poor recovery of the external economy, and of course, it has maintained market confidence. The coal sector can still play the leading role during the consolidation phase of crude oil prices, and this is also due to the strong expectation of rising resource prices in the future. Of course, the losses of power enterprises cannot reverse the coal enterprises' willingness to reduce prices, which is also an important reason for the continued explosive growth of the sector. As for the steel sector, although Baogang and Guanggang, which have strong daily limit-up, attract attention, they still cannot lead the three leading varieties in the sector to a strong rebound. The fundamental reason is that the industry has entered the season of weak demand, and the space for performance improvement is not very large. As for India’s appeal to ban the export of iron ore from the country, it has to some extent increased the pressure on the import of Indian ore in the domestic market, but the global iron ore market remains sluggish for the time being. The greatest difficulty in the industry lies in the weak demand at the downstream. Huaxun Investment believes that the short-term bulls have taken the initiative in the market and there is still momentum for further upward attack in the later period. The index stopped falling and stabilized around 2950 points, and once again stood above the 5-day line, announcing the end of the continuous adjustment that lasted for several days. In the later period, the major market will further consolidate the upper limit of the box and prepare for the next counterattack. Graphically, the 3160-3180 range remains the strongest resistance level above, while the 2890-2900 area around the annual line provides strong support. From the daily MACD, the volume surge and the advance avoided the top dead cross, while from the weekly MACD, DIF has already crossed above the 0 axis and the red candle continues to grow longer. The factors affecting the operation of the stock index this week are from the outside. This week, the latest interest rate policies of the Fed, the ECB, and other developed countries have attracted the attention of the market, and the specific amount and implementation plan of the Fed's quantitative easing policy also determine the total amount of global liquidity in the future. The recent trend of the RMB appreciation and the continuous rise in the price of primary commodities will not change, and the extent of the appreciation will affect the height of the rebound of the stock index. In terms of operations, investors can actively pay attention to strong varieties that are rising along the 5-day line and participate appropriately. Focus on the sectors benefiting from the appreciation of the RMB, anti-inflation varieties, and the restructured individual stocks led by the military industry, as well as the second-tier blue-chip varieties with a strong demand for strong rebound.

According to the Israeli media on the 28th, the Israeli military launched a large-scale air strike on the Gaza Strip on the 27th, resulting in hundreds of casualties, and Hamas\\' office buildings and multiple camps were also severely damaged. Hamas armed forces issued a statement on the night of the 27th, vowing to launch a \"third uprising\" to thoroughly defeat the Israeli regime. In a statement released by Hamas armed forces on the evening of the 27th, it said that Israel launched a military operation similar to a terrorist attack against the civilian targets of Palestine, which has already caused hundreds of innocent civilians to be injured and killed, and Hamas will retaliate against Israel with \"hellish\" revenge and continue to launch rockets into Israeli territory. The statement also threatened that war had begun, and the time for Hamas to launch a \"third intifada\" had arrived, with Hamas\\' armed forces vowing to deliver the \"most lethal blow to the enemy of the returnees\" and to completely defeat the Israeli regime, but this uprising would be \"peaceful\" for the Palestinian people. Hamas also called on all Palestinians to unite and launch suicide attacks against Israeli targets and soldiers to make the Israeli regime “clearly feel our resistance determination.” On the 27th, Hamas armed organization spokesman Barhoom also called on its subordinate armed factions to launch long-range rocket attacks on Israel in retaliation for the Israeli army\\'s air strike on Gaza. Barhumi said that the Israeli air strike on Gaza was a crime against all Palestinians, and the organization has asked its subordinate armed factions, the Kata\\'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, to launch longer-range rockets. In addition, many other Palestinian armed factions in Gaza believed that the IDF\\'s attack on that day was a \"public declaration of war\" and that they were ready to launch a series of attacks on Israel. Within two hours of the Israeli air strike on Gaza, Hamas militants in Gaza fired more than 30 rockets and mortar shells at the southern Negev region of Israel. One rocket hit a civilian house in the town of Nittawat, killing one resident and injuring three others. Casun旅已宣布对此次火箭弹袭击事件负责。 In response to this air strike operation, the Israeli military issued a statement on the same day, saying that Israel\\'s air strike on Gaza was to retaliate for Hamas\\' continuous rocket attacks on Israeli territory, and the Israeli military\\'s attack targets were Hamas institutions. The Israeli army will continue to take action against Hamas until the armed personnel in Gaza stop attacking Israel. President Peres, in an interview with the media, said that Israel would take all necessary measures to stop Hamas and other armed organizations from attacking Israel, but Israel does not plan to occupy the Gaza Strip again. Abu Ruaidah, Abbas\\' spokesman, issued a statement in Ramallah, a city in the West Bank, Jordan, on the same day, saying, \"Abbas strongly condemns the Israeli attack on Gaza, and calls on the Israeli government to immediately stop the attack on Gaza and calls on the international community to intervene.\" A ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and various armed factions in Gaza, led by Hamas, in June this year. After the cease-fire agreement expired on December 19, Hamas fired about a hundred rockets and mortars into Israeli territory, without causing any Israeli casualties. Israel had previously threatened to retaliate, but the Israeli media reported on the 26th that the IDF\\'s actions would be limited and would not launch a large-scale attack. (Xiao Xi)']\n"

      "['周晋竹,艾博年,汪同三,李慧勇,李刚', '正向', \"Economists predict: the trend of commodity prices rising in 2011 is obvious. China Radio International, Beijing, February 19 (Reporter Zhou Jinju) According to the economic voice report, at the 2011 China Macroeconomic Forecast Spring Conference held today (19), many economists predict that commodity prices will have an upward trend this year, and the upward pressure on agricultural products and energy prices is particularly obvious. Due to the fundamental role of commodities at the industrial level and their use as financial instruments to hedge price risks in the capital market, the price trends of commodities have attracted much attention. Rio Tinto CEO Ajborn believes that the spot price of iron ore has approached the historical high of $200 per ton, which was unforeseeable a year ago, but due to the fact that no large new mines have been put into production in the past two years, the supply and demand contradiction is still tight. Wang Tongshu, the director of the Institute of Quantitative Economics and Technical Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, made a forecast that the commodities would be on the rise this year. Wang Tongshan: The prices of primary commodities are definitely on the rise, not decided by us, but by the international market. Now the world economy is in a slow recovery process, which will inevitably increase the demand for primary commodities and cause the prices of primary commodities to rise. Another factor is that the US is implementing QE2, whose policy target is to raise prices, leading to an increase in the international commodity prices denominated in US dollars. Commodity prices on the international market will inevitably lead to a rise in these prices in our country. Li Huiyong, the chief macro analyst of Shenwan Hongyuan Securities Research Institute, pointed out in more detail that the upward trend of agricultural products and crude oil prices was obvious this year: Li Huiyong: The structure of commodities in 2011 is clearly divided, and I personally have a good outlook on agricultural products and crude oil. Li Gang, the head of the Agricultural Bank of China’s financial market research, also expressed concern about the future rise in agricultural product prices. In addition, he explained the reasons for the rise in commodity prices from two aspects: Li Gang: I think commodities are very special goods. The supply elasticity is less than the demand elasticity, and the supply will not increase in the short term, but the demand is very large. Second, it largely depends on the fact that it is priced in US dollars. Although the US economy was recovering in the first half of 2011, the US dollar was generally weak, which had a slight stimulating effect. However, Li Gang also pointed out that not all the factors affecting the fluctuations in the prices of primary commodities were upward pressures, and there were also weakening factors, such as China's policy tightening: Li Gang: The policy tightening at the end of last year was the biggest drop in the futures market at that time. Given the current situation, it is likely that either an interest rate hike or a reserve requirement ratio increase this year will reduce the world’s commodity prices.\"]\n"

      "['徐金波,简宜彬', '正向', 'Shenzhen Foxconn Launches Talent War in Wuhan This Year, with More Than 50,000 Employees. Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 27 (Reporter Xu Jinfu) As the Spring Festival of the Year of the Rabbit is approaching, a peak of migrant workers returning to Wuhan, Hubei Province, was observed on January 27. Foxconn, which has relocated some of its business to the Wuhan park, launched a \"talent war\" to recruit more than 30,000 ordinary workers with relatively generous salaries after the Spring Festival to meet the demand for production labor. On that day, Hubei migrant workers returning to their hometowns from all over China poured out of the Wuhan, Wuchang and Hankou railway stations, and then turned to nearby highway passenger stations such as Hongji, Fuganjiao and Xinrongcun. At the entrances of these large transportation hubs, recruitment advertisements for Wuhan Foxconn attracted a large number of migrant workers returning home to inquire and fill out forms. It is understood that the new positions added to the Foxconn Wuhan park are mainly grassroots production workers (general workers), and anyone who is at least 16 years old and has a junior high school education or equivalent can apply. New employees can earn a monthly income of 2200 yuan during the probationary and assessment period, and the maximum after the assessment period is 2800 yuan. Among them, students of CNC, electronics, and mechanical vocational high schools are the most popular. Chen Yibin, vice president of Foxconn Technology Group, said that the first phase of the Wuhan Industrial Park, which invested 1 billion US dollars in April 2007, has now been completed and put into production, with more than 20,000 workers in the park. With Foxconn accelerating its internal relocation and the gradual improvement of the park\\'s supporting facilities, Foxconn will gradually move its desktop computer production lines from Shenzhen and Yantai to Wuhan in the near future. In 3 to 5 years, the annual production of desktop computers in the Foxconn Wuhan Park will reach more than 68 million units, accounting for about half of the global annual production of desktop computers. In addition, some game console production lines will also be transferred to Wuhan. In April to June this year, three new production lines were put into operation in the Foxconn Wuhan Industrial Park, and more than 30,000 ordinary workers were urgently needed. At that time, the number of employees in the park will exceed 50,000. (End)']\n"

Microsoft's appetite is really big, not only to venture into the handheld game field, but also interested in mobile phones, and this time it has a heavyweight partner - NVIDIA. Integrating NVIDIA's powerful graphics card technology with Microsoft's WM platform, such a mobile phone is indeed worth looking forward to. Microsoft is for the old hands, and it is careful about every step, and will not take risks, which is easy to be sluggish. At the beginning of this year, it was rumored that Microsoft would intervene in the research and development of game phones, which can be understood, X360's performance is comparable to PSP. Then there was news that Microsoft was likely to release a ZunePhone in the near future. Until the latest news, Microsoft's product in cooperation with NVIDIA will be released at the 3GSM conference in February next year, further confirming the previous rumors. But to make a fortune like Apple, it seems that all manufacturers, including Microsoft, have a hard time. However, now that they have joined forces with NVIDIA, the display hardware of mobile products will certainly take a leap, and adding more entertainment operations will certainly make this product stand out.

      "['边强,亚历山大,郭指导,接军,奥尼尔,郭士强', '正向', 'The captain of Liaoning commented on the fire-fighting foreign aid, who is not strong but gives the players on the outside confidence. Bianqiang, who once played with Alexander, is excited about the return of this \"old friend\", not only because Alexander and he have a good private relationship, but also because Alexander now shows a stronger strength than before. As the team captain, Bian Qiang, on behalf of the team members of Liaoning, shouted out their confidence: \"The team once went through a difficult period, but with the arrival of two foreign players, we still have confidence to enter the playoffs.\" The body is obviously a size larger. After several years, when I met my old friend Alexander again, the captain of the Liaoning team, Bian Qiang, was very happy. \"I remember that he played for the Liaoning team in the CBA 2003-04 season. At that time, I was still a young player in the team. At that time, Coach Guo and Coach Jie Jun were still playing. However, at that time, my relationship with Alexander was very good, and we often joked around. Now that he is back, we are all very happy. Alexander\\'s first impression of Jianqiang was that his body was much stronger than before. I remember that he was thinner and more frail at the time, so he was at a disadvantage in the battle of the boards. This time, when he returned to the Liaoning team, when he took off his coat during the training on that day, it was obviously one size larger than before. I think his strength must have increased a lot, which is very helpful to us who lack the ability to compete in the front court. Jianqiang seemed a little excited. Jianqiang\\'s hunch was soon confirmed. In the subsequent match between Liaoning and Tianjin, Alexander\\'s performance in the paint was recognized by the entire team. When it comes to Alexander\\'s defense, Bianqiang said, \"He played well in this game, and he gave us a lot of help in defending the foreign players and protecting the backcourt rebounds. He has also made great progress in terms of withstanding the inner-line confrontation, and his level is much higher than before.\" Free throws are the Achilles\\' heel of most centers, and the same was true of Alexander before. And what made Bian Qiang so happy was that Alexander\\'s free throw level had also improved significantly recently. \"Now he is much more accurate at free throws than before. You haven\\'t seen his free throws before, they were as bad as Shaq\\'s. But through the training of the past two days, I feel that he is much better than before.\" The outside players have more confidence. The players of Liaoning team all think that Alexander\\'s performance in defense is very good. But defense is only one aspect of the help that Alexander brings to the team. As a center player, he even gave 5 assists and 2 steals in the game against Tianjin team. Regarding his performance, Bian Qiang said, \"His passing ability is very good. Now when we break through, he can find a good position to shoot and score. When he is double-teamed in the post, he can also see the open space for us to create shooting opportunities for the outside.\" Although Guo Shiqiang, who is always cautious, thinks that Alexander’s strength still needs to be further tested in the game, but as a player, Bian Qiang has a direct feeling of the changes brought by Alexander. \"The most obvious is that now that he stands in the frontcourt, our players on the periphery are more decisive when shooting, because of the guarantee of rebounds, so we are more confident.\" In Biaoxiang\\'s view, Alexander\\'s current condition has not been adjusted to the best, and he can play much better. I believe he will play better, because he is still adjusting to the time difference now, and in the next match, he will definitely bring us more surprises. Jianqiang said.']\n"

      "['高帅,朱辉,韩冬梅,杨月山,胡秉臣,马长森,杨有,王殿学,田颖', '负向', 'The case of the gymnastics prodigy suing the gymnastics school for abuse was reopened in the Xuanwu Court yesterday afternoon, with six relevant personnel from the Xiannanguan gymnastics school appearing in court to testify on behalf of the Xiannanguan gymnastics school. The testimony of the witness triggered four major contradictions. The gymnastics team leader who used to be in charge said that he said this about Coach Zhu Hui, who is tall and handsome, because he had a conflict with the gymnastics team leader at that time, and that it was not the truth. Gao Shuai has won multiple national gymnastics championships in the child and youth categories, and was selected to join the Xian Nong Tan Gymnastics School in 2006. Gao Shuai left school on April 29 and then stayed in a mental hospital. Gao Shuai sued Xian农Tan Sports School for 150,000 yuan in compensation (reported in our newspaper on November 8 and December 8). Gao Shuai did not appear in court yesterday. His mother, Han Dongmei, sat alone in the plaintiff\\'s seat. She moved the TV and DVD from her home to the plaintiff\\'s seat and prepared to play 3 DVDs and 6 VCDs as evidence of video and audio recordings. She said that Gao Shuai\\'s mental depression had worsened, and he was a little irritable. She was worried that he would be stimulated by watching the video. According to the evidence of Han Dongmei and Xiannongtan Sports School, the parties mainly argued over whether Gao Shuai was beaten at Xiannongtan Sports School and whether he had received normal training. Han Dongmei showed the recording of Zhu Hui saying that \"Yang Yueshan did not allow Gaoshuai to be taught by him\". Zhu Hui admitted that he had said so, but said that it was because he had a conflict with Yang Yueshan, and that \"it was not the truth.\" The case was not pronounced in court. Focus 1 Gao Shuai was physically punished? In the previous trial, Han Dongmei said that Gao Shuai was often beaten and physically punished at the Xian农tan Sports School, and that there were over 60 ways in which senior players beat him. Yesterday, they debated on this issue. 【Gao\\'s mother】Someone trained Gao Shuai to kneel. [Yang Yueshan] This is practicing pressing the foot surface. Han Dongmei played a video in court. The first coach of Xian农tan Sports School, Yang Yueshan, was guiding a child to train. Gao Shuai was kneeling beside him to watch. After the child stopped training, Gao Shuai helped move the equipment. Han Dongmei said that making Gao Shuai kneel is inhuman abuse, not only not giving training, but also making him carry things. Yang Yueshan said that Gao Shuai was kneeling to practice pressing the sole of his foot, and other children also had such actions, and it was not abuse. The lawyer from the Xian农an Tan Sports School said that one CD could not prove the case and asked Han Dongmei to provide the video recordings for the whole year. You should provide the video of the whole year! Han Dongmei shouted at him. After the meeting, Gaoshuai said on the phone that in the video, Yang Yueshan made him kneel. He said that the action of pressing the sole of the foot was to have the knees and the toes on the ground, and the upper body lying back as far as possible, while he was simply kneeling. 【Gao\\'s mother】The big team has over 60 ways to beat people.【Yang Yueshan】It was just children playing around. Han Dongmei said that after Gao Shuai was bullied many times, the school held a parent meeting, at which time the gymnastics team leader Yang Yueshan and Hu Bingchen both participated. The school also required the children who hit others to write a letter of repentance, and there were more than 60 ways to hit others in the letters the children wrote. At the meeting, Yang Yueshan showed the other parents a piece of paper with dozens of methods of beating children, but not Han Dongmei. Yang Yueshan denied the existence of the note, saying that children playing around, it was just a kick, borrowing one dollar, and there were no dozens of ways to beat people. Subsequently, Hu Bingchen testified in court that the note existed, but could not be found now. Focus 2 is tall and handsome but not trained? In his complaint, Gao Shuai said that he had never been trained at the Xiannongtan Sports School, and that the coach did not teach him a single move. The training schedule of three coaches from the Xian农an Tan Sports School was submitted to the court, which stated that Gao Shuai had received normal training. 【Coach\\'s Mother】The coach\\'s plan was \"blank\" for four months.【School Lawyer】This was a mistake by Coach Yang Yueshan, the first coach of Gao Shuai, who strictly followed the training plan to train Gao Shuai. Last July, he handed Gao Shuai over to Coach Ma Changsen, who then trained Gao Shuai under Coach Zhu Hui. Han Dongmei denies that Gao Shuai was taught by Ma Changsen. She said that the coach plan of the Xianongtan Sports School was blank from July to October last year, and the coach plan of Coach Changshen Ma was signed from July to October this year. At this time, Gao Shuai was receiving treatment at the An Ding Hospital. It is Coach Ma Changsen\\'s matter. \"Yang Yu Shan said.\" The lawyer from the Xian农an Temple Sports School explained that this was a typographical error by Coach Ma Changshen. [Ni Gao\\'s mother] Zhu Hui once said that \"leadership required not to teach Gao Shuai.\" [Zhu Hui] This is not the case. Zhu Hui, another coach of Gao Shuai, testified in court that when he took over the training of Gao Shuai, Gao Shuai\\'s level was higher than when he entered the Xian农tan Sports School. Han Dongmei immediately released the recording. In the recording, Zhu Hui said that Gao Shuai’s level at that time was not up to the time when he entered the Shennongtang, and that some basic movements Gao Shuai could no longer do. He also said that it was the coach’s problem and the school’s responsibility. In the recording, Zhu Hui said that Yang Yueshan told him not to teach Gaoshuai, but to teach another child. The judge asked Zhu Hui to explain, who said that he had indeed said these words, but they were just his words, not the truth. He said that Yang Yueshan was his boss at the time, but he had differences with Yang in specialized teaching and technical understanding, and he believed that there was a problem with Yang Yueshan\\'s teaching. He said that he had a personal opinion of Yang, and that at the time, he believed that he had received some unfair treatment in the gymnastics team, so he said so. This group of manuscripts were written by reporters Wang Dianxue and Tian Ying of our newspaper. What made the 12-year-old champion write a suicide note? A rare tragedy, who is lying?

The theme of the 2009 Grassroots Conference was \"Seeking Up and Down\", which borrowed from Qu Yuan\\'s famous work, \"Li Sao\", \"The road is long and arduous, I will seek up and down.\" The road ahead is long, and unremitting pursuit and exploration are the true reflection and secret to the success of small and medium-sized websites. How to turn traffic into profit and how to achieve sustainable development are challenges faced by small and medium-sized websites. As the financial crisis spreads, the future of small and medium-sized websites has also become a hot topic of discussion. The grand scene of a thousand people attending is not often seen in industry conferences in the Internet industry in China, which can be seen from the scale of the small and medium-sized website group and the grassroots webmasters\\' expectations for the development of the Internet in 2009. The conference invited many successful Internet companies and famous individual website owners, with entrepreneurship and innovation as the main thread, focusing on the entrepreneurial opportunities for small and medium-sized websites, the development trends of the Internet in 2009, and other hot topics such as how small and medium-sized websites can survive and develop in the economic cold winter, and had in-depth exchanges with grassroots website owners. Founder of the Shanghai Station Master Association, Yu Jiaxin, said that the Shanghai Station Master Association is an open, civilian social organization. After integrating the concept of the cultural festival, it aims to hold an Internet conference that guides small and medium-sized websites to write history. The carefully crafted \"one festival and one conference\" provides a good platform for communication and discussion of the challenges and opportunities faced by entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized websites, and also creates an opportunity for a wide range of Internet colleagues to broaden their horizons, obtain information, make friends widely, and share resources.']\n"

ICBC Guangda clearly announced that the handling fees for the \"Intra-bank Transfer\" and \"Inter-bank Transfer\" items in the personal online banking transfer and remittance function would be discounted to 30%, and the handling fees for intra-bank异地transfer and inter-bank remittance would be reduced from 0.5% to 0.15% after the discount, and the upper limit of the handling fees would be correspondingly reduced. The China Huaxia Bank also launched discounts ranging from 3 to 8, which covered both personal and corporate online banking, and almost all the functions of the bank\\'s online banking for transfers and remittances. The promotion will be in effect from April 8th. It is understood that the current charging items of personal online banking of banks are mainly transfer and remittance functions, and other functions will not be charged extra fees through online banking, except for the charges of the business itself. Most banks do not charge annual fees for online banking at present. As online banking business is becoming more and more important, many banks have lowered the online transfer fee. A vice general manager of the electronic banking department of a bank in Shenzhen believes that it is a move by latecomers to expand the market scale through preferential activities. Banks in the promotion stage of online banking can attract more customers to use their online banking through such activities. And the low cost of online banking and its important supplement to physical branches is one of the reasons why some banks, especially shareholding banks, are actively promoting online banking. It is reported that for the same business, customers can handle it through online banking, and the corresponding cost for the bank is 1/6-1/7 of that at the counter. As electronic banking functions are gradually improved, electronic banking services including online banking have been accepted by more and more people. Take ICBC (601398) as an example, ICBC\\'s electronic banking transaction volume in the first quarter reached 32 trillion yuan, accounting for 44.5% of the bank\\'s total business volume, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from the beginning of the year. Online banking service fees vary greatly. It is understood that even for the same online banking transaction, the charging standards of various banks are also quite different. For example, the handling fee for intra-bank异地transfer and inter-bank remittance of China Merchants Bank was only 0.5% before the adjustment, and it is now reduced to 0.15%. ICBC’s intra-bank and inter-bank transfer fee is 0.9%, which is 1.8 times the original of CEB before the adjustment and 6 times the adjusted one. In addition, the charging standards of various banks for online banking transfer and remittance business are different. For example, some banks have the same handling fee rate for three types of business, such as intra-bank intercity remittance, inter-bank intercity remittance, and intra-city inter-bank remittance, such as ICBC and Everbright Bank. There are also more detailed charging standards for various bank functions, such as the professional version of the online banking of China Merchants Bank (60036): 2 yuan for intra-city inter-bank remittance per transaction; 0.2% of the remittance amount for intra-city same-bank remittance, and 1% for remittance to corporate accounts; 1% of the remittance amount for inter-city inter-bank remittance.']\n"

Every Journalist Hu Yuhui China Unicom (600050, closing price 5.33 yuan) 3G user data in June returned to a high level. The data shows that the net increase of China Unicom\\'s 3G users in June reached 1.855 million, ending the previous two months of consecutive month-to-month decline and returning to the highest single-month point set in March this year. So far, China Unicom\\'s operating performance for the first half of this year is clear. During the period, the company added 9.885 million 3G users, with an average monthly increase of 1.6475 million; the total number of 3G users reached 23.945 million, and the penetration rate of its total 181 million mobile phone users increased to 13.2%. The improvement in June user data was due to the company\\'s shift in marketing focus, with the launch of a thousand-yuan smart phone for sale last month. Recently, Lu Yimin, the general manager of China Unicom, said that they would continue to promote the thousand-yuan smart phones. However, industry insiders pointed out that China Unicom set a development target of adding 25 million 3G users this year at the beginning of the year. Now that 2011 is halfway through, only 40% of the first half has been completed. To achieve the预定用户增长目标in the next 6 months, the average monthly addition of 3G users needs to be expanded to 2.52 million. At the annual shareholders\\' meeting held on May 24 this year, the China Unicom chairman, Chang Xiaobing, clearly stated that \"the company is confident to achieve the goal of adding 25 million 3G users this year, and it may even exceed this goal.\" The marketing strategy of China Unicom\\'s new RMB 1000 smart phone is very attractive to low and middle-end users. The 100,000 ZTE V880s that China Unicom announced to fully underwrite had a daily sales peak of nearly 10,000 units, with an average daily sales of nearly 5,000 units in June. Calculated by this, this model alone attracted 150,000 new users to the company. Guang Juntao, a researcher from China International Securities, said that with more thousand-yuan-level intelligent terminals launched in July, it will bring positive promotion to user growth.']\n"

If there is a bathtub at home, it can be done easily. Have a chest massage in the bathtub and experience the feeling of getting a chest massage in water. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Fill the bathtub with water and ensure that the water level is just above the body. Control the water temperature to about 40 degrees, not too hot, just a little higher than body temperature is fine. Lie in the bathtub and clean your whole body with a loofah until you feel warm all over. 3. Massage your breasts by hand for about 5 minutes. 4. Use a soft brush to brush the breasts from the inner side to the outer side in an arc. 5. Turn on the tap and brush while rinsing the breasts. 6. After getting out of the bath, sit on the edge of the bathtub, apply moisturizing cream, and gently massage your breasts in a clockwise direction for about 10 minutes with both hands. 7. Alternate between cold and hot towels to wipe the breasts and perform cold and hot stimulation, changing every 5 minutes. 8. If the breasts are a little drooping, you can use the showerhead to rinse from below the breasts upwards and massage the breasts at the same time. It should be noted that breast shower massage should be done before going to bed or after getting up in the morning when taking a shower. Do not use essential oils or other irritant drugs during massage, ordinary shower gel or soap liquid is enough. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before the massage, and if your nails are too long, cut them short to avoid hurting the nipple or skin. Of course, it is not only by using a bathtub that you can do breast massage, you can also do the above actions in the shower, and from some aspects, it is more beneficial to the development of the breasts than a bathtub. If you use the showerhead to alternate between hot and cold water from bottom to top to stimulate the breasts when taking a shower, it is very beneficial for the fullness and firmness of the breasts. Due to the short-term low-temperature stimulation, it can effectively improve the mechanical structure of mammary tissue, increase its tension, and thus promote growth and development. After washing, apply a moisturizing cream while your body is still slightly warm, and do a breast massage, which will be more beneficial for the development of the breasts, and also for the shower water to massage the breasts. Not only can it make the breasts more beautiful, but it can also make the color of the areola and the shape of the breasts more beautiful.']\n"

      "['高丽霞', '正向', \"The funds have been lying in wait for the performance of 216 companies with a huge increase in the first half of the year. Journalist, Gao Lixia, the mid-year report of 2011 will be launched this week. Statistics show that there are fewer good news and more bad news in the mid-year performance forecasts this year. Attractive mid-year earnings have stirred up the market, becoming the main driving force for the upward trend in the market in recent days. Journalists have found that among the listed companies that have disclosed their earnings forecasts, 216 companies have doubled their performance, and 146 of them were heavily invested in early this quarter. More than 60% of companies have doubled their earnings. According to Wind statistics, as of yesterday, a total of 905 listed companies have released their earnings forecasts for this year's mid-term, among which there are as many as 714 stocks with increased earnings, accounting for nearly 80%, and there are also as many as 216 stocks with earnings doubling. Of the 216 stocks with significantly increased interim earnings, 146 were heavily held by funds in the first quarter of this year. There are four companies with a growth rate of more than 100 times in the ranking of the growth rate of the semi-annual reports of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Shanghai Xinmei (600732), Hengyi Petrochemical (000703), Xinhua Group (000620), and Qinghai Mingjiao (000606) ranked in the top four. But the substantial growth in the performance of these four individual stocks was not due to an increase in main business revenue, but either from the gains from the sale of equity or from the restructuring. For companies with such a dramatic increase in performance, funds do not seem to be very interested, and none of the top four performers in the first quarter received the attention of funds. Shanghai Xinmei's year-on-year performance growth ranked first in the two cities at 105370%. Shanghai Xinmei only realized a net profit of 61,600 yuan in the middle of last year. But the company expects its net profit attributable to owners of the parent for the first half of 2011 to be between RMB55 million and RMB65 million. The substantial increase in performance was mainly due to the recognition of investment income from the transfer of shares in Shanghai Xinlan Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., and an increase in revenue from operations carried forward during the reporting period. Perhaps because the growth in performance mainly came from share transfer rather than the improvement of the company's operating performance, Shanghai Xinmei did not have a prominent performance in the secondary market, and in addition, no major funds visited this stock in the first quarter. Ranked second is Hengyi Petrochemical, which listed on the SME board last year, and it is expected to achieve a net profit of 1.124 billion to 1.236 billion yuan in the first half of this year. However, Hengyi’s strong performance was largely due to the restructuring. On June 11, 2011, after the completion of the reorganization, Hengyi Petrochemical immediately issued a profit forecast announcement, expecting to achieve a net profit of 1.124 billion yuan-1.236 billion yuan in the first half of 2011, and the net profit of half a year has exceeded the annual performance commitment. The company's stock price has risen from around 10 yuan at the beginning of the restructuring last year to around 44 yuan at present, and it once reached a high of 54.50 yuan in mid-April this year. China Resources Land ranks third with a performance increase of 193.52%. The performance growth of Xinhua Group also comes from restructuring, and the company has been on a long-term suspension of S*ST Shifang for five years. Once Xinhua Group resumed trading, it experienced a huge increase on the first day of resumption, when the stock price soared from 1.17 yuan per share to 10.52 yuan per share. In addition, Qinghai Mingjiao also saw a more than 100-fold increase in mid-term performance, with the company expecting to achieve a net profit of about 37 million yuan in the first half of the year, up 14478.41% year-on-year. This change is due to the company's transfer of equity in Sichuan Hezhen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and the recognition of corresponding income. There are 18 companies, such as Guanfu Household (002102), ST Zhangjiajie (000430), Meixin达 (002034), Tianrun Real Estate (000711), Xi'an Tourism (000610), etc., with a growth rate of more than 10 times in the mid-term performance this year; and 22 companies, such as Jingwei Textile Machinery (000666), Weike Essence (600152), Shandong Haihua (000822), Meibang Apparel (002269), Taishidao Industry (600667), etc., with a growth rate of 5 to 10 times. The funds had already positioned themselves in advance in these 216 individual stocks with a minimum one-fold increase in first-quarter performance. There were as many as 146 funds that were heavily weighted in the fourth quarter of last year, accounting for as high as 68%. Among them, Weifang High-tech (000581) won the favor of many funds. By the end of the first quarter, a total of 34 funds held Wufei High-tech, with a combined holding of 130,135,100 shares. But the fund still reduced its holdings by 72.46 million shares compared to the previous issue. Huaxia and Yifangda each have four funds holding Weifeng High-tech, respectively holding a total of 27.7388 million shares and 14.0957 million shares. There are five funds under Southern Fund holding the stock, and the champion product of last year, Huashang Shengshi Growth, holds 11,097,300 shares, while its sister fund, Huashang Strategy Selection, holds 8,971,700 shares. There were as many as 32 funds lurking in Jinhua Technology (600143) in the first quarter, holding a total of 205,420,400 shares. Four products under Xingye Fund and Xincheng Fund each heavily held the stock, among which Xingye Fund held the most shares, with a total of 50,375,600 shares. There are five products under the East Wu Fund holding the stock, with a total of 12.8039 million shares held. At the end of the first quarter, there were still funds lurking in more than 20 companies, including Baotou Rare Earth (600111), COSCO Group (000039), Guanghui Corporation (600256), and Tianshan Corporation (000877). Obtaining 10-20 funds in ambush have China North Rail (601299), Shuanglu Pharmaceutical (002038), Jin Tanglang (002081), Shandong Gold (600547), Chen Zhou Mining (002155), Zhongheng Group (600252), Zhonghuan Semiconductor (002129), and 21 other stocks. In terms of industry distribution, the funds favored the petrochemical, plastic and rubber industries most at the end of the first quarter. There were 31 companies in the petrochemical, plastic and rubber industries among the 216 companies with double returns, followed by the machinery and instruments industry, with 20 companies that the funds had been lurking in advance, and the third was the metal and non-metal industry, with 19 companies.\"]\n"

Stars and Stripes reported on February 22 that Colonel Mike Rodenstein, commander of the 35th Fighter Wing, said on base on the 19th that in order to continue training, it was necessary to deploy the pilots and maintenance personnel of the 14th Fighter Wing to other regions such as South Korea for training.

Reports said that Rodenstein did not specify the exact time schedule for the external deployment, only saying that the external deployment would take about two to one month. The three?base is located in the northeast of Japan, which experienced a major earthquake, about 300 kilometers away from the Fukushima nuclear power plant.

A couple was robbed of 62,000 yuan in cash by a man with a fake gun at a self-service bank of the Construction Bank at the intersection of Qingweili Road and Yingwudao in Hankyang at around 11:05 pm on the 25th. After the incident, dozens of police officers searched for the robber overnight, and they caught him and recovered 45,000 yuan in about 10 hours. At the time, Mr. Dong and his wife carried a large amount of cash to the self-service bank to transfer money.

      "['雨枫,九城,魔兽,丁磊,朱骏,于连', '正向', 'Yufeng: Nine City will not fall because of the loss of World of Warcraft. Sina Tech News, April 16, 2019 - The online game industry insider Yufeng said in a live interview with Sina Tech today that although Nine City will suffer losses in the short term after losing the agency rights of World of Warcraft. But with Nine City’s current conditions, it will not fall because of this. The following is a dialogue transcript: Sina Technology: Is iCity the biggest loser in this storm? Who is the biggest winner, NetEase or Blizzard? Yufeng: I think there is only 9 City as the loser, so there is no biggest loser here. The biggest winner is Blizzard, not NetEase. But the loss for Nine City was the vast majority of its revenue, but in the past four years, Nine City has gone public, obtained huge cash, and also obtained the agency rights of EA’s products by operating World of Warcraft. If we look at the results of the past four years, we can only say that it is \"imperfect\" and not that we have lost. Why is it not NetEase that is the biggest winner? As we all know, the price Nine City paid for this product back then was already very high. Today Blizzard handed this product back to NetEase, and I think NetEase\\'s terms this time should not be worse than before. And for the past four years, NetEase\\'s profits have not been very high. Is there a problem here, will operating World of Warcraft by NetEase bring in substantial profits? Currently, my own judgment and that of some friends in the industry is that NetEase\\'s revenue may not be higher than that of 91 Wireless. When NetEase operated Battle.net, the industry\\'s questions were mainly about the impact on NetEase\\'s finances, because the Battle.net model still had many practical difficulties in China. Now that NetEase is paying a high price to acquire World of Warcraft, NetEase and Blizzard will regard this game as an important source of income. Because the Battle.net may not bring in a lot of revenue, but World of Warcraft can. The question is whether NetEase will pay a higher price today than Nine City did in the past four years, as the gross profit margin of World of Warcraft is not high, and Nine City was also constrained by Blizzard in many aspects. In fact, Blizzard had caught Nine City’s Achilles’ heel: with no other sources of income, Nine City could only allow Blizzard to raise prices at will. If this matter were to be placed on NetEase and Ding Lei, in terms of the World of Warcraft product, his haggling ability might not be much more than Nine City. Though NetEase can be said to be a large company with more dispersed income. But Blizzard still held a relatively advantageous position. Sina Tech: Now that it has been confirmed that Nine City has lost World of Warcraft, what impact will this have on them in the short and long term? Yufeng: In the short term, this is bad for Netease. There is no doubt that over 95% of the sources of income have disappeared. In the long term, it may not be a bad thing for NINE CITY. World of Warcraft is too big for Nine City. Because of World of Warcraft, all of Nine City’s resources, capabilities, and the energy of its management staff were completely absorbed. In this state, it was difficult for Nine City to do something else. In the past four years, 9城 has received a large number of industry products that were highly anticipated, but has never succeeded. Besides the problems with the product itself, we wonder whether there is a situation where 9 City is “borrowing from Peter to pay Paul”. Since World of Warcraft accounted for 95% of the revenue, it had to be ensured that it was operating first. In this way, the launch and operation of new products are somewhat weakened. Now that Nine City no longer has World of Warcraft, the company is losing money in the short term. But looking at Nine City itself, it has over 300 million in cash, and EA stands behind it. Will those nine cities fall because of this? Or delist? Start over if necessary. But at this point in time, Nine City is much better off than it was four years ago, and I think that Nine City is not at a disadvantage. Sina Tech: Why did Netease still rely on World of Warcraft after four years? Yufeng: Zhu Jun has been considering how to get rid of his dependence on this game since he took over the agency rights of Warcraft in China, which is also what 9 City has been doing for the past four years. From a financial perspective, he did not succeed. If I were to analyze the reasons, there would be the following reasons. First, Nine City\\'s operational capabilities. It includes market promotion and customer service, as well as the ability to communicate with government departments. Over the past four years, the operational team of Nine City has not improved its capabilities, which is a very serious mistake. Another point is the issue of product line selection. Nine Cities chose mainly the big products that everyone was looking forward to. But in the industry, in addition to big products like World of Warcraft, there are also some small, but very successful, unknown products. Nine City put too much energy into the agency of overseas games, and did not look at the domestic market to find products that are more suitable for Chinese players. Sina Technology: How will NetEase achieve the transition of its products? Why does NetEase have to operate this World of Warcraft game? Yufeng: We have analyzed that, from a financial perspective, although World of Warcraft is a profitable game, Ding Lei did not have to take over this product to achieve a certain goal like Zhu Jun did. Without World of Warcraft, it would be nothing to NetEase. With World of Warcraft, that would be a 10% to 20% growth opportunity for NetEase.  I still haven\\'t figured out this problem, and I think Ding Lei is not for profit. In the past one or two years, NetEase has encountered some setbacks in product development. Products like \"Tang Dynasty Hero\" and \"Heavenly Dynasty 2\" did not succeed, and \"Heavenly Dynasty 2\" was a direct competitor to World of Warcraft. But it was clearly a failure. While NetEase has been doing well with梦幻西游and 大话in recent years, the revenue from its business outside of games has been very little. The income from portal and Youdao search has been unstable. Actually, the agency of World of Warcraft was a signal. NetEase established Hangzhou Research Institute, which focuses on developing free games. And now, in addition to free games, he is also doing agency games. This is a signal of NetEase\\'s strategic transformation, which may no longer confine itself to being an operator of game development and operation, but place itself on a larger platform. But Blizzard\\'s position is very firm, and I believe there are huge difficulties here if we rely on Blizzard to transform. Sina Technology: In June this year, NINE CITY\\'s license will expire. Can you predict how the user data will be processed? Yufeng: There are many ways to talk about this matter. One of the ways of talking is as follows: From the perspective of the contract, the original contract stipulated that all user data was in Blizzard\\'s hands. Because at that time, apart from Shanda, everyone was competing for this game, but only Netease had nothing. If it could not get this game, it could not survive. Now, this clause is very unprofitable. (Coulibaly)']\n"

      "['', '正向', \"CSMCM: Funds Face Refuses to Yield, A Share Market Will Not Rise. □ After the CSMCM Research Institute Strategy Team raised the reserve requirement ratio, the expectation of interest rate hikes has risen again, and the market has therefore seen a continuous break and fall. The one-year central bank bill interest rate in the open market continued to rise by 10BP this Tuesday. As it was within the market's expectation, the market's reaction was rather calm. We expect the PBOC to raise interest rates again in June and July. Before the pressure on the funding face remains significant and the signals of price declines and policy shifts have not yet appeared, the market's bottom-building pattern will not change. Investors can layout large consumption, performance-determined growth stocks, and the aviation sector at lower levels. Growth in the economy slowed moderately in May, with economic data for the month further confirming our judgment that economic growth will continue to slow moderately in the inventory cycle. Industrial added value in May grew 13.3% year on year, stabilizing at a low level from 13.4% in April. Consumer spending and exports showed a significant slowdown in May, but investment demand remained strong, with actual growth continuing to rise. It is expected that the macroeconomy will achieve a soft landing in the third quarter. From the performance of the three horses, investment demand is strong, and the growth rate of final consumption continues to slow down. In May, the year-on-year growth rate of social consumer goods retail sales was 16.9%, lower than the expected year-on-year growth rate of 17.4% in the market, and 0.2 percentage points lower than in April. After deducting the impact of the increase in export prices and the appreciation of the RMB, the actual growth of exports in May was 2.5%, a decline of 9.5 percentage points from April. Investment demand remained strong in May, and after excluding the impact of investment price increases, actual investment growth in May was 19.0%, up 0.6 percentage points from April. The Prudent Deposit Ratio Has Severely Tightened Liquidity Since the end of mid-May, the liquidity of the banking system has been persistently tight. On June 14, the central bank raised the reserve requirement ratio again, making the already tight liquidity even tighter. After this adjustment, the interest rate of the money market funds rose sharply again, which in turn pushed up the yield of government bonds. On June 21, the 7-day SHIBOR interest rate has surged to 8.33%, reaching a new high since February this year, and the overnight SHIBOR interest rate has also risen to a high of 7.14%. We believe that the pressure on the macro funding situation will not ease before the end of June, and the fluctuation of short-term funding rates will increase. First, since June is the key period for the semi-annual financial report assessment of banks, it is traditionally the peak season for funding demand; second, since the excess reserve ratio of financial institutions at the end of the first quarter is 1.5%, it is expected that the excess reserve ratio of banks will further decrease after this reserve requirement ratio adjustment, and the marginal impact on the funding situation will be significantly increased; third, the daily average deposit-loan ratio assessment implemented by commercial banks makes the strategy of banks to shuffle off-balance sheet assets at the end of the month ineffective; finally, since the liquidity tension caused by the previous reserve requirement ratio adjustment has not yet been alleviated, the increase in the reserve requirement ratio this time will further amplify the short-term interest rate fluctuation from both the perspective of funding stock and psychological expectation. The turning point of the price index is emerging, and the tight monetary policy is becoming more cautious. In May, the year-on-year increase of CPI was 5.5%, reaching a new high in 34 months. But from the perspective of the month-on-month data, there were some positive changes in the price trend, with PPI rising by 0.3% month-on-month, a decline of 0.2% compared to April, and the purchase price of raw materials also fell by 0.5% month-on-month. Affected by the翘尾因素, the CPI may set a new high for this round of inflation in June and July, but prices will slowly fall back after that, and it is expected to fall significantly in the fourth quarter. It is expected that the year-on-year growth rate of the CPI in November and December this year will fall back to around 4%. Based on the trend of inflation, if the inflation pressure can really be effectively alleviated in the second half of the year, the decline in prices is a high-probability event. From the perspective of economic downturn risks, the real economy has already shown signs of economic downturn at this stage, and micro-research data also indicate that the demand in the real economy has shown signs of downturn. In terms of the degree of monetary tightening, the increase in the reserve requirement ratio and a surprise interest rate hike will have a marginal increase in the regulatory effect on the economy. So we expect that a moderation in the rate of inflation will be the catalyst for a policy pivot, with tightening measures continuing cautiously through July and August 2011. The bottom pattern before August is difficult to change. We expect that the funding pressure will remain at a high level in June, and the market will continue to form a bottom pattern in the short term. Affected by the lagging effect, the CPI in June is at risk of continuing to rise, but food prices are expected to stabilize in the second half of the year, with a decline in year-on-year growth, and it is expected that prices will peak in June-July and fall in August. With the inflation peak in sight and the economy slowing down, the implementation of further tightening policies in the second half of the year is becoming more cautious. Until the inflation decline is validated by data, the market is still unable to shake off the pressure of inflation, and the short-term market will continue to consolidate its bottom. However, we believe that the market may turn around after August, and the whole year will play out in an “N” shape. After August, the decline in inflation will become clearer, and the core of policy will shift from controlling prices to stabilizing growth and promoting transformation, and the macroeconomy will bottom out in the third quarter. At that time, with investors' expectations turning positive, the forces constraining the market will significantly ease, and the market may see a trend reversal after August. We are optimistic about the consumption sector, including food and beverages, commerce and home appliances, the new growth sector represented by computer information services, and the aviation sector that will enter the peak season due to the acceleration of the RMB appreciation, and we suggest active layout.

Many consumers will choose some small coffee tables, leisure chairs, small entrance cabinets, and other small furniture to decorate their homes before the year. These small furniture are practical and eye-catching, and are very suitable for use in the home during the new year. A small tea table adds a touch of warmth. In the New Year, there are bound to be long-awaited gatherings with relatives and friends. For a small gathering of two or three people, a small tea table for placing tea and snacks is very necessary. Light-colored wooden coffee tables or natural wooden coffee tables are very suitable for matching with the popular light-colored series of sofas today. Their shape is simple, but they are refined, with a gentle tone, no complicated functions, and match the simple and bright sofas to show the beauty of the room. These small tea tables can be moved flexibly according to the needs of use, adding more convenience and ease to life, providing convenience for changing the appearance of the living room, and family and friends will also get a fresh feeling in the New Year. During the New Year, friends gather around a small tea table to drink tea, chat, and play cards, and the warmth of the festival naturally flows to the heart. Small shoe cabinets can brighten up the local space. In general families, the space of the entrance is relatively small. At this time, shoe cabinets with mirrors can make the space appear more spacious, and it is also very convenient for dressing up before going out. It does not seem cramped when guests visit. Various shapes of mirrors are embedded in cabinets with top lines, which look grand and clean. Some white accents can also change the impression of the gloomy dark wood color and add a sense of comfort to the shoe cabinet. The two rows of hooks designed beside the mirror not only facilitate use but also keep the space tidy and uncluttered. Nowadays, people usually place shoe cabinets at the entrance and are accustomed to changing shoes here to remove the dust from the outside. There are shoe cabinets on the market, such as \"screen style\", \"low cabinet style\", and \"corner style\". When choosing, the color and shape should be consistent with the style of the entire room, such as the \"screen style\" design. The space in the shoe cabinet is large, which can be divided into upper and lower layers. The upper part can be used to store the family\\'s seasonal shoes, stored in boxes, arranged in order, and the lower part can be divided into several layers, such as the upper layer is the slippers changed after entering the house, and the lower layer is for daily shoe changes. It is very convenient to use. The Lazy Sofa Brings Holiday Enjoyment Now, a \"lazy sofa\" that pays no attention to \"image\" has become a new favorite in the homes of urban families. It allows white-collar workers who sit upright in the office to sit like a lump of mud at home, unrestrained and even \"forgetting propriety in joy\". New Year\\'s holiday is a good time for leisure, a \"laziness sofa\" makes your holiday comfortable and relaxed. You can treat it as a backrest chair, a single bed, a large sofa, or a fat cushion, as long as you like, do whatever you want. This is a feeling, completely relaxed, with some soft, simple, and free breathing, in the noisy New Year, to start the dream of another year. A \"laziness sofa\" refers to a soft home furniture with wear-resistant and anti-tear fabric or leather as the material, and with small balls of foamed polystyrene as the filling. Its design concept is to constantly break conventions and design according to the scientific theory of ergonomics, to meet the needs of \"any shape, any location, and any surface\". Use detachable outer fabric to maintain a simple and comfortable lifestyle as much as possible. Its charm lies in the fact that you can\\'t help but sit on it as long as it is there, and once you sit on it, you will be embraced by the fullness of the particles with enthusiasm, in short, it can satisfy your needs in the most loyal and complete way in an instant. The leisure chair is the most versatile force in home products, always bringing us grand visual experiences. Most of the furniture in the living room, including cabinets, TV stands, and sofas, are not easily replaced, and after a long time, they may lack novelty. In the home decoration plan for the New Year, adding a few chairs with unique shapes can often become the focus of attention. During the beautiful season of the New Year, sitting alone on a romantic and casual lounge chair, enjoying the most beautiful life sentiment, and enjoying the most comfortable home life. Recliners have different choices in various spaces. The living room is a public area, which is more lively, so the leisure chair must be eye-catching and unique in style, becoming a scenic spot, and it should also be comfortable to sit on and match the sofa properly. There are not many kinds of bedroom furniture, and adding a lounge chair to the bedroom is one of the ways for a person to adjust their mood. The休闲 chair in the bedroom should match the bedroom environment. The color and style should not be too jumping to avoid \"disturbing\" the quiet space. The lounge chair in the study requires a balance between functionality and comfort.']\n"

Market Judgment: Adjustment after Accelerated Rise The market may accelerate in June under the impetus of banks and other weighty sectors, which may then trigger a real round of adjustment. It is recommended to choose sectors and stocks from the perspective of catch-up, thus taking into account strategic defense. 2. Industry allocation: banks lead, focus on midstream industries, the top three industries we are most optimistic about this month are finance (banks, securities, insurance), steel, and petrochemicals; we have a forward-looking view on midstream industries such as steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemicals, shipping, and papermaking, which benefit from economic recovery and rising prosperity. Main reasons and logic: (1) The turning point of the spread, the undervaluation of valuation, the re-flood of liquidity, and the recovery of the US and European economies and stock markets will support the rise of finance, especially the banking sector, which will in turn promote the prosperity of the index. (2) Looking forward, we are optimistic about the recovery of the business cycle in the middle industries such as steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemical industry, shipping, and papermaking. Because this is an important criterion for a genuine recovery of the real economy. The recovery of the two leading industries of automotive and real estate will pull the economy out of the trough, and industrial production will continue to rise in the second quarter, which will eventually lead to an increase in fund allocation to midstream sectors such as steel as market confidence in economic recovery strengthens. (3) Keep an eye on oil prices and be cautious about coal and non-ferrous metals. The economic recovery of the European and American economies has basically been established, and the dollar exchange rate has fallen due to reduced demand for risk, which has pushed up the commodity market. In addition, with seasonal factors, oil prices can be relatively optimistic in the third quarter, which may push up the product prices of industries such as petrochemicals. Although we are still bullish on coal, new opportunities will have to wait until the fourth quarter after the general over-allocations and significant price increases in the fund. Datong Coal Industry, Pingmei Corporation, Panjiang Corporation, and China Oil Chemical Construction need to wait for the timing of the asset injection event. 有色板块 earnings support is weak and does not have a safety margin, and it is recommended to reduce positions at high levels. (4) Market style switching is essentially a catch-up behavior, which is also an important factor in improving the defensive nature of the investment portfolio. We believe that the main sectors of catch-up will be in the midstream industries (steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemicals, papermaking, transportation, etc.) and consumer goods sectors (food and beverage, commerce, etc). 3. Individual stock selection strategy and key recommendation portfolio from top to bottom, and combined with the recommendation of Guoxin industry analysts from bottom to top, we suggest the key recommendation portfolio for June as follows: China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, China平安, Liaoning Chengda, Gaoxin Hongxing, Angang Steel, China Unicom, Qingdao Haier, Huatai Paper, Chenzhou Mining, Xinko Materials, Yunnan City Investment, Zhongtian City Investment, Shanxi Three Dimensions, Liuhua Corporation, Fuyao Glass, Guoyang New Energy, China COSCO Shipping, Wuliangye.']\n"

      "['', '正向', 'Rising Star released the Q3 network phishing report: Internet users lost more than 5 billion yuan. On October 12, Rising Star released the 2010 Q3 Network Phishing Report, which pointed out that more than 10,000 new phishing websites appeared every day, of which 95% were automatically generated by machines, and traditional anti-phishing technology was difficult to identify. In addition to traditional phishing websites, online fraud has combined with client software and even traditional telephone fraud, becoming a prominent feature of new types of fraud, such as brushing points and brushing credit, which have become common methods for hackers to make money. Rising transaction volumes of online ticket booking, online shopping, and online gaming during the summer vacation and Mid-Autumn Festival in the third quarter have led to a significant increase in losses from phishing scams and indirect losses, according to security experts from Risen. The estimated losses may be as high as 5 to 7 billion yuan. Rising reports also listed some cases, including the new types of phishing fraud such as “QQ brushing diamonds” and “Taobao brushing credit”. But these websites usually directly defraud users\\' mobile phone bills and money in their accounts, so they are extremely harmful. And these activities themselves are in a gray area of illegality, and even if netizens are defrauded, they often remain silent because of the belief that “this is wrong anyway.” In late August, Risheng\\'s \"cloud security\" system launched its anti-phishing function, and provided intelligent cloud support for the 2011 test version of \"Risheng\\'s full-featured security software.\" Since its launch, more than 470,000 phishing websites (calculated by URL) have been intercepted, which is dozens of times more than the number of interceptions before it was launched. Based on the latest data from the intercepted phishing websites, about 20% of the phishing websites only last for one day, and 80% of the phishing websites do not survive for more than a week. This makes traditional interception of phishing websites ineffective, with more than 70% of phishing websites slipping through the net. Rising security experts said that the new version of Rising 2011 software to be launched will adopt an intelligent way to judge according to the color, layout, behavior characteristics of the phishing website, and the interception effectiveness rate will be more than 90%. No matter how phishing websites change their domain names or modify their own features, they cannot escape the \"wisdom eye\" of Rising Star. Lottery scams account for 90% of all phishing sites, according to the data in the Risen Report, which shows that 550,000 phishing sites were intercepted in this quarter (80,000 were intercepted in the traditional way before August), and the trend is accelerating. Among them, phishing websites that appear in the form of \"fake lottery\" and \"fake shopping websites\" account for more than 90% of the total, and in specific events, a certain type of \"Li Gui\" website will have a corresponding \"outburst\". For example, a large number of \"lottery websites\" that emerged during the \"Sina Weibo One-Year Anniversary\" event, or the various realistic \"airline websites\" that emerged as the summer vacation approached. This kind of phishing website is well-made, and it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity from the page information alone without carefully distinguishing the address. RS security experts have tracked and monitored the typical websites added each month, and found that although the number and form of phishing websites are increasing, the average survival period and click times of the websites are gradually decreasing. Currently, more than 80% of phishing websites will not survive for more than a week, and some even survive for just a few hours. This indicates that as the \"fishing technique\" continues to be exposed, people\\'s security awareness is constantly improving, which also promotes the \"fishing websites\" to change their deceptive methods in a timely manner, and appear in a more deceptive form. How does QQ Diamond Scam to make money? QQ, a famous chat software, has various membership levels that require recharging to obtain. Sometimes, by using certain techniques, you can upgrade to a higher membership level in a short time, enjoying larger storage space, online storage of QQ chat records, and other thoughtful services. Hackers exploit the eagerness of netizens to upgrade to a premium member by claiming that by using a certain software, they can take advantage of vulnerabilities in the Tencent system to upgrade to a higher level member at a lower cost or even for free in a short period of time. A search for \"QQ brushing diamonds\" on Baidu can find 700,000 results. According to the monitoring of Risen Company, there is a \"QQ brushing diamonds cheat\" download on the prominent position of the first page of the search results. These software have two ways of cheating: the first is to bundle a Trojan in the software and force to modify the IE homepage and pop-up ads to get benefits. This trick is easy to spot after use, and is not commonly seen nowadays. The second approach is more sophisticated, as the software prompts the user to \"enter a phone number to upgrade to yellow diamonds,\" after running the \"drill brushing cheat.\" Actually, after you fill in the mobile phone number, it will ask you to \"activate a certain package\", and the software interface will argue that \"the package is only for verifying the authenticity of the mobile phone number and does not charge any fees\", but in fact, it will charge various package fees.']\n"

If asked, how much do you know about the earth? Do you really understand low-carbon life? If a mobile phone can calculate the amount of carbon dioxide produced by a person in a day and compare it with the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by plants, would you buy it? If the answer is yes, the Sprint customized LG eco-friendly phone Remarq is just right. In addition to achieving the above functions, Remarq itself is thoroughly environmentally friendly. The body part is made of recyclable plastic material, and the utilization rate of recyclable materials exceeds 87%. Even the machine's packaging box is made from recycled paper, and there is no paper manual in the packaging, users can find relevant materials online. But the phone still has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, a 1.3-megapixel camera, and a QVGA screen. Back to the original question, would you buy such a mobile phone? For environmental protection, the entire machine can basically be refined from recycled waste, so the operator has wisely positioned it at the level of zero consumption for two-year contracts.

The 12 national winners are currently in Nanchang preparing for the first Red Song Hero Gathering on Sunday (August 2). However, this concert, which is mainly about reviving classics, has been questioned for its lack of originality due to the elimination of individual contestants. The individual players with unique personalities have all lost. After three years of hosting, this year\\'s program, which is believed to be favored by middle-aged and elderly viewers, has seen more contestants in their eighties and nineties. Among them, there are students of vocal music, as well as quite a few bar singers who follow the so-called \"national popular\" route. Although the old judges repeatedly said that they were happy to see young people singing red songs, the singers who were called \"having ideas\" by the audience were eliminated and left the stage one after another. Dingdang, who incorporated new elements into works such as \"Fly Higher\" and \"Run,\" was eliminated in the first round, while Liang Fan, who adapted the classic \"Water Flows in the Creek\" into a soul version, also failed to advance in the second elimination round. Old songs performed in a new style were opposed, and red songs were questioned for lacking originality. Many young viewers were dissatisfied with the fact that these new red singers, who were not only talented but also had ideas, were eliminated. However, these individual contestants, who were favored by young viewers, did not receive high evaluations from the old judges. The Dingdang group and other contestants were told by the judges that it was disrespectful to the original authors to casually adapt old songs during the preliminary rounds, and Liang Fan was even asked to change the song during rehearsals. In an interview with the media in Shenyang, judge Jiang Dawei said that the new red songs are not adaptations of old works, but original works that truly reflect the times. In fact, it is not just judge Jiang Dawei who believes that red songs need to be original. Recently, an industry insider pointed out that the Red Song Competition encourages contestants to sing classics, and no original works are produced. The program itself is not marketable. But some people also believe that those who like red songs are mostly audience with orthodox thoughts and positive life attitudes, and the idea of re-reading classics just suits their taste. According to a staff member of the Red Song Column, most of the singers will choose to sing classic old songs in the first Red Song Hero competition held on Jiangxi TV on Sunday, but it is not excluded that some contestants will perform their original works.

In this incident, Li Tianyi, the son of Li Shuangjiang (Weibo), was not 18 years old, but was suspected of provoking trouble and intentional injury, and was also suspected of driving without a license because he had not obtained a driver\\'s license. And as监护 people of Li Tianyi, what legal responsibility should Li Shuangjiang and Meng Guo bear in this incident? There are all kinds of speculations online, and yesterday, I consulted with Dai Pingheng, a lawyer from Zhelian Law Firm. Beijing Haidian police issued a statement to the media yesterday that Su and Li have been lawfully detained by Haidian Public Security Bureau on suspicion of disturbing public order, and are currently under further investigation. Attorney Dai Pingheng introduced that the crime of provoking trouble refers to the behavior of making trouble and stirring up trouble in public places, beating and injuring innocent people, provoking trouble without reason, bullying and tyrannizing, and destroying public order. If proven, it may be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, criminal detention, or public surveillance. If they are minors aged over 14 but under 18, they may be punished less severely. But the Criminal Law also stipulates that persons who are over 14 but under 16 years of age shall bear criminal responsibility only for intentional homicide, intentional injury resulting in serious bodily injury or death, rape, robbery, drug trafficking, arson, explosion, and投放毒物. According to the existing materials, Li Tianyi was born in April 1996, and by September of this year, he would be 15 years and 5 months old, which is not yet 16 years old. Therefore, if his date of birth is correct, he does not need to bear criminal responsibility. Li Shuangjiang and his wife may be held civilly liable. Dai, the lawyer, said that in this case, the victim can hold Li Tianyi’s guardian, Li Shuangjiang and Meng Guo, civilly liable, and the injured can claim civil compensation, including medical expenses, loss of work, nutritional expenses, and mental damage, etc. In addition, Li Tianyi’s driving without a license when he caused the accident also became a focus. A source said that the car was previously owned by Li Shuangjiang\\'s wife Meng Guoqiang, a white BMW. In May this year, he accompanied Li Shuangjiang\\'s son to the \"BMW Yi Biouo Modification Club\" for modification, which turned into a luxury modified car with black as the main color and orange trim, with a modification cost of about 270,000 yuan. According to the law, if the vehicle color, engine, body or chassis is changed and the change is not applied for within 10 days to the vehicle management office, the public security traffic management department shall impose a warning or a fine of less than 200 yuan; if the appearance and technical data registered on the motor vehicle are changed without authorization, the public security traffic management department shall order the restoration to the original condition and impose a warning or a fine of less than 500 yuan. Since minors are not allowed to take a driving license, Li Tianyi is considered to be driving without a license. According to the regulations, the public security traffic management department may impose a fine of more than 200 yuan and up to 2000 yuan, and may also impose detention for up to 15 days.']\n"

Sina Finance News, on January 28, 2021, at 3:15 am, after the two-day interest rate meeting, the Federal Reserve announced that it would maintain the 0-0.25% benchmark interest rate range unchanged. This is in line with the general market expectation. The policy statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after the meeting noted that it expected to maintain ultra-low interest rate policy for a considerable period of time and to end the purchase of mortgage-backed securities by the end of March. Moreover, the Fed’s assessment of the economic outlook is slightly more optimistic than in its previous statement. The Fed also said it would end the credit auction program for banks in March. Some analysts commented that during the two-day closed-door meeting, Fed officials had a lot to talk about in terms of interest rates and economic outlook, but they would not make many public statements. Former Fed director Laurence Meyer said, \"From the perspective of what the Fed will do, this may be a boring meeting, but from other perspectives, it is particularly interesting.\" Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital, said that the controversy over Bernanke’s nomination for a second term at the Fed will only make the Fed more low-key. The Senate will vote this Thursday on whether to approve Bernanke\\'s reappointment. Market analysts generally expect that President Obama\\'s nomination of Bernanke for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve will be approved. Another interesting question is the prospect of the US economy. Fed officials have long indicated that they do not expect the unemployment rate to improve much in the short term. Most economists believe that the Fed will not start tightening policy until there are clear signs of improvement in the labor market. Thus, analysts generally expect the FOMC to reiterate in its post-meeting statement that the federal funds rate needs to remain at historically ultra-low levels for an extended period of time. Most Fed watchers expect the central bank to reiterate today that most special liquidity facilities will end on February 1, and that the Fed may also announce that its plan to purchase $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities will end as scheduled in March. The Fed watchers also noted that there may be a fierce debate among Fed officials about the exit strategy, masked by the appearance of no major changes in the statement. The FOMC’s statement from its December meeting noted that it would “discuss alternative approaches to longer-term monetary policy implementation at future meetings.” Observers view this as tantamount to revealing a secret: Fed officials still do not know what the optimal exit strategy is.']\n"

The two parties will cooperate in the field of news, advertising, radio and television, and provide academic education services for more people engaged in media work or those who are interested in the media direction. It is reported that the cooperation between Openg and China Media University had entered the discussion stage as early as the beginning of 2009. Ma Qian, deputy director of the Open Platform for Distance Education Center, introduced that \"The strength of China Media University in the field of media is beyond doubt. We are very precious about this cooperation. We spent more than a year discussing and planning the cooperation model, cooperation scope and future development direction, etc. This is inseparable from the uniqueness of China Media University in network education.\" Previously, China University of Political Science and Law has always relied on the radio and television system to carry out network education, and has independently developed a teaching management platform and built a complete course resource system. These accumulated teaching and management experiences are very precious. After the signing ceremony, Wu Yanxiong, the president of the Distance and Continuing Education College of China University of Culture and Communication, revealed the deep reasons for the cooperation between the two sides. He said, \"In recent years, the Chinese media industry has developed rapidly, and the realization of social recruitment is the requirement of the development of the whole industry.\" And Open Education\\'s keen market perception, teaching support service capability, and comprehensive social service capability, and so on, are exactly what we need for our media industry education and talent cultivation work. Therefore, after multiple on-site visits, we finally chose to cooperate with AoPeng Education. Such cooperation will be a win-win cooperation. And \\'cultivating elites in the field of media\\' is our common goal for this cooperation! According to industry experts, the formal signing of the cooperation agreement between the two parties will further expand the student population covered by AoPeng Education, and also has great significance for the expansion of its on-the-job training and academic education models. Meanwhile, CUPT has taken a big step towards providing comprehensive socialized teaching services for network education. As we know, since its establishment in 2001, Ao Peng Education has cooperated with more than 43 key domestic universities including Peking University, Zhejiang University and China Media University, and more than 500,000 students, and teachers from more than 1,400 learning centers provide 24-hour full-time academic counseling services for students. In 2009, Open Education created a \"compatible\" model for online academic education and vocational education. Students can obtain relevant vocational qualification certificates at the same time as they receive their graduation certificates, which to some extent promotes the improvement of professional talent quality.']\n"

      "['黄楚龙,李华,陈华,张睿,黄老板,王石,陈劲松,岗厦,东永峰,锦峰,方锦峰,刘世成,黄氏', '正向', 'It is alleged that the anti-corruption campaign in Shenzhen may involve a large number of developers. During the four years from 2005 to 2009, when Shenzhen’s housing prices soared, several private real estate businessmen stood out, among whom were Huang Chulong, chairman of the Shenghe Real Estate Group, Li Hua, chairman of the Zuyue Real Estate Group, and Chen Hua, chairman of the Jingdian Real Estate Company. They could acquire land in the central districts of Shenzhen through unconventional means such as agreement transfer, and benefited greatly from the rapid rise in Shenzhen’s housing prices, thus being at the center of the real estate storm in Shenzhen. Central district land acquisition expert Huang Chulong, reported by Zhang Rui, a reporter from Shenzhen. Among the big shots in the real estate industry in Shenzhen, Huang Chulong, the chairman of Star River Real Estate, cannot be ignored. This property businessman, who is used to being called \"Dragon Brother\" and always calls himself a \"Chaozhou native\", has become one of the top \"big brothers\" in the central urban area of Shenzhen since he started his business in Shenzhen in 1979. It is rumored that Huang Chulong has left Shenzhen. Times Weekly reporters visited Huang Chulong multiple times. On the morning of June 12, at the Star River real estate company, his office door was open, and a pair of slippers was left at the door. The reporter immediately called his mobile phone, but until the deadline, Huang Chulong’s phone was always forwarded to the answering machine, and Huang Chulong was out of touch. Guangjiang猛龙 Huang Chulong, a real estate developer in Xinhe, is well-known in Shenzhen. Drivers in Shenzhen are all familiar with the projects in Xinghe. The houses in Xinghe sell well because of their excellent location. A broker from Re/max 21st Century (Re/max 21st Century blog) told the reporter from Time Weekly that \"Yellow Boss is very strong, and he always gets good land in the central business district.\" Around the three subway stations in the core area of Shenzhen Metro Line 1, there are four projects developed by Shenghe Real Estate. Like many property developers, Huang Chulong started out as a construction worker. He came to Shenzhen to start a business when the special economic zone was first established in 1979. He did the work of a mason very well, and later gradually became a contractor, undertaking the construction of Shennan Avenue (Shanghai Hotel to Shubu Road) in Shenzhen. With the first pot of gold earned as a construction boss, Huang Chulong established Shenzhen Yihetou Enterprise Co., Ltd. in 1998, which was the predecessor of Star River Real Estate. Huang Chulong transformed into a developer. In April 1994, Huang Chulong established Shenzhen Xin Yihuo Industrial Development Co., Ltd., and subsequently developed multiple projects such as Xianghe Garden, Yihuo Building, and Haiyue Huacheng. In December 1999, Xin Yihuo was renamed Shenzhen Star River Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. Shenzhen’s famous real estate commentator, Totem Mirror, recorded the “discussion” of Vanke Group chairman Wang Shi (Wang Shi blog), Shenghe Real Estate chairman Huang Chulong and Shenglian Real Estate (Shenglian Real Estate blog) consultant joint-stock company chairman Chen Jingsong at a dinner table on his blog. Chen Jingsong sighed at the dinner table that Shenzhen\\'s private real estate companies had not been able to go out, and Huang Chulong immediately resonated: \"That\\'s right, I have also been to many cities.\" Deeply touched: unfamiliar with the land and water, and the water and soil are not suitable. Drink five catties of white wine at noon, and six catties in the evening. If you continue to drink, you will have to give your life, so I have to withdraw. It was this businessman, who was unfamiliar with the local conditions in other cities, who ran his real estate business in Shenzhen with ease. In Shenzhen, listed companies such as Vanke and China Merchants often cannot obtain land in the central area, which is monopolized by a few private real estate companies in Shenzhen. A person in charge of a large real estate company in Shenzhen told reporters from Times Weekly. Huang Chulong\\'s star river is one of the \"monopoly big shots in the central area\". In 2002, the Star River International, located between Fuhua Third Road and Binhe Avenue, was sold smoothly, allowing Huang Chulong to truly stand firm in the central area of Shenzhen. By 2005, the projects of Star River Real Estate had blossomed. And they also caught the real estate boom in Shenzhen from 2005 to 2007. According to the statistics and analysis of the Shangdi #zhPoint#Baanqiu Studio, a real estate consulting firm in Shenzhen, for every 100 square meters of commercial buildings in Shenzhen\\'s CBD, 12 square meters are supplied by Shenghe Real Estate. “Gongsi Men” shook off the past and compared with other real estate developers, the land reserve of Xinghe is not much, but it is precious in its \"scarcity\". In the real estate industry in Shenzhen, which is full of talents, this over-the-river dragon could defeat many opponents. The choice of land and the ability to acquire land are beyond doubt. In February 2003, Huang Chulong won the land auction in Shenzhen for a total price of 180 million yuan and a 8-year interest-free installment payment, and acquired the present Shenghe Development Center and the Ritz-Carlton project. On December 23, 2003, Huang Chulong suddenly turned his attention to the area outside the city and bought a plot of land of 170,000 square meters in Longgang District for 250 million yuan. Now, the plot of land, which is in Longgang Central City, is being developed as the planned political, economic, and cultural center of Longgang. Beyond its substantial financial strength, Huang Chulong’s ability to acquire land is also remarkable. The Shenzhen Land and Resources Bureau\\'s records show that the two projects, Shenghe International and Shenghe Century, which Huang Chulong successfully developed in the city center, both have a \"agreed transfer\" source of ownership. Among them, the Star River International project was obtained in 1999. And the transfer date of the Star River Century Tower is September 13, 2004, and the source of property rights is also agreement transfer. After the deadline of land in August 31, 2004, all business land use rights must be transferred through bidding, auction, and listing. How did Star River obtain the land use rights for the Star River Century Tower project through agreement transfer? While the Southern Metropolis Daily reporters were verifying the information from multiple sources, on June 16, a case involving the Star River Century Tower was publicly tried at Futian District People\\'s Court. Huang Chulong\\'s involvement in the Xinghe Century project is alluded to in this case. According to the reporter of Time Weekly, the Star River Century plot was originally one of the plots involved in Shenzhen\\'s \"returning land to the people\" policy, and the right to use belonged to the Gangxia Industrial Corporation. In March 2000, under the introduction of Dong Yongfeng Company, Shenzhen Gangxia signed a cooperation agreement with Jinfeng Company and Dong Yongfeng Company to jointly develop the land, with Gangxia Company providing residential land and Dong Yongfeng Company and Jinfeng Company providing construction funds. After the completion of the project, the company got 11,000 square meters of property, while the rest of the property belonged to Dong Yongfeng Company and Jinfeng Company. But during the process of development and construction, unexpected changes occurred. According to the 86 employees and shareholders of Jinfeng Company, on January 13, 2004, the legal representative of Jinfeng Company signed an agreement with Dong Yongfeng Company and Gangxia Company to withdraw from the development of the land. On January 12, 2004, Dong Yongfeng transferred the project to Star River Real Estate. The plaintiff believes that the legal representative of Jinfeng Company did not convene a board meeting and a shareholders\\' meeting, did not listen to the opinions of the trade union and employees, and withdrew from the development of the project without their consent, and merely recovered the initial investment cost, which caused economic losses to Jinfeng employees and shareholders. And believes that during the operation of the project, including the major shareholders of Jinfeng Company, Shenzhen Futian Investment Development Co., Ltd., Dongyongfeng Company, and several defendants such as the legal representative of Jinfeng Company, there was a malicious collusion, so they all sued the court. And Futian District People\\'s Government was also sued as a defendant because it was believed to support and promote the infringement behavior of other defendants. The plot is complex and confusing. To this day, the information from the Shenzhen Land and Housing Bureau still shows that the developer of the Star River Century project is Shenzhen Dong Yongfeng Real Estate Co., Ltd., and the details of how Star River Real Estate intervened and obtained the Star River Century project through agreement transfer are still a mystery. Liu Shicheng, general manager of Xinghe Real Estate, told reporters from Times Weekly that he was unaware of the matter. ” Huang Chulong’s sense of the江湖, people in the real estate industry in Shenzhen always can’t help to evaluate him as generous, loyal, with many friends and broad social connections. The江湖 sentiment of Huang Chulong also laid the foundation for his status in the circle. The Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce\\'s publicly available information shows that the Happy Enterprise Company, which Huang Chulong established earliest, had the Shatou Street Office of Shatou District, Shenzhen City, as a shareholder in the capacity of the supervisory unit. Huang Chulong\\'s generosity is not only reflected in his real estate projects, but also in the descriptions and photos of his son\\'s lavish wedding in 2007, which have been widely circulated on the Internet. A fellow villager of Huang Chulong revealed that Huang invited about 500 villagers to a hotel for a big feast, and gave each of them a 400 yuan red envelope, which was called the \"most amazing wedding\" by netizens. Those who are familiar with Huang Chulong have found that he wears a string of prayer beads on his wrist and neck. A source said that Huang Boss is a businessman who is good at making money, and at the same time, he is a believer who gives away his wealth to worship Buddha. Huang Chulong\\'s business philosophy is also often talked about in the industry. When the reporters of Times Weekly visited the new headquarters of Star River Real Estate on the 17th to 24th floors of the Star River Development Center, they found the Yellow Clan\\'s aphorisms pasted on different floors—\"Good for you, good for me, good for everyone, that\\'s really good\"; \"Do things after being a person, be round on the outside and square on the inside.\" I want to comment.']\n"

Jin Qian Online reported that the police set up a checkpoint at the toll station to check and intercept drugs, and caught a man and a woman on a bus. In the end, they followed the trail and arrested their upstream and upstream upstream one by one. Surprisingly, one of the drug dealers was a judicial officer. Recently, Guiyang Intermediate People's Court heard the case and made a first-instance judgment. At about 2 PM on November 24, 2007, the Guiyang police set up a checkpoint at the Jin Guan toll station in Guiyang. In a large bus from Liupanshui to Guiyang, 410 grams of heroin were found on a woman. Another man, Hu Yuanjie (from Zijin County, 57 years old now), who was traveling with the woman, was also arrested. After Hu Yuanjie was arrested, he expressed his willingness to make meritorious contributions and assist the public security organs in apprehending his superior, Tie Fachui and Ma Yuhuo, a couple from Yunnan. At 10:00 a.m. on November 29, 2014, the couple Tie Fachui and Ma Yuhuo, who were conducting drug transactions in a guesthouse on Health Road in Ludian County, Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province, were arrested by the police, and 468 grams of drugs were seized on the spot. After that, the police arrested drug dealer Wang Dehui at a hotel in the western district of Kunming at around 2:00 PM on December 2, based on clues provided by Hu Yuanjie, and seized 3050 grams of drugs. After Wang Dehui was arrested, she voluntarily confessed that the 3050 grams of heroin she sold was given to her by a man named Ning Gongwei, and at that time, the two agreed that Wang Dehui would find a buyer, and after the drug was sold, Wang Dehui would pay 750,000 yuan in drug money to Ning Gongwei, and the excess would be Wang Dehui's kickback. Ning Gongwei asked Wang Dehui to transfer 750,000 yuan of drug money into two bank cards and informed her of the card numbers of the two cards via text message. With Wang Dehui's cooperation, the police arrested Ning Gongwei in Lincang, Yunnan Province on the afternoon of March 7, 2008. It was found that Ning Gongwei is a judicial police officer of the Justice Bureau of Gengma County, Lincang City, Yunnan Province. Ning Gongwei admitted that in November 2007, he had negotiated with Wang Dehui to sell heroin, which he had obtained from a Burmese person. After that, he contacted Wang Dehui and handed over this batch of drugs to him. Recently, the Intermediate People's Court of Guiyang City made a first-instance judgment on this case, sentencing Ning Gongwei and Tie Fachuì to death for selling drugs, confiscating all their property; Ma Yuhé to life imprisonment, and confiscating 30,000 yuan of his property. Given that the defendant Wang Dehui and Hu Yuanjie had significant meritorious service, they were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve for the crime of selling drugs, confiscation of all personal property; Hu Yuanjie was sentenced to 15 years in prison and confiscation of 10,000 yuan in personal property.

      "['姚明,罗恩-阿泰斯特,阿泰斯特,麦蒂,姚麦,里克-阿德尔曼', '正向', 'Expert: There are three major hazards for the rocket to take off. Yao Ming will no longer be injured, which will be a miracle. Sina Sports News. On December 5th, according to star-telegram. com, based on the existing information, a careful and responsible prediction: Houston Rockets will end the regular season as the fifth in the west. After the Rockets acquired Ron Artest during the off-season, this prediction was quite different from those inflated claims, you know, from so-called experts who thought this team would make it to the finals. The current Rockets are troubled by one problem, that is, injuries. Even before the Rockets\\' training camp, there were reports that after his first career surgery, McGrady\\'s knees were still in pain. In the past four games, McGrady sat out for this reason. And, according to the latest news, this seven-time All-Star player will not appear on the court for the next three weeks. Over the past three seasons, McGrady missed 62 games. It is not a secret that Tracy McGrady was the most talented basketball player of his generation, but at the age of 29 – perhaps, you would be surprised that he was so young – after 11 seasons in the NBA, he was already a broken man. Who would have thought that eleven years after entering the league as a high school student, Matt would be like this today. Besides Matti’s knee injury, the two other main players of Rockets, Yao and Artest, also have their own troubles, the former is foot, the latter is head, and Rockets’ prospects will not be optimistic if any of them “outbreaks”. Over the past three years, Yao Ming missed 86 games in total due to injuries in different parts of his body. As a 7-foot-6-inch, 310-pound center, Yao Ming\\'s body bears unimaginable pressure when he runs back and forth and jumps constantly. Last season, Yao missed 35 games due to a navicular fracture, and was season-ending injured when the Rockets most needed him. Not long after the surgery, Yao Ming was overworking again, representing his country in the Beijing Olympics. So, if Yao Ming can play all the games in this season, it will be a miracle. Let\\'s talk about Artest again. It must be admitted that Artest is not lacking in talent, and he can play dominantly on both ends of the court. However, in his career, he has caused trouble by fighting, abusing animals, and taking leave to promote his album. Metta World Peace\\'s head, Yao Ming\\'s foot, and Tracy McGrady\\'s knee, these three factors combined made the Rockets the most unreliable team in the league. All the guys who predict that the Rockets have a chance to win the championship will not forget to add a premise - if Yao and Mccoy can stay healthy, if Artest will not cause trouble again. When asked about the team\\'s health issues, Rick Adelman, the Rockets\\' coach, said, \"I should ask you, \\'Which players will I have tomorrow (for games and training)? \\' As for the comings and goings of the players, this is a topic that has no beginning or end. There is no doubt that the Rockets are very competitive, and they have been the top team in the Southwest Division for a long time. Under the circumstances of being full of injuries, they are actually doing quite well now. Because of that 22-game winning streak, last season\\'s Rockets were one of the most astonishing teams. And, in the team\\'s last 10 victories, there was no Yao Ming. Besides the Lakers’ 33-game winning streak in the 1971-1972 season, the Rockets are the team with the longest winning streak in history. But what do these represent?']\n"

      "['李先生,向先生,陈钦', '负向', 'A two-year-old child kicked a tea table with a gap. Consumers angrily smashed \"paper\" furniture in public. Joyfully moved into a new home, but did not expect that the \"solid wood tea table\" bought was kicked with a gap by a two-and-a-half-year-old child. Upon closer inspection, we found that the thin layer of wood veneer on the coffee table was actually all honeycomb cardboard. Yesterday, Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang, who live in Hengda Mingdu, came to a well-known home furnishing mall on Wanhua Li Road in anger to seek an explanation from the merchant. Consumers smashed the \"paper\" furniture with a few blows. Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang live in the Hengda Name Park, and they are neighbors. In March this year, they bought two sets of sofas, two coffee tables and two TV cabinets from the左右布艺 sofa series store in the home appliance mall together for 25,700 yuan. Mr. Xiang paid the full amount in one lump sum. I paid in full because I liked the brand \"Zuowei\" and the staff at the specialty counter claimed that the coffee table and TV cabinet were all made of solid wood at that time. Expressed to Mr. Xiang. However, unexpectedly, on October 9, Mr. Li’s 2.5-year-old child kicked a hole in the coffee table while playing at home. Mr. Li carefully examined the gap and found that there were some pieces of hard paper under the veneer. Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang, who were angry, moved the coffee table and TV cabinet to the front of this home furnishings mall yesterday afternoon and smashed them in public. A few blows and a strong pull, and the furniture is split into several pieces. It is not wood, but filled with honeycomb cardboard. Honeycomb paper of the merchant is a new process, and it has never promised to be solid wood. Later, the journalist followed the staff of Dongtundu Industrial and Commercial Office of Fenghuang District and Mr. Xiang and Mr. Li to the store of左右布艺sofa series. The sales staff in the store denied the oral commitment to be solid wood furniture, and the store manager also stated that they never promised to sell solid wood furniture to consumers, and they do not sell solid wood furniture. The reporter carefully checked the scene and found that there was indeed no promotion of solid wood furniture in the store, and there was no indication of what materials were used in the products on the price list. So, even if it is not solid wood furniture, is it in compliance to make furniture out of cardboard? Then the store manager took out a stack of documents proving that the products were qualified, and claimed that the sofa purchased by Mr. Shang and Mr. Li was from the \"Left and Right\" brand, but the coffee table and TV cabinet were not from the \"Left and Right\" brand, but from their partner \"Culture Dragon\" furniture, which was clearly marked as made of real wood veneer and high density board in the promotional brochure, which the two consumers had not noticed. Using honeycomb paper to make furniture is a way that many furniture manufacturers use. Honeycomb paper is energy-saving and environmentally friendly, and it also meets the relevant national standards. The official also stated. The Administration for Industry and Commerce should note the material of the furniture on the contract. After carefully checking the furniture that was damaged by the consumer and understanding the situation from both parties, Chén Qīn, the director of the Dōngtūndu Subdistrict Office of Fúróng District, said that they still need to further investigate whether the honeycomb paper process meets relevant national standards and quality requirements, and to understand the specific production process of the goods in detail. It is currently uncertain whether Left and Right Sofas have engaged in fraudulent practices against consumers. The industrial and commercial administrative department will investigate this matter. \"']\n"

This week (6.22-6.28) \"The Hero of the Villain\" broadcast the finale of the TV version, the ending is still unsatisfied, the ratings soared to the highest point since the opening, with an average rating of 4.0, defeating the Golden Melody Awards ceremony at the same time, winning the ratings champion. And on Sunday, Fuki You Kangang also reached the highest point since its broadcast with a rating of 4.36, with the male and female leads Chen Qiong\\'eng, Lan Zhenglong, and Qiu Ze celebrating the success by riding a Ferris wheel, symbolizing that the ratings will continue to rise. 痞子英雄: A Satisfying Ending The 24 episodes of The Heroes of the Zodiac ended the TV version of the plot, and in the ending, Chen Zaitian, Xiaoma, and Wu Hero fought bravely against the head of the mercenary organization Saccochi as the righteous side. The martial arts fight of Zhou Yumin and others, who showed their kung fu, became the climax of the ending. Many suspense is left to the movie version. Since the director\\'s ambition is not just to make a TV series, the audience can only wait for the movie version to come out in suspense. To be precise, the TV version is only two-thirds of the story, and the framework of the characters is just beginning to take shape, with the real main plot still to come. Though this TV+movie approach is innovative, it is an overly hasty conclusion for the TV version. Hao Xiaomei\\'s sudden appearance, Chen Zaitian and Chen Lin\\'s love story, and the true purpose of the newly emerged secret organization Paradise are all the big suspense left by the TV series. The suspenseful ending left a large number of viewers unsatisfied. Despite the somewhat mysterious ending, the show ended on a perfect note with a viewership of 4.06. Looking at痞子英雄, which claimed from the beginning to \"represent the current highest production level of Taiwan\", it has indeed opened up new fields for Taiwanese idol dramas in many aspects, living up to the slogans proposed in the publicity. Whether it is the plot that strives to be as compact as American TV series, or the high-cost production of the explosion and gun battle scenes, it has given people a new understanding of Taiwanese idol dramas: idol dramas can have high IQ plots like \"Prison Break\" that are intricately linked, allowing viewers to participate in idol dramas with suspense and the fun of guessing. A truly good drama requires seamless cooperation in all aspects, and of course, the actors who are most concerned by the audience are the ones who bear the greatest responsibility. They perform with their hearts in front of the camera, and whether the audience can understand the plot is largely dependent on them. This drama gathered a large number of excellent new and old actors in the Taiwan TV circle, and the veteran actors\\' veteran actors\\' spirit is naturally beyond doubt. In the young generation, Zhao Yutong and Chen Yihan gave a powerful performance, leaving a deep impression on the audience. The coolness of Zhao Yutong and the cuteness of Chen Yihan were fully displayed in this play. It can be foreseen that through this excellent production, their acting road will be smoother. The soul of the whole play is Zai Zai Zhou Yumin, who has played for nine years and has given the best performance to the role of Tian Panzi Chen. Even director Cai Yuexun praised Zhou Yumin\\'s maturity as an actor, saying that he has already transcended the idol category. With \"Good Luck and Good Health\" leading the Sunday drama slot, the show has already aired its fourth episode and has been the top-rated show for four consecutive weeks, making Mavis Chien\\'s \"Queen of Ratings\" position more and more stable. Currently, the variety show on Sundays is dominated by \"Good Fortune\". The Korean drama \"Boys Over Flowers\" broadcast by CTS and \"Knock Knock, I Love You\" broadcast by ETS are completely unable to compete with it in terms of ratings. Romantic comedies always like to use the sweet kiss scenes of the male and female leads as a selling point to attract viewership. In the fifth episode preview, there is a kiss scene between the male lead, Zhenglong Lan, and Chen Qiong. It is believed that it will cause a small peak in the viewership of \"Prosperity and Peace\". (Second Master/Wen) The ranking of the idol drama ratings on Sunday, June 28, 2009, from 9:30 PM to 12:00 AM. 1. Happy and Healthy (TaiShi) 4.36 2. Boys Over Flowers (ZhongShi) 2.83 3.

Promotional activities such as discount sales, cash lottery, special prices for samples, gift packages, limited edition抢购, thousand yuan bidding, and CEO signing are being launched in stores across the country. The scale and intensity of the activities are the largest of the year. After more than 20 reporters from our local bureaus across the country interviewed, it was found that overall, the promotional situation during the \"National Day\" period was not as good as the merchants expected, and the market situation was not optimistic, with a chill in the promotional situation in the sales area; however, there were also some local areas and individual sales areas that performed well. The market is in a state of cautious observation. In Beijing, the weather is slightly cool, but the enthusiasm of major retail outlets and merchants for holiday promotions has not diminished. They are working hard, hoping to achieve some success during the National Day holiday. During the \"National Day\" promotion, the reporter went to the USI in Beisihuan Fourth Ring Road and saw that many shops were deserted, including international brands such as American Standard, and the products in the store were not sought after. There were relatively more people at the entrance of the Arrow bathroom exhibition hall, as the store was offering a 5-6 discount, attracting many customers. According to the salesperson of the Rome bathroom, their store sales this year have dropped by half compared to last year, and the sales of the entire mall are not as good as before, and are rather cold. During the “National Day” holiday, the tiles area of Zhongshan Home was even more deserted, with no customers in each store. According to the dealers in the industry, the sales of many brands have been in a declining stage this year, and it is considered a good performance to maintain the same level as last year. Gu Cheng, a Huinai staff member, is more optimistic about the sales difficulties in Beijing. According to him, the sales of tiles this year are still rising, but the increase is smaller than in previous years. Although the “golden September and silver October” is said to be the peak sales season, the impact of the housing restriction policy on Beijing has made many potential consumers in a state of observation, and it is still difficult to open up this situation at present. Journalists learned from large sales venues such as Building Materials City, Wanliasudeng Decoration City, and \"Good Home\" Building Materials Decoration Market in Haidian District, Beijing, that the real purchasing demand of the people is suppressed, and the market atmosphere of watching and waiting is thick. It is expected that the sales volume of \"Silver October\" will also be difficult to achieve breakthrough progress. The market is lukewarm and the performance is low. The Shanghai Yishan Road Building Materials Market is located in the bustling Xujiahui business district and is one of the largest building materials and home decoration markets in the local area. There are constant large and small promotional activities in Kolaseng, Xinglidala, Xiyiming, Jashijia, and other sales venues. According to the reporters, the brands and enterprises were relatively popular in the first three days of the \"Golden Week\" of October, such as TOTO sanitary ware, but the overall market was depressed. It is understood that the revenue of the Kola Sheng building materials market in the first half of the year has shrunk by six or seven tenths compared to three years ago. During the visit, the journalists learned that some merchants, after struggling to hold on, have already considered changing their careers. Since the end of September, the southeastern region of Guangxi has experienced continuous rainfall due to Typhoon Nasa, and most of the merchants\\' promotional activities during the National Day Golden Week have been \"washed away\". Before the National Day, many dealers expected to \"boost sales during the Golden Week\". According to the previous year\\'s situation, the National Day, as one of the most important nodes for product promotion, could account for 15%-17% of the annual sales. However, the continuous heavy rainfall since the National Day has caused great inconvenience for consumers to go out for shopping. The foot traffic at the Nanning Fu An Ji (Langdong) Building Materials Plaza is a little more than usual, but it still seems quiet compared to the festive atmosphere of the store. Some merchants said that \"golden September and silver October\" had turned into \"cold September and bitter October\", and the gloomy situation would be a certainty throughout the year. During the \"National Day\" Golden Week, some ceramic markets in Chengdu were happy while others were sad. Fushun Meijia and Red Star Macalline were still crowded on the first two days of the National Day holiday, while Bohme Decoration City (West Gate) and New Century Decoration City were somewhat deserted, with significantly fewer visitors than the first two markets. Salespeople of well-known brands such as FuSen CCB Construction Materials, Anhua sanitary ware, and Jin Yi Tiao have been busily engaged in the National Day promotion, becoming the main actors of the promotion drama; while the sales of most second and third-tier brands are not much better than usual. In the major building materials markets of Kunming, the journalists saw that the foot traffic in the markets was significantly higher than usual due to the promotion. During the visits, some merchants expressed satisfaction with the sales during the National Day holiday, which basically met their expectations. But the overall sales performance of the market still did not meet expectations. Consumption Potential is Yet to be Released During the previous \"Golden September and Silver October\", the sales performance of the building materials industry was closely related to the promotional activities of merchants. As long as merchants launched promotional activities during holidays, the sales situation would be good. The construction materials industry, like the real estate market, has been in a depressed state this year, affected by real estate market regulation policies and a series of interest rate hikes that have tightened the money supply. According to an incomplete statistics, the sales of the national real estate market in September fell significantly again. 新房 sales volume in major cities across the country fell by 25% on a weekly basis in September, with first-tier cities falling by 31%, second-tier cities by 22%, and third-tier cities by 23%.']\n"

Dominic, who originally lived in the castle with his grandmother, Queen Marie, also went into exile abroad and eventually settled in the United States.

On the 13th, a South Korean fishing boat mistakenly entered Japan\\'s exclusive economic zone, and the captain was detained by the Japanese side for ignoring the warning. The Japanese Coast Guard and the South Korean Marine Police faced off briefly, but then conducted a joint investigation. The fishing boat ignored the warning and fled. The Japanese media reported that at around 10:30 am on the 13th, a patrol boat of the Japanese Fisheries Agency discovered a suspicious ship in the Japanese exclusive economic zone near Hyogo Prefecture, and then tracked the ship\\'s whereabouts, and finally found that the ship was a Korean fishing boat engaged in crab fishing in the Japanese exclusive economic zone. The fisheries patrol boat immediately requested the ship to stop and stop working to accept inspection, while the Korean fishing boat, finding its tracks exposed, fled the scene despite the warning. Japanese patrol boats immediately notified the coast guard vessels patrolling in the nearby sea and requested assistance in pursuing the Korean fishing boat. Around 11:30, the Japanese side intercepted the Korean fishing boat and arrested the captain on the grounds that it violated the relevant fisheries laws of its own country. But this message has not been confirmed by the Korean side. It was reported that the fishing boat had sounded the alarm during the escape, and the 5001 warship of the Korean coast guard rushed to the scene after receiving the message. After the two sides communicated, the Japanese side agreed to investigate the matter together with the South Korean side. After the investigation, both sides confirmed that \"the South Korean fishing boat did indeed infringe on Japan\\'s exclusive economic zone.\" The South Korean fishing boat was only washed into the Sea of Japan, and the South Korean media later confirmed that the fishing boat that entered the Japanese EEZ was the \"33 Shuanglong\"号. But the two sides have different views on the allegation that the fishing boat intruded into Japan\\'s EEZ. The South Korean media do not recognize the claim that the South Korean fishing boat worked in the Japanese EEZ. The media quoted a South Korean government official as saying that the fishing boat had only strayed into Japan’s EEZ by mistake and had not carried out any operations, and that it had drifted into Japanese waters due to engine failure. The Japan Coast Guard did not use the term \"confrontation\" to describe the encounter between the two countries\\' maritime security forces. The South Korean government expressed hope that the incident would not affect the atmosphere of cooperation between the two countries.

On September 19, China News Network reported that the Taipei District Court held a hearing on the \"state confidential fee\" case today. Chen Shui-bian\\'s wife Wu Shu-chen submitted a statement to the court yesterday, stating that she was unable to appear in court due to poor health, but was rejected by the collegial panel. The collegial panel also instructed the National Taiwan University Hospital to move a hospital bed, emergency facilities and medicines to the eighth court, and doctors and nurses were on standby in court today, showing the determination that Wu Shu-chen must appear in court today. Wu Shuzhen was appointed a lawyer on the 16th to submit a lawsuit to the court, stating that she fainted \"once or twice a day almost every day\", and could not appear in court; but the collegial panel rejected her application, as she had no medical certificate, and the National Taiwan University Hospital had already made medical preparations in accordance with the court, and Wu Shuzhen\\'s appearance in court would not pose an immediate danger to her life. Chen Shui-bian\\'s office issued a press release yesterday, denying that Wu Shu-chen had ever made a request for leave, and stating that it was a criminal \"statement of facts\" to the court, asking the court to accompany with professional medical personnel from NTU to understand whether Wu Shu-chen was suitable for appearing in court. As for Chen Shui-bian’s possible role as an assistant to Wu Shu-chen when she appears in court, pro-Chen people revealed that Chen and Wu are both defendants, and Chen Shui-bian is “inappropriate and unnecessary” to serve as Wu Shu-chen’s assistant. Although the flat office denied that Wu Shuzhen had asked the court for a leave of absence, Huang Junming, the administrative court chief of Taipei District Court, said that whether the defendant\\'s filing was a leave of absence should be determined by the content; Wu Shuzhen stated that the content of the complaint had the meaning of a leave of absence. The legal community believes that the denial of Fu\\'s leave by the Fu office is just a ruse to claim that it is only submitting a \"criminal statement\", but anyone who reads the content can see that it is a leave of absence. Why does the Fu office have to play word games. Su-Chen Wu appointed lawyer Seng-Hung Lee and Xue-Xing Liao to submit a statement to the court on the afternoon of June 16, stating that Wu Su-Chen had a fracture at the end of June and needed to be supported and elevated; she had a cold last month, which has not yet been cured, and in the past week, she fainted one or two times almost every day. The Taipei District Court said that the collegial panel decided to take a ten-minute break every half hour of the trial, and if necessary, Wu Shuzhen could lie on the hospital bed prepared in the court to testify, and there were medical equipment and professional medical staff of the National Taiwan University Hospital on standby in the court, Wu Shuzhen must appear in court to testify. It was also reported that, in order to facilitate the interrogation of Wu Shuzhen, the National Taiwan University Hospital was asked by the court to assign medical staff and emergency equipment to the hospital. But the medical personnel assigned to be on call in court have been avoiding it. It is understood that the emergency department of NTU can only arrange for one doctor and one nurse to be on standby at Taipei District Court today through coordination, and the emergency department has already carried out a tabletop exercise for Wu Shuzhen\\'s possible condition. Chen Shui-bian\\'s office said Wu Shu-chen did not request a leave of absence, and the confidential fee case will be tried again. Chen Shui-bian said Wu Shu-chen fainted twice recently.']\n"

According to the reporter Zhang Xiaohuo, recently, the Korean SBS daily drama \"Wife\\'s Temptation\" has shown amazing potential, not only in South Korea, the ratings are rising, but also in China, there are many netizens watching the fastest updates online every day. What kind of magic weapon does \"Wife\\'s Temptation\" use to \"tempt\" the audience? Submissive Wives Have a Day of Anger is about a traditional Korean woman who is betrayed by her husband and friend, nearly killed, and later avenges herself under another identity. The leading lady, Nc-tae (played by Zhang Ruxi), is a gentle and kind wife, while her husband has been having affairs with her good friend since before their marriage, and has continued to seek new conquests after marriage. Her talented good sister has always been jealous of her marriage to a wealthy family. Before her marriage, she seduced her fiancé. After studying abroad for several years and returning home, she continued to seduce her husband. After she became pregnant, she even brought a little boy from abroad, saying that it was her husband\\'s child. Later, in order to marry her husband smoothly, she forced her to divorce and conspired with her husband to harm her, making her fall into the sea. After they thought she was dead, they happily got married. After Nencai was saved, the child was lost, and she did not contact her relatives. She was very angry to see her in-laws, ex-husband, and that friend continue to harm her family in the dark after her death. She decided to appear as another identity, seduce her ex-husband, and abandon him after he broke up with that woman. The extreme personality of the characters is a highlight, in addition to the plot being captivating, it also played a role as seasoning. The grandmother (Kim Baek-ra), who exhausted all her skills to humiliate her daughter-in-law, and Shin Ae-ri, her good sister who did all kinds of evil things with her grandmother, have provoked the audience\\'s anger. When the plot developed to the point where Nanche fell into the water and was rescued by Jianyu, the audience cursed the evil husband Zheng Jiaobin and the evil Shen Ailin on one hand, and sought comfort from the kind and mentally disabled aunt (played by Wu Yingshi) on the other. Zhang Ruxi\\'s energetic performance as the mermaid princess is also a key ingredient of the play. It was her hard work that made \"Wives\\' Temptation\" resonate with the audience. 3 ways to make women more popular would dress up. Encai changed her name to Min Sujee. After \"rebirth\", the first lesson she took was dressing. Through continuous imitation and learning, she transformed from a slightly rustic girl with a big face into a stunning lady that everyone loved. Although her appearance was similar, her temperament was different. No one could recognize her true identity. The drama sparked a \"Chang Rui Xi effect\" in the Korean fashion industry, and many clothing companies imitated the costumes she wore in the drama crazily. Of all the words \"秀外慧中\", Nenchai has the deepest understanding. To play the role of Min Sushee, who returned from studying abroad, Encai studied foreign languages, swimming, golf, dancing, painting, and financial management so diligently that even Jiaobin himself said, \"Before, I thought that women who approached me were all for money, but Miss Min, you are so rich and talented, and you can look at me, I am really blessed in three lives and three deaths... \" Encai, who is not good at being spoiled, did not say a word even when her mother-in-law was extremely difficult and her husband betrayed her. But after she reincarnated as Min Sue-ki, she spoke softly and tenderly to her ex-husband; and when she had a conflict with her rival, she immediately put on a pitiful victim’s face as soon as Jiao Bin appeared, arousing his protective instinct. Netizens do not agree with Encai\\'s way of revenge. In the drama, Encai, who was a simple and kind virtuous wife, turned into a woman full of hatred for revenge. The 180-degree turn made the audience feel satisfied while also feeling sorry for her. Miss Li, the audience, said, \"Although she has become more beautiful and more profound after the revenge, she is very scary. We can no longer see her former innocence. She is always calculating how to take revenge. Such a character can appear in TV dramas, but we don\\'t want to see such characters in real life.\" Ms. Zhang, a viewer, also said, \"I only love N\\'s later appearance and inner qualities, and do not approve of her extreme way of revenge. In fact, she was hurting herself while taking revenge.\" \"']\n"

Game players all like the 3D function of their own computers to be powerful, so that they can play large 3D games. As the hardware of mobile phones and tablets is constantly upgraded, the performance of handheld terminal devices is getting stronger and stronger. Some mobile phones can handle 3D tasks without any problem, such as the Nvidia Tegra2 CPU, which is equipped with a GeForce GPU, and its 3D performance is comparable to that of old PCs. On a long journey, holding a mobile phone in the car, playing a splendid 3D game. Not only is it a pleasure for oneself, but it also attracts envy from those around. Which mobile phone processors support 3D acceleration? Let's take a look now. Recommended model: LG Optimus 2X (parameters, quotations, images, forum, software) (P993) Reference price: 2680 yuan Mobile features: handsome and rugged appearance, powerful and powerful performance Simple and fashionable, rugged LG P993, equipped with the world's first mobile terminal dual-core processor Nvidia Tegra2, the performance is 10 times that of existing smartphones. As the world's first dual-core phone, it leads the mobile phone into the dual-core era. It is quite powerful, integrating an NVIDIA GeForce GPU, which brings excellent mobile 3D gaming experience and fast 3D interface response. LGP993 has a straight shape, with a simple and fashionable appearance. It is a bit large in hand, with a strong sense of weight. Although the interface position is awkward, the overall feeling is not bad, and the big HDMI characters on the dust cover at the top of the body are very attractive. Meanwhile, the silver trim design adds a fresh touch to the back of the body, but the silver trim is not wear-resistant and is prone to scratches. An 8-megapixel camera and an LED flash are located on the upper part of the body. LGP993 has a 4.0-inch capacitive touch screen on the front, with a resolution of 400x800 pixels and a color depth of 16 million colors, which tends to be mainstream. The display is very good, LGP993 is equipped with Android 2.2 intelligent operating system, in combination with LG's secondary development interface, has the sliding unlock function, up to seven screen split, and practical functions, and the 3D effect is also very obvious, supports GSM/WCDMA network system. LGP993 uses a Nvidia Tegra2 dual-core processor with a high clock speed of 1GHz, supporting 3D acceleration. When running large 3D games, the power of this CPU is fully demonstrated. The memory combination is 8GB ROM + 512MB RAM, which can easily handle various storage and program installations, and there is no need to worry about ROM being insufficient. But the 1500mAh battery is a bit hard-pressed to cope with the dual-core CPU and 4.0-inch super-large screen. Editor's review: This mobile phone is handsome and rugged, with a high screen resolution and bright display effect, outstanding photography effect, and a dual-core chip that supports 3D acceleration, and supports 1080P video recording, which makes it a sexy machine god in people's hearts without exception. But the RAM is relatively small, and it is likely to be affected to some extent in the future when upgrading, and the battery life is also a headache.\"]\n"

Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, June 6 (Reporter Li Jingchen Rao Bo) - Pakistani military spokesman General Abbas said on June 6 that it would take about a year to completely clear the armed forces in the conflict area in the northwest and restore calm. Abbas made the above remarks at a press conference held at the headquarters of the PA\\'s Public Relations Department on that day in response to questions. He said that the security forces had killed a total of 1,305 armed militants since the military operation began in the northwest region at the end of April, and that 105 security force members had also been killed. Over the last 24 hours, security forces continued to conduct operations in several areas of the northwest frontier province, killing 17 militants in the Swat valley, and one security force member was killed. Abbas said that security forces would continue to be stationed in the areas of conflict. He said that the security forces have not yet decided whether to go to South Waziristan to strike at the militants, which will depend on the government\\'s decision. Abbas also said that the leader of the banned religious organization, Sufi Muhammad, who heads the \"Movement for the Implementation of the Prophet Muhammad\\'s Code,\" was not arrested. The group had announced to the media that Sohaila Mohammed was arrested on April 4. In February this year, the government of the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan reached an agreement with the \"Movement for the Implementation of the Prophet Muhammad\\'s Code\" to apply Islamic law in the Malakand district, including the Swat Valley, once the Swat Valley, which is currently occupied by Taliban militants, is restored to peace. The agreement was unanimously adopted by the National Assembly (lower house) on April 13. But the Taliban fighters in this region refused to lay down their arms and occupy some government institutions, and attacked security force checkpoints. The army then launched military operations in the Dir, Buner and Swat regions separately, targeting the Taliban militants comprehensively.']\n"

      "['冯鑫,张绪旺', '正向', 'The暴风影音 \"lost\" millions of clearing vulgar advertisements. Are Internet companies willing to cut off their own advertising revenue? Feng Xin, CEO of FengXin Video, recently said that FengXin Video will start to conduct a purification check of advertising materials in January this year, and continue the \"anti-ad\" action. This measure will cause FengXin Video to lose nearly 10 million yuan in annual revenue. It is reported that the incident originated from a netizen who used the floating advertisement slogan of the left bottom frame of暴风影音2011 New Year edition, \"15-year-old girl with a good figure\", to leave a message for Feng Xin on Weibo, expressing dissatisfaction with the vulgar advertisements on Feng Xing. Two days after a netizen\\'s comment, Feng Xin responded on Weibo: \"In order to completely get rid of the ridicule of \\'15-year-old girl with a well-proportioned figure\\' and to avoid giving people an unpleasant viewing experience, we finally decided to do a purification check of the advertising materials under the premise of bearing the loss of income.\" This is the暴风\\'s second \\'ad-free\\' action after removing the button ads on the playback window, which may result in a loss of tens of millions of yuan in annual revenue, to be carried out in January 2011! And Feng Xin himself later confirmed the content of the Weibo. Currently, domestic video websites are burning money at a fast pace on bandwidth and servers, with high cost inputs, leading to the fact that even first-tier video websites with revenue reaching the billion level are difficult to make a profit, and advertising revenue is an important channel for video websites to achieve break-even. This means that for暴风影音, continuously clearing millions of yuan in advertising profits twice in a row is akin to a \"suicide\" action. Industry insiders say that analyzing the two times Feng Xin cut off the advertisements together with the promotion of high-definition videos by Thunderbolt Video, it shows that the focus of competition in the video industry has shifted to the user experience. From the perspective of hundreds of millions of video users, the video industry will increasingly focus on competition in experience. Feng Xin is determined to clear out the vulgar advertisements, which is a long-term investment for him to value the user experience and expand the video market share. Feng Xin once announced that暴风影音 would start its Nasdaq listing journey around 2012. This series of consecutive reputation-building measures can be seen as preparations for a long run by Feng Xing, or as an adjustment of its own business to operate in a more healthy way. After Feng Xin announced the removal of low-quality advertisements, many microblog users left messages to express their support. And the more important factor behind the affirmation of such behavior is that the user\\'s feelings are respected by the enterprise. Reporter Zhang Xuwang of Commercial News']\n"

Sina Sports News, on April 5, 2018, Paul Gasol has not rested this season. If he can continue to play, the home winning streak of Los Angeles Lakers (55 wins and 21 losses) against Utah Jazz (36 wins and 41 losses) should continue. The Lakers, who had just lost their nine-game winning streak, needed to bounce back, and Kobe Bryant and his teammates would not miss the opportunity to win at home. Following their loss to the Nuggets, the Lakers ended their nine-game winning streak, and the gap between them and the Western Conference leaders, the Spurs, widened to two and a half games. But while the Lakers were more concerned with player health than with the challenge of facing the top seed in the West, bad luck often comes in threes. Gasol was fouled by Nene while dunking in the third quarter, and his right knee was hit by the opponent. After the check, the Spaniard\\'s right knee suffered a bone contusion. Whether he can play will be determined before the game. Actually, my feeling is much better than yesterday, which is a good signal, and I feel good. \"Gasol told the press.\" Gasol feels good, but is Phil Jackson willing to take a chance? After all, the Lakers are a championship team, and the result of a regular season game is not so important, so \"the Sage\" is likely to arrange for Gasol to rest. Andrew Bynum also suffered a knee injury against the Nuggets, but his condition is much better, and he should be able to play tomorrow. With Bynum and Lamar Odom in the lineup, the Lakers\\' frontcourt can ensure a certain level of competitiveness, which may also prompt Gasol to be rested. The importance of Gasol in the paint is beyond doubt, and if he cannot take the court, other big men must provide more help to the team. As the team leader, Kobe naturally shouldered more responsibility. The Lakers still need five more wins to reach 60, and Jackson\\'s teams have all won the championship after reaching 60 wins before. \"There will always be ups and downs on the court, you don\\'t need to pay too much attention to people\\'s praise and criticism,\" said Kobe. \"You just need to do what you should do and play at your best level.\" As Kobe said, they only need to play to their highest level against the Jazz. The Lakers have won 17 consecutive games against the Jazz at home, including the playoffs, and they have not lost to the Jazz at home since January 2, 2006. Last Saturday, when the Lakers visited Salt Lake City, they overcame a 17-point deficit to defeat their opponents. Five players scored in double digits, and they will need to have multiple scorers in their attack tomorrow. The Jazz\\'s recent performance has been terrible, they have suffered eight consecutive losses, and they have not had nine consecutive losses since March 5-20, 2005. The 2004-05 season was the only season in the past 27 years when their winning rate was less than 50%. After they lost one game, they were only one game away from a sub-.500 record when they received the King\\'s team. The Jazz have had a poor record, and injuries are one of the reasons. Devin Harris, Andrei Kirilenko, and Rajon Rondo have all been troubled by injuries, which have weakened their strength. Kirilenko and Barea may not be able to return to Los Angeles, and Harris will depend on the situation before the game. But inside, the Jazz have Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap, both of whom are strong inside players, and their performance will directly affect the team’s fate in Los Angeles. The expected starting lineups are as follows: Lakers: Fisher, Kobe, Artest, Duhon, Bynum; Jazz: Watson, Hayward, Miles,米尔萨普,Jefferson(Melody)']\n"

Abbas made the above remarks during a meeting with Christian Bérenguer, the EU representative in the Palestinian territories. He said that any new military action by Israel against the Gaza Strip would have a serious impact on the peace process and would lead to the failure of the international community's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abbas introduced the latest developments in the Israeli-Palestinian situation after Israel refused to stop building Jewish settlements on occupied territories to the EU representatives and called on the EU to play a greater role in the peace process between the two parties. Recently, Israel has increased the number of airstrikes and tank attacks on military operations in the Gaza Strip, mainly targeting military positions of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) controlling the Gaza Strip.

According to a report by Liu Yongge, director Yu Zhong, Sun Sun, Sichen Gao, Song Chunli and others are starring in the drama. Yesterday, the reporter drove to the shooting site of Longxing Ancient Town in Yubei, where Siqin Gaowa was shooting the first scene after arriving in Chongqing, which was the opposite scene with Song Chunli. It was rumored that the two had fallen out after filming the TV drama \"Mother\", and even refused to appear on the same stage. But yesterday, the two not only shared snacks but also had a close discussion about the script, showing off their sisterly affection to the reporters. Siqin Gaowa had a closed anesthesia while shooting. Siqin Gaowa played the mother of a high official of the Nationalist Party in the drama, with a high status, and was assassinated by secret service agents of the保密局 because of her pro-Communist behavior. Song Chunli, on the other hand, played Sishen Gao娃\\'s good sister, whose identity was the deputy secretary of the underground party. The reporter saw the two actors chatting and making dumplings, with a relative bringing people to see the family\\'s antiques. But the scene was shot for the whole afternoon. As she had just arrived in Chongqing, Siqin Gaowa looked very tired. She took out a medicine box and took several kinds of medicine during the shooting break. Siqin Gaowa smiled bitterly and told the reporter that she was shooting the play with a closed leg: \"My legs and feet are not good, which is an old problem. I have a cold these days, and my throat is not good.\" When I came, I just got a block, and the needle was directly inserted into the bone of the elbow, otherwise I couldn\\'t have lasted. On the side, Song Chunli took out a bag of hawthorns with concern, \"Eat this, it can invigorate and moisten the throat.\" Then the two of them talked about their own health conditions while eating话梅 together. Before the hit drama \"Mother\" was broadcast on TV, the media once revealed that the two main actors, Song Chunli and Sichen Gao, had a serious falling out, and even refused to appear on the same stage when they participated in the recording of a certain program. Song Chunli once clarified this, but neither did Sicheng Gaoova. Yesterday, she admitted that it was very enjoyable to act on the same stage again: \"I don\\'t want to respond to those boring reports. The more I say, the more wrong I am. You can see that we have nothing to compete in acting, everything is very natural.\" Off stage, we have no secrets from each other. At our age, we cherish our feelings for each other very much.

According to a report by Zhao Jin, a reporter, China Telecom (00906.HK) announced its first half of the year performance in Hong Kong yesterday. The financial report shows that the total revenue of China Telecom in the first half of this year was 41.125 billion yuan, including 505 million yuan of amortization income of initial installation fees, down 0.15% year-on-year. Meanwhile, China Netcom's net profit for the first half of the year reached 5.877 billion yuan, up 11.9% from the same period in 2007. China Netcom said that the main reason for the increase was the change in tax rates and the non-cash transaction gains. ChinaNet's traditional fixed-line business faced severe challenges in the first half of 2008, especially as local fixed-line telephone users continued to decline and revenue continued to fall. By June 30, China Netcom had 108 million local telephone subscribers, a decrease of 2.31 million from the end of 2007, of which, fixed telephones decreased by 1.49 million and Little Smart decreased by 811,000. Affected by this, the local call charges of China Telecom in the first half of the year were 9.072 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 11.8%; the telephone monthly rental fee was 5.132 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 23.4%; the domestic long-distance call charges were 3.945 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 11.8%; the value-added service income was 2.993 billion yuan, a slight decrease of 1.38%; the inter-network settlement income was 3.951 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 6%. Meanwhile, China Telecom's capital expenditure in the first half of this year was 7.527 billion yuan, down 10.7% year-on-year, with fixed telephones and Little Smart investment accounting for only 4.4% of the total, down 13.2 percentage points year-on-year. While fixed-line voice services were in sharp decline, ChinaNet announced that it had vigorously expanded innovative services such as broadband, with broadband service revenue increasing by 38.8% to 8.859 billion yuan, accounting for 21.8% of total revenue, up 6.1 percentage points from the same period last year. As of June 30, the total number of ChinaNet broadband users reached 23.36 million, up from 17.12 million in the same period last year, and the number of broadband users increased to 23.98 million by the end of July. Li Fushen, the CFO of China Telecom, said that the company plans to add 8 million broadband users every year from 2008 to 2010. -Related news China Unicom's net profit doubles in the first half of the year. According to a report by Zhao Jin, China Unicom (00762.HK) announced its 2008 first half financial results yesterday. China Unicom's net profit was 4.419 billion yuan, an increase of 1.03 times compared with 2.177 billion yuan in the same period last year. The earnings per share were 0.324 yuan, and the turnover increased by 4% to 35.135 billion yuan. As China Unicom plans to sell its CDMA business this year, it is listed as discontinued operations, and the CDMA business made a profit of 650 million yuan in the first half of the year.\"]\n"

      "['', '正向', 'Expert advice: Four methods for answering common self-study questions. 2. Several methods for answering common types of questions. 1. Single choice questions: It is best to find the correct answer quickly and accurately. If you are not sure, you should use the elimination method, that is, you should start by eliminating the most obvious incorrect options, leaving the options that are close to the correct answer, and then analyze and compare the remaining options, further eliminating one by one, and finally selecting the correct answer. In fact, in the four options of many single-choice questions, except for one correct one, the other three are not completely wrong, but just do not meet the requirements of this question. Some options are transplanted from other chapters by the question setter as distractors. Check the order of the questions and then recall the order in the textbook to make the right choice. 2. Multiple Choice Questions: Many multiple choice questions are based on a single basic question, and the examiners list several key points of the question as the correct options. Among the distractors, some distractors are obviously wrong and can be excluded immediately, while some distractors cannot be judged right or wrong at a glance, and even they are not wrong, but just placed in the wrong position. Just like in single-choice questions, choose according to the order of the proposition and the textbook, which is still effective. Moreover, after selecting, you must write in the order of the options A, B, etc. 3. Explanation of nouns: The answer should be concise, comprehensive, and accurate. As long as you understand it. You can explain it in your own words, without being bound by the original text. If you can\\'t answer, then by the name, guess and explain its meaning according to the question. 4. For the short-answer questions, try to search for the key points in your memory. When answering, the answers should have a hierarchical structure, highlight the key points, and write them neatly on the answer sheet. The language should be concise and clear. No matter how many points you come up with, you must divide them into paragraphs when answering, and avoid writing several key points in a single natural paragraph. 5. Essay: List the key points, then expand on each point one by one, fully demonstrating your abilities. Try to make the content as rich as possible in both depth and breadth. If necessary, you can first list the key points of the answer on the draft paper and think about how many you can elaborate on. If the time is tight, just answer the key points on the test paper (note to segment and leave some blank space to prepare for narration), and then use your imagination, don\\'t be afraid of random thoughts, and try to expand the narration of the key points as much as possible. Make sure to add more content based on the key points of the answer. Five, make up for 1, make up for the fill-in-the-blank questions. If there are still several questions that you can\\'t do in the single choice questions, you may as well take a chance and choose one option uniformly, that is, choose A, B, C, or D. Generally speaking, it is not a problem to get one point back, and sometimes you can get more points with good luck. Multiple-choice questions are much more difficult. If you can\\'t think of anything, select ABCDE for all of them. How it works depends on your luck. 2. Make-up for non-choice questions. Read the questions and answers of each choice item (including the incorrect options) and the questions and answers of the other non-choice items that have been completed repeatedly. Sometimes you will suddenly realize it. If that still does not work, you can only write some key points of the answers, but the written content must be the content of the course being examined, and do not put the cart before the horse, and start from a macro perspective (i.e., broad coverage) to explain, and try to make it self-consistent. Six, after finishing one subject, find a place to rest. Don\\'t participate in discussions among candidates or compare answers with each other, and don\\'t check your answers by reading books yourself. What has been tested is in the past, and it is useless to think about it. We should seize the time to clear our minds. At this moment, the more relaxed we are, the better. In fact, this is a mental preparation for the next test. Seven, the above techniques have five or six major points and 17 or 8 minor points. If candidates can use all of them well, that is, each point can get at least one more point \"unexpectedly\", the total will be about 20 points, and the effect is self-evident. Conclusion. A thousand techniques and myriad techniques, the most fundamental technique is still to study hard and master knowledge. Based on the author\\'s many years of experience in self-study, the most effective techniques are to do the following: 1. Familiarize yourself with the outline. The Syllabus is the basis for learning and assessment, and it makes provisions for the knowledge points, assessment requirements, degree of difficulty, types of examination questions, etc. of the course. Recommended - The Examination Outline promulgated by the National Higher Education Self-study Examination Committee. 2. Study the textbooks. Textbooks are the specific elaboration and systematic exposition of the course knowledge stipulated in the Examination Outline, and all the questions are derived from the textbooks. Recommended - Textbook designated by the National Higher Education Self-study Examination Committee. 3. Use study guides. The tutor book is a teacher to help digest, understand the outline and textbook. It is recommended to choose a study guide that not only helps to pass the self-study examination smoothly, but also improves comprehensive abilities such as thinking and memory. Recommended: \"Quick Memorization of Charts for General Courses of Self-study College Entrance Examination\" and \"Quick Memorization of Charts for General Courses of Self-study Bachelor\\'s Degree\" (published by Sichuan People\\'s Publishing House). 4. Master the learning methods. Good learning methods can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Recommended - \"Talk on the Methods of Self-study\" (search on www.zikao211.com). 5. Use test-taking skills. Recommended——this article. With the above points done well, you will definitely pass the exam in one go. For more information, please visit the Sina Self-study Channel, Self-study Forum, and Self-study Blog Circle. Special Note: Due to the continuous adjustment and change in various aspects, all the examination information provided by Sina.com is for reference only, and candidates are advised to refer to the officially announced information by the competent authority.']\n"

The concept of \"grassroots thinking\" innovation SaaS service was proposed in early 2008, when NEEQ SaaS was still in the research and development stage, and positioned itself to serve small and medium-sized enterprises. Compared with its competitors in the industry, Yonyou seems to have started a bit late in the SaaS business operation. Two years ago, enterprises had already announced the launch of SaaS services with great fanfare, and the market was soon flooded with discussions and hype around SaaS. However, to this day, no domestic company has achieved tangible and convincing results in the SaaS business. An expert from Jieli Information provided an interpretation of this emerging market: some products are only oriented to e-commerce, some are concentrated on accounting, and there is a lack of management software products for the SME market, which has 42 million enterprises. Based on this, Yonyou, after conducting sufficient market research in the early stage and developing for a year in the later stage, proposed the customer positioning strategy of \"grassroots thinking\" after a two-year \"silence\". YouDao SaaS locks in entry-level users and serves the most extensive grassroots enterprises. Yang Zhixiong said that most of them were startups with less than 50 employees and annual turnover of less than 10 million yuan, with relatively simple business operations and management. A clear definition of the target market is a testament to Yonyou’s keen insight into the SaaS domain with this innovative concept. Innovation does not necessarily mean being the first in the industry to dare to venture into new fields, proposing more advanced and effective concepts or service forms, which better reflect the core value of innovation. The expert from Ji世咨讯 stated that from the perspective of the industry of software online operation, Yonyou’s accumulation has a competitive advantage, which has made many experts optimistic about Yonyou SaaS. It is not difficult to see the deep consideration that UFIDA has given to its SaaS business operations. On the one hand, almost all SaaS vendors target small and medium-sized enterprises, but pay little attention to grassroots enterprises. Yet, UFIDA found a blue ocean in the fiercely competitive SaaS market, and this field is so large that it can provide strong support for UFIDA\\'s SaaS business. Affected by factors such as service costs and the maturity of demand, small business users with less than 50 employees are often regarded as \"non-economic customers\" by traditional management software vendors and become the \"long tail\" of the management software market. Based on the characteristics and needs of enterprise management, Yonyou segments customers of different scales to achieve the entire life cycle of customer operations, and proposes to meet the management and business needs of start-up small enterprises with SaaS mode, so that Yonyou can comprehensively cover customers of different scales and stages. It is not necessarily beneficial for the development of an industry to only focus on concepts. As a new model, SaaS must demonstrate its advanced technical architecture, innovative service philosophy, more secure and reliable operation and maintenance platform, as well as more advanced application and service support. An industry insider has offered deeper thoughts on the development of SaaS.']\n"

After the \"Matrix\" series ended in 2003, the Wachowskis took a full three years off, during which they only produced V for Vendetta.

      "['曹福达', '正向', \"Fukfu Securities recommends increasing the target price of Cathay Pacific to HKD 18. In 2008, Cathay Pacific suffered huge losses of 8.696 billion yuan, mainly due to large fuel hedging losses caused by the financial tsunami and the subsequent sharp drop in oil prices. The company turned a loss into a profit in 2009, with a net profit of 4.694 billion yuan (earnings per share: 1.19 yuan). Strong earnings rebound attributed to gradual business recovery, effective cost control, significant reversal of fuel hedge losses due to the rebound in fuel prices, and the sale of a stake in Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering (0044.HK, $100.40). The company announced a final and the only dividend of the year, 10 cents per share, which is also the first dividend payment since the company suspended dividends in the second half of 2008 due to the difficult macro-environment. Excluding one-off items, Cathay Pacific’s underlying performance turned from a loss of HK$1.734 billion in 2008 to a profit of HK$852 million in 2009. Cathay’s passenger and cargo revenues fell by 21% and 30% respectively in 2009, causing the company’s revenue to fall by 23% to HK$67 billion, reflecting the decline in the industry. Due to the decrease in the number of first and business class travelers, as well as the pressure on the economy class price, the number of passengers decreased by 2% year-on-year, and the yield decreased by 20%. In terms of cargo business, cargo volume and yield decreased by 7% and 27%, respectively. Total operating costs fell by 34% year-on-year, with fuel and non-fuel costs declining by 63% and 4%, respectively. Due to a 49% decline in fuel procurement costs on an annual basis, and the reversal of 2.8 billion yuan of fuel hedging losses recorded in 2008, fuel accounted for only 28% of total operating expenses in 2009, a sharp decrease of 23 percentage points from the previous year. Cathay Pacific maintains its hedge on future fuel consumption for at least 30% of the next 12 months. The breakeven level for its open fuel hedge contracts is $80 per barrel. After paying 3.2 billion yuan to close out the expired fuel hedging contract in 2009, Cathay Pacific's net debt in 2009 increased by only 4% year-on-year to 26.1 billion yuan, equivalent to a net debt ratio of 62%, a decrease of 7 percentage points from last year, but still above the target level of 50%. Looking to the future, we expect that demand for the company's business will only gradually recover, as some of the decline in demand is structural rather than purely cyclical, and the threat of a rise in fuel prices is another factor affecting the business. Fortunately, despite Cathay Pacific's gloomy outlook, the Hong Kong carrier remains in a better position than its global peers, given its importance as a regional air hub. We continue to recommend an overweight position in the stock, with an adjusted target price of RMB18.00, equivalent to a price-to-book ratio of 1.7x or a price-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiple of 9.7x.

Head coach Van Gundy brought in Pau Gasol and rookie Courtney Lee, and will use Redick and Bogans, two veterans, for a total of four players to experiment with the shooting guard position, and Gasol and Redick are expected to stand out. Petrus is a swingman with decent defense and long-range shooting, all of which are urgently needed by the Magic. Redick has the potential to be a great pitcher, but if his performance is still not stable, he will only be a backup shooting guard again. At 34, Anthony Johnson will be the first backup to point guard Jermel Nelson, who averaged 5.6 points and 3.8 assists last season. Roger Mason, who averaged a career-high 9.1 points per game for the Wizards last season, is a big loss to the bench of the Wizards when he switched to the Spurs. The Wizards\\' main task this summer is to renew contracts with two main players, Allen and Jamison, and their acquisition actions are not large, and the key position to be strengthened is the point guard. With Arenas out, Daniels will start at point guard, with newly acquired Dickson and Dee Brown coming off the bench as the second and third subs. Dickson made 41.7% of his three-point shots last season. The rookie MacKie, who is 2.13 meters tall, will be the key to the team\\'s focus on the interior, and the starting center Hayward once praised him as one of the top three centers in terms of athletic ability in the entire league. The roster of the Eagles was adjusted last season, and there were no significant moves in the summer. Chorhys and Sallim Stoudemire\\'s departure is a huge loss for the backcourt, but Maurice Evans, who can play shooting guard and small forward, is no ordinary player. He contributed a career-high 8.9 points per game last season. He will be the first substitute for small forward Marvin Williams and is expected to become the team\\'s sixth man. Murray is also experienced, having previously played for the Cavaliers and Pistons, and will serve as the primary backup to Joe Johnson, the shooting guard. Morris, who once wore the Knicks uniform as a center, can add to the team\\'s frontcourt strength, and overall, the Hawks\\' strength has not changed much this summer. The Bobcats did not make any changes to their starting lineup. Tiny Boykins chose to join the Bologna team in Italy this summer. Selecting the 9th overall new guard Augustine was the most eye-catching acquisition of the Bobcats this summer. Augustin is a good prospect, but at 1.83 meters, he must take his role as a backup to Ferreira seriously. But Augustine will eventually get more playing time at the one, and may even force Felton to switch to shooting guard. Shannon Brown, the new comer, will be the third substitute shooting guard, who averaged 5.4 points per game last season in the Cavaliers and Bulls. The Heat\\'s second overall pick, Biscley, joining is undoubtedly the biggest help to Wade. Bisley has outstanding physical condition, and if given time, he can surpass Marion and become the second choice of the Heat. The Canadian center, Magloire, who was once an All-Star, will ease the pressure on Brown in the paint. The 34th pick, Chalmers, was found to have marijuana in the rookie orientation class, which led to Bisli being fined $50,000, and Chalmers will be the backup for Banks, the starting point guard. To prevent the point guard position from becoming weaker after \"White Chocolate\" left, the Heat also signed Livingston, but his health is a concern, as he has not participated in an official game since February 2007.']\n"

NYMEX June light sour crude oil futures contract settlement price rose 1.1%, to $99.49 per barrel. On May 20, according to a comprehensive media report, the NYMEX crude oil futures closed higher on May 20, as the oil price was supported by the cover of short positions after the news that al-Qaeda had plotted to hijack or sink oil tankers in 2010. NYMEX June light sweet crude oil futures contract settlement price rose by $1.05 to $99.49 per barrel, up 1.1%, with the contract expiring in 20 days. U.S. officials, citing intelligence gathered from Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan, say that al Qaeda’s goal is to spark a sharp rise in oil prices and trigger a Western economic crisis. But officials added that there were no indications that any specific or imminent terrorist attacks were being planned. Crude oil prices fluctuated during the trading session, falling to a low of $95.99 per barrel due to a stronger dollar and closing positions ahead of the expiry of the June contract, but reversed in the afternoon, reaching a high of $99.89 per barrel. Some analysts said that the large price fluctuations on June 20 may have been due to insufficient liquidity in the June contract and technical pressure. According to the monthly supply and demand report of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the total demand for crude oil and petroleum products in the United States in April increased by 5.2% year-on-year to 19.886 million barrels per day. Traders also believe that long-term crude demand is on the rise, as the US enters its summer driving season and fuel demand increases in emerging markets such as China. Analysts at Purvin&Gertz said that traders saw the decline in oil prices on the 19th as an opportunity to buy, because the geopolitical risks currently cannot be effectively resolved, and there will not be a sharp decline. NYMEX June RBOB gasoline futures settled up 0.98 cents at $2.9358 per gallon, up 0.3%; June heating oil futures settled up 2.36 cents at $2.9183 per gallon, up 0.8%.

This year, the King\\'s Jewelry presents the \"Imperial Secrets, Imperial Treasure鉴赏\" jewelry collection, which reinterprets the unique and noble imperial culture and artistic inspiration of Chinese history in modern high-end jewelry design, reflecting the King\\'s Jewelry\\'s advantage of inheriting and creative enthusiasm for integrating Eastern and Western cultural concepts and showcasing a rich and diverse product style. To showcase King\\'s Jewellery\\'s vision and passion for high-end jewellery, King\\'s Jewellery specially held a VIP appreciation event from October 20 to 22 at the JW Marriott Hotel in Beijing, presenting a magnificent and dazzling visual feast for the deep autumn in the capital. Dr. Fong Shu-ching, chairman of King\\'s Group, and Miss Fong Nows, general manager of King\\'s Group Watch and Jewellery, personally attended the event to enjoy the high-end jewelry show performed by models. A three-day jewelry exhibition, featuring unique and limited edition jewelry pieces. Each piece of jewelry fully embodies the craftsmanship of the King\\'s jewelry, infusing royal grace into the trend, and is both luxurious and fashionable, as well as having inheritable value. This exhibition attracted the attention and favor of wealthy and elegant ladies, business elites, and further established the leading position of King\\'s Jewelry in the industry. In ancient China, the emperors enjoyed the highest status, and the monarchs enjoyed the most honorable and sacred things in the world. As a sovereign or a member of the imperial family, there were imperial auspicious objects and auspicious images for display, to demonstrate the authority and grandeur of the monarch, and the common people could not use them at will in the past. These artistic achievements and rare values of auspicious objects have reached the top of the world. Those passed down to later generations are all regarded as rare treasures and cultural heritage, shining in the long river of history. King\\'s Jewellery took this as the inspiration for creative design, creating a new \"Di Zhen Bao Jian\" precious jewellery diamond series, integrating the style and craftsmanship of modern diamond jewellery, reinterpreting and bringing to life the design concepts of the precious treasures of the emperors in the past, allowing diamond jewellery enthusiasts to share the infinite creativity and noble taste. Each of the products on display in this exhibition is meticulously crafted, imbued with rich Chinese characteristics, exuding an extraordinary aura and an unceasing historical and cultural atmosphere, while also showcasing the royal style of King\\'s Jewelry. The Empress Collar, a product of the exhibition, is based on the honor symbol of the Qing Dynasty – the ceremonial collar. Since traditional Chinese royal attire is a symbol of power, this set of jewelry can fully highlight the identity, status, and wealth of the wearer. The inspiration for \"The Great Wall烈阵长城\" comes from the magnificent historical building, the Great Wall, and is arranged with sparkling white diamonds to form layers. Rows of flawless diamonds simulate the grand Great Wall, and the 3.11-carat diamond pendant is like the Great Wall pass that continues without interruption. The product is as magnificent as the ten thousand cavalry and ten thousand soldiers of the Great Wall, and the beautiful rivers and mountains are right in front of us. The Dragon Eye \"Dragonfly Dragon\" is mainly decorated with dragon patterns. In Chinese culture, dragons symbolize emperors and imperial power. The design element of the dragon\\'s long fangs and claws fully displays the imperial majesty. And the fine craftsmanship and materials of this jewelry set also set a new paradigm for high jewelry. The Empress Lotus Flower, “Lotus After the Empress,” is made of dazzling white diamonds with different cuts, depicting the lotus pattern, and bringing the elegant and refined shape of the lotus on the wall of the Forbidden City in Beijing to life on the jewelry. Moreover, the lotus also symbolizes purity without being tainted by the mud, symbolizing redemption, the most pure and perfect. This appreciation also presented a variety of diamond jewelry, including rare and dazzling yellow diamond jewelry, which shone brightly in the venue, and other high-end jewelry, including diamond jewelry set with jade, pearls, and rubies, which shone with a magnificent and dazzling appearance, making people fall in love at first sight. The high-end jewelry on display inside the venue is worth nearly 1 billion RMB.

Sina Tech News, Beijing time, on the evening of November 3rd, according to foreign media reports today, Best Buy will cooperate with the movie download website CinemaNow to provide digital release services, so that consumers can rent and buy movies more conveniently through broadband connections. CinemaNow has partnerships with major movie studios. Software support for purchasing CinemaNow movies is available at over 1000 Best Buy stores that sell all internet products, which means that users who buy flat-screen TVs, Blu-ray players, PCs and mobile phones from Best Buy can download the video on the day of the DVD release. This collaboration is also the latest development in consumers phasing out DVDs. Consumers are increasingly fond of downloading videos, rather than personally renting DVDs from a DVD rental store or waiting for the DVDs to be mailed to their homes by a DVD rental store. Apple, Amazon and Netflix’s digital release services have been favored by consumers. Blockbuster, a video rental company, is also working with CinemaNow to allow consumers to rent movies over broadband connections. (Zhixiang)']\n"

      "['菅直人', '正向', 'The Japanese government is considering raising the income tax and corporate tax rates to support reconstruction in the earthquake-stricken northeastern region in the next five to ten years, according to a source. The government is considering a plan to increase the income tax and corporate tax rates to support reconstruction in the earthquake-stricken northeastern region by increasing revenue and cutting expenses. On August 16, according to the media, a source said that the Japanese government is considering raising the tax rate of income tax and corporate tax to raise funds for the reconstruction of the northeast region after the earthquake and tsunami. Sources say that the government is considering two options for raising the income tax rate, one is to increase the income tax rate by 5% in the next 10 years, and the other is to increase the income tax rate by 10% in the next 5 years. Both options would generate around 7 trillion yen, or $91.3 billion, in fiscal revenue. By the end of 2010, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced that from April 1, 2011 (the beginning of the fiscal year), the corporate tax rate in Japan would be reduced by 5% to 40% in order to promote exports and boost the domestic economy that was in a weak state. Such a tax cut would reduce Japan’s tax revenues by 1.4 to 2.1 trillion yen annually, or 4% to 5% of fiscal revenues in FY2010. But due to the huge fiscal gap caused by the strong earthquake and tsunami, the Japanese government is considering postponing the above corporate tax reduction plan. The total debt level of Japan has exceeded 200% of its GDP, which can avoid raising funds for post-disaster reconstruction through the issuance of large-scale new government bonds. At the same time, the Japanese government is also considering increasing corporate taxes to generate about 4 trillion yen in fiscal revenue in the next five years to support reconstruction efforts. On July 5, the Japanese government approved a supplementary budget of 2 trillion yen for reconstruction in the northeastern earthquake-stricken areas, including further economic assistance to disaster victims, financial subsidies to local governments, and reserving 800 billion yen for future reconstruction, and plans to further finance through measures such as issuing new debt and selling state assets. The Japanese government expects to take 10 years and spend 23 trillion yen to rebuild the areas devastated by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 311. Only 6 trillion yen has been appropriated in the first and second supplementary budgets, meaning that an additional 13 trillion yen will be needed for reconstruction in the first five years.

According to the Daily Mail, Tottenham has increased its interest in Samba, and Samba\\'s agent will hold transfer talks with two potential buyers, Arsenal and Tottenham, in the near future. It seems that Tottenham not only regard Arsenal as their derby rivals on the pitch, but also want to compete with the Gunners in the transfer market.

Only Garrick, Dawson, Kaboul and Bardsley are centre-backs, in Redknapp’s view, and they are not enough to cope with the demands of the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup, so Old Red turned his attention to Samba. It is reported that the asking price for Samba is 15 million pounds. The Sun reported recently that Samba said he wanted to join Arsenal, but Samba insisted that he never said such a thing.

Many of his friends know that Wang Xiaoshuai, the director, participated in the Cannes Film Festival with his new film \"Suzhou in the Sun\" recently. Although this film did not win an award at Cannes, he heard a very good news during the Cannes period, that his son Wang Tianran won a prize at Carnegie Music Festival in the United States.

Wang Xiaoshuai: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: Sorry to say? Wang Tianran: Thank you to everyone at home. Wang Xiaoshuai: Everything is ready. Wang Tianran: Yes. Zhao Ning, the host: When your son was participating in the competition in the United States at that time, was Wang Director in Cannes at that time? Wang Xiaoshuai: The day Carnegie Hall played that piece of music, it was the 23rd, and it just happened to be the closing day of Cannes on the 23rd. We came back on the 24th, so I was in Cannes on the 23rd. Host Zhao Ning: Did you pay attention to your son\\'s match at the same time? Wang Xiaoshuai: No, he actually won the gold award on the day he performed, and he already knew it. After winning the gold medal, there was a performance. Host Zhao Ning: Then you saw him off in Beijing, waiting for your son to return, and you even waited at the airport for more than three hours, right? Wang Xiaoshuai: We really did get there early, but the plane was a little late. Host Zhao Ning: Well, we can\\'t wait at home anyway, so let\\'s go to the airport. Wang Xiaoshuai: Can\\'t miss the moment when he walks out, he should see the flowers, and feel a sense of achievement. Wang Tianran: Hmm. Host Zhao Ning: Watching dad holding flowers waiting at the customs exit. Wang Tianran: very excited. Host Zhao Ning: He has never expressed to you in this way... Wang Tianran: Never. Host Zhao Ning: This is the first time I bring you flowers. Wang Tianran: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: What did he say at that time? Wang Tianran: said \"Great son, keep working hard\", gave me the flowers, and then my mother took a few photos of me. Host Zhao Ning: I heard that you were pretty cool at the time, saying \"It\\'s nothing\" or something like that? Wang Tianran: No. Wang Tianran won an award and was very happy, but he did not expect that his father would cry with joy. Host Zhao Ning: What was your feeling at that time? Wang Tianran: I\\'m very happy. I can get this award this time. Wang Xiaoshuai: Just say it\\'s fine, it\\'s normal, it\\'s fine, no need to say official words, hmm, it\\'s good, won an award, come again next time, keep working hard. Host Zhao Ning: Have you heard that your father celebrated you for several days? Is there any other way to celebrate after coming back from Beijing? Or buy you a gift to satisfy your long-term wish? Wang Tianran: He gave me a bunch of flowers and took me out for dinner that night, and that was it. Host Zhao Ning: How was that meal? Wang Tianran: It\\'s really delicious, I love it very much. Wang Xiaoshuai: The kinds of food he likes to eat in his daily life. Wang Tianran: congee, vermicelli, etc. Wang Xiaoshuai: He will go to school the next day, and there was no holiday on Children\\'s Day. Zhao Ning, the host: But you know, I heard that when Wang Xiaoshuai, the director, heard the news that his son had won an award in Cannes, he was so happy that he cried. Wang Xiaoshuai: Cry with joy, can\\'t understand? Host Zhao Ning: It was the father who cried, he cried for a long time after hearing that you won the award. Wang Tianran: I have not been told about this matter. Wang Xiaoshuai: Did you not expect that Dad would cry? Wang Tianran: No. Wang Xiaoshuai: No, Dad won\\'t cry in front of you, but he\\'s happy and excited behind your back. Because I received a call at that time. Before leaving for Beijing, Hai Chuan teacher told me this news. Call my mother, call her grandmother, she was really so happy that she cried. Because grandpa just left and didn\\'t see the grandson achieve this result. Teacher Li Haichuan introduced Wang Tianran, the youngest winner of the Carnegie Music Award in New York, to Zhao Ning, the host: Introduce the music teacher Li Haichuan as soon as possible, Li Haichuan teacher should have accompanied Tianran to participate in the competition in the United States. Li Haichuan: This competition has always been accompanied by his mother, because I am a piano teacher at China Conservatory of Music, the teaching workload is very large, very busy, at that time, I also had a struggle in my mind, I think it\\'s still a chance for Tianran to exercise himself, originally should accompany him to go, but because I have my own job, I cannot take leave, so Tianran\\'s mother mainly made a lot of investment in it. Including his regular piano practice, his mother also made a lot of commitments and sacrifices for him. Host Zhao Ning: This music award is called the Carnegie Music Award of New York. Li Haichuan: This is a very high-level competition in China. Everyone sees Tian Ran, a little boy who is only 10 years old, he is the youngest among the winners. There is also an adult group in this competition, and many of the adult group participants are students of piano majors in professional schools around the world. That is to say, he has been in many competitions at the international level, including those that he, who may have participated in major competitions at his age, participated in this competition. Actually, when we sent Tian Ran to participate in this competition, we just had a try, giving him a chance, so that he could see that there is more than what he knows, and try to exercise himself, and to strive for such a learning and observation opportunity. So he got first place at that time, and we were also a bit surprised. Of course, he is very powerful, but this is still inseparable from his own efforts on a daily basis. The competition for this competition was very intense. Host Zhao Ning: Because it is the group of 5-18 years old. Li Haichuan: Yes, and there are a total of 1,700 contestants, from six continents, and contestants from 31 countries around the world, which is announced by the organizing committee of the competition. Host Zhao Ning: From the perspective of a music teacher, do you think the main reason Tian Ran won the first prize is his talent or unique aspects in piano learning?']\n"

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 4 (Reporter Wang Yunjia) The first full-body scanning security equipment in Italy was put into trial use at the Fiumicino Airport in Rome on the 4th. In response to the concerns of opponents that full-body scanners may pose a threat to personal health and privacy, Italian Health Minister Fazio and Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteoli hoped that citizens would not worry when they attended the opening ceremony at Fiumicino Airport on that day. He said, \"Our research has shown that full-body scanners pose no danger to health.\" The head of the Italian Civil Aviation Authority, Rizzo, said that full-body scanners had been designed to meet the need to protect personal privacy, and that the scanning images would be deleted quickly in actual operation. He emphasized that during the next 4 to 6 months of the trial period, passengers would be able to choose whether to undergo a full-body scanner check. It was reported that Italy was originally scheduled to start testing full-body scanners in February this year, but the trial has been delayed until now due to the need for \"comprehensive preparatory work.\" In January this year, Italian Minister of the Interior Maroni said that full-body scanners would be used in three airports in Rome Fiumicino, Milan Malpensa and Venice within three months, focusing on checking \"sensitive\" international flights to the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and other countries. On December 25, 2009, a Nigerian attempted to detonate an explosive device he was carrying on a Delta Airlines flight from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to Detroit, USA, but failed before the plane landed. This attempted attack has sounded the alarm for security in the US and the EU, and many countries have strengthened their aviation security measures. It is reported that the full-body scanner uses a type of electromagnetic wave called millimeter wave, which can \"see through\" the clothes of the person being scanned and accurately display the human body curve and any guns, knives, and explosives carried. Previously, the use of full-body scanners at airports had sparked a heated debate within the EU.']\n"

Report by Fu Yayu in Xianghe today (11). In the morning, the pre-Olympic team left the Xianghe base for Shenyang. At 3 p.m. on December 12, they will play against Liaoning team in the West Stadium, and the Chinese Super League plan promoted by Wei Di will officially begin. This is also the first \"test\" of the new coach Sun Wei. As a member of the former Liaoning team that won ten consecutive championships, Sun Wei, the new head coach of Guoao, made his debut against his old team, Liaoning, and Ma Lin, the head coach of Liaoning, was his good friend back then. Of course, we all hope to win in any competition, but I have said more than once that I will not pay attention to the result of this competition, but there must be requirements for the process, and the competition must have content. Sun Wei told the reporter of the local media on the evening of October 10. Sun Wei said about the special significance of the match: \"I really didn\\'t think about it that much. For us, it\\'s just a regular match. Our task is to improve through the match and further identify our own problems.\" Sun Wei\\'s most well-known experience was when he was a player in Liaoning, and his feelings for his old team were inadvertently revealed, \"I have a very deep affection for Liaoning. I stayed there for 20 years, and the best years of my life were spent there. I have achieved a lot with the team, creating the most glorious history of Liaoning football. I am very proud. I have always been paying attention to Liaoning\\'s football. Liaoning team played very well in the Chinese Super League this year, and I am really happy for them. This time, Sun Wei returned with a taste of returning in glory, and won a victory in front of his hometown elders to prove himself. Of course, this is the best thing to do. And the GuoAo vs. Super League and China League One series is one of the main new policies of the new leadership of the Football Administration Center, led by Wei Di. The first match is against Liaoning. Although Vice President of the General Administration of Sport, Cui Daling, is still uncertain whether he can attend, Wei Di is in South Africa to watch the World Cup and cannot spare the time, but the deputy director of the Football Administration Center, Yu Hongchen, and the director of the National Team Department, Cao Jingwei, will attend the match. It is undoubtedly very beneficial for Sun Wei, who faced doubts from the very beginning of his tenure, to be able to play a beautiful game in front of the leader. Our core goal for this week\\'s training is very clear. Sun Wei said that in terms of defense, the focus of the training this week was to test the improvement in the transition from attack to defense, the selection of personal positions, and the organization of the overall defensive formation. This is the biggest problem in the current team\\'s defense. We have strengthened training this week, of course, we cannot expect to solve the problem completely at once, but I hope to see progress. Sun Wei said. In attack, he emphasized that the national team had set an example for the national under-23 team, pursuing a combination of ground attack, rapid counter-attacks, and possession control. Hope to see the effect of one week\\'s training through the competition, whether there is any change. Will the Guo Ao team have the best state for the match on Saturday? The team has been training intensively in the past week. The players will definitely have some physical reactions, \" said Sun Wei. \"We have a lot of problems to solve, so we can only increase the number of training sessions and make better use of time. The players also felt very tired, but everyone\\'s mental state was very good. \"This is also a test of their willpower. In the long run, we need players with strong willpower. Players need to improve themselves first, which requires a process. We can\\'t keep circling in low-level training. Sun Wei said that the players also fully understood the coach\\'s requirements, and the forward Wang Gang changed his QQ signature to \"fatigue, persistence, improvement, fatigue, persistence, and improvement.\" The training load is very heavy, but Guo Ao will not increase the load at random. Sun Wei told the players at the beginning of the training camp that they should be prepared to endure hardships but not to be afraid, because the coach would scientifically arrange the training. On the day before the departure on June 10, the coaching staff adjusted the training schedule, canceled the morning training, and the afternoon training was also set to focus on the attack and defense of set pieces. The players received some buffer time, and the strength training in the evening continued. The players\\' trunk strength and upper limb strength are very poor, which leads to their weak resistance. Because of lack of strength, they lack confidence when making physical contact, and it is easy to lose their balance and control of the ball, so strength training must be persistent. Sun Wei introduced.']\n"

      "['刘超', '正向', 'White Angel under the Military Flag - A Guide to Enrolling in Chinese Military Medical University Author: Liu Chao This article is excerpted from the blog of the Admissions and Examination Communication Magazine on May 12, 2008. An 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province. At that moment, the sky was dark and the earth was shaking, the mountains were collapsing and the houses were collapsing, and the whole world was in ruins. The Chinese people suffered great hardships. Earthquakes may be merciless, but people are full of compassion. When one place is in trouble, support comes from all directions. The national force for earthquake relief, including 100,000 PLA soldiers, quickly rushed to the disaster area to carry out rescue operations. Under the bright red military flag and in the green camouflage uniforms, there is a group of people who are active. They wear military uniforms and white coats, hold surgical knives or carry medical kits, and run around the clinics in various disaster areas to save lives and treat the injured. Most of these angels in white under the military flags come from four military medical universities. Let\\'s follow their shadows into the Army Medical University and learn about these mysterious universities and majors! Chongqing – Third Military Medical University news link Gu Sichuan as one family. Chongqing, as the largest rear earthquake rescue base for Sichuan disaster area, has always been fighting shoulder to shoulder with Sichuan! Three hours after the Wenchuan earthquake, the Third Military Medical University in Chongqing quickly sent the first medical team to support the disaster area, which was a real rescue vanguard team. The Third Military Medical University sent a total of 7 medical teams to treat more than 3,000 people and safely transfer 1,068 injured people to the rear. In addition, the affiliated hospital of the Third Medical University received 2,000 injured people from the disaster area and made a major contribution to earthquake relief. The specialty of burn medicine is the ace of the Third Military Medical University. Burn medicine is a new and interdisciplinary discipline separated from general surgery, involving biochemistry, pathology, pathophysiology, microbiology, immunology, anatomy, and other aspects.

Enrollment in the clinical medicine program of the Third Military Medical University offers the opportunity to receive international-level burn medicine education. Note: Since 2005, Southwest Medical University, together with Second and Fourth Medical Universities, has recruited non-military students from among the graduating high school students who participated in the unified college entrance examination. The students who are admitted do not have military status during their school years, but they enjoy the relevant benefits provided by the army. After passing the graduation assessment, they will go through the procedures for enlistment and promotion to officer, and then be assigned to work in army units.

The Ming Pao reported that China Metallurgical Group plans to submit an application for listing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the first half of this year, and is expected to list on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges separately in the second half of 2009. CSIC has not yet determined the specific amount of funds to be raised, but if it succeeds, it is estimated to set the record for the largest scale of funds raised by newly listed stocks in Hong Kong since 2008. One of the central enterprises, China Metallurgical Group, mainly engages in overseas engineering contracting, resource development, paper industry, technical equipment manufacturing, and real estate development. It is a key resource enterprise determined by the state, with overseas mine resource investments reaching 1 billion US dollars, and owns iron, copper, gold, nickel, cobalt, lead, zinc, and aluminum production enterprises and mine resources. The group\\'s total revenue for the whole year in 2007 was $17.58 billion, and it ranked 480th in the Fortune Global 500 in 2008. Morgan Stanley is reportedly one of the underwriters for the China Metallurgical Group\\'s H shares. According to the information from the underwriter, the preparation for listing is in operation, but the fundraising scale and listing time are still uncertain due to the recent market fluctuations. But last March, a mainland media report said that CSCEC planned to list in two places in late August 2008, raising a total of 40 billion yuan. But since September last year, CSRC has frozen A-share IPOs, and the listing plan of CSRC has also been temporarily shelved. After the New Year, the A-share index rebounded strongly, and the market spread rumors that the A-share IPO might be reopened, which may provide an opportunity for China Metallurgical to restart its share issuance plan. Market rumors suggest that CSRC plans to list all its businesses except papermaking, but the scale of the fundraising will be significantly reduced. Jinsheng rose 7% on its first day of listing, catching the new issue \"recovery wave\", and successfully raised HK$58 million in its first day of listing, Jinsheng Group (0794), which raised HK$58 million, was not affected by Ruijin (0246), which fell sharply after listing for two days, and closed at HK$1.2, 7.1% higher than the issue price. Without taking into account the handling fee, a small profit of HK$160 can be made for each hand. Chairman Zhuang Jinzhou expressed satisfaction with the stock price performance and said that the paper price is currently relatively stable and is expected to gradually improve. Jinsheng has received shares from Zhang Chengfei, deputy administrative vice president of Jiulong Paper Industry (2689), and Li Wenjun, president of Liwen Paper Industry (2314), for a total of 7.5%. However, neither of them has appeared to support the company since the initial public offering. It was not until the listing ceremony yesterday that Zhang Yuanguo, financial director of Jiulong Paper Industry, and Li Wenjun\\'s brother, Li Wenbin, attended the ceremony to congratulate the company on behalf of their respective companies. When asked whether the strategic shareholders would increase their holdings or have further cooperation, Zhuang Jinzhou did not respond directly, but only said that the two shareholders had a full understanding and confidence in the company, and had a long-term cooperative relationship. As for the new issue of Asia Cassava Resources (0841), which started its share sale yesterday, the initial performance was unremarkable, for example, the turnover of Suning Securities was only 1 million yuan, while that of Phillip Securities was zero.']\n"

      "['冯真,晓敏,陈珊珊', '负向', 'The young man, after chasing after a rich girl and stealing his classmates\\' property while dating, should have been busy applying for a visa and preparing for his overseas studies at this moment. However, he was standing in the courtroom of the Gulou District Court in Nanjing, facing a stern judge and turning his back to his heartbroken parents, undergoing a double trial of law and heart. In order to leave a good impression on his girlfriend as a \"handsome and generous\" person, this \"prospective overseas student\" actually reached out to his classmates and stole more than 20,000 yuan worth of property in just a few dozen days. It is comical that after being caught, he actually thought that returning the items to his classmates would be enough. The Gule Court lawfully sentenced him to three years in prison with four years’ reprieve and a fine of more than 50,000 yuan. Chasing after the beautiful and wealthy Miss Feng Zhen, who is from Henan and is only 20 years old this year. He has always dreamed of studying abroad since he was young, so he came to a preparatory school in Nanjing last year after graduating from high school, intending to study for one year and then go abroad to study for a bachelor\\'s degree directly. It was not an easy decision for his family. Feng Zhen’s parents were both engaged in individual business, with some savings, but not very wealthy. They were very clear that once their son was sent abroad, the prosperous family would face the danger of being “emptied out”. But, which parent doesn\\'t hope their child will succeed, and, for their child\\'s future, grits their teeth and makes up their mind—no matter how hard and tiring it is, they will support their child to continue his studies. Feng Zhen, accompanied by her parents, arrived at a preparatory school in Nanjing in early September 2007, and began her preparatory studies before going abroad. Looking at the expectant eyes of his parents, he repeatedly promised to study hard and pass the English test as soon as possible, and apply to a good school next year. At the beginning of the semester, he was indeed very diligent, and almost studied in the library every night. However, this peaceful life did not last long. At the school reunion in late 2007, he was attracted to a girl named Xiaomin, who was gentle and cute, and dressed fashionably. After that, Feng Zhen began to approach Xiaomin intentionally, sending messages to show his concern and sending flowers to express his feelings, and soon won her over, and became her boyfriend as he wished. The romantic scenery is too expensive. In this preparatory school, there are many students from wealthy families. Compared to others, Feng Zhen is not outstanding in any aspect. Such an ordinary boy managed to catch the attention of the rising star Xiao Min, which amazed many of his classmates and made Feng Zhen very proud of himself. However, a beautiful love is very expensive. Xiao Min comes from a wealthy family, and has been pampered since childhood. Everything she eats, wears, and uses is of high quality, and she pursues romance and atmosphere in her dating. In order to please his girlfriend, Feng Zhen showed himself to be particularly “cool” and “generous,” taking her to high-end restaurants and shopping on weekends, and sending her flowers and gifts all the time. Seeing his girlfriend\\'s delighted reaction to receiving a gift, he felt particularly satisfied and honored. With such high standards for romance, how could his living expenses be enough? He soon spent all the money his parents gave him when they sent him to school. Afterwards, he asked for money several times under the pretense of buying study materials and attending tutoring classes, and his parents always agreed immediately, transferring the money to his card the next day. Feng Zhen spent all this money and felt extremely sad. He knew that his parents had already strained themselves to send him abroad for further studies, and there was no extra money for him to waste. Money is not enough, reaching out to steal classmates\\' love cannot be talked about, and it\\'s not good to talk to parents. What should I do? Feng Zhen thought and thought, and finally reached out to a classmate in the same dormitory building. One day in March 2008, he found that the door of a dormitory was slightly ajar and no one was inside, so he took the opportunity to sneak in and stole an IBM notebook computer from a classmate. After the robbery, he wrapped the computer in a book and sold it at a software store on Jiangzhulou, getting over 1400 yuan. At first, he was too scared to spend the money, as it was stolen, and he felt a little nervous. However, for several days, no one suspected him, and he finally felt at ease, taking his girlfriend out for a good time, and quickly spent all the money. There was a second time after the first, and after a few days, he set his eyes on another classmate\\'s computer and stole it, selling it at the same software store. Success after success made Feng Zhen bolder and bolder, to the point that when he was short of money, he would wander around the dormitories looking for targets and then find an opportunity to steal them and sell them. It was not until a classmate accidentally came across his locker that his theft was discovered. In fact, in just a few dozen days, he had stolen four laptops, a mobile phone, and a game console, with a total value of more than 20,000 yuan. After being discovered, Feng Zhen was quickly taken away by the public security organs. Regarding the theft, he confessed without reservation. When asked why he only stole from dormitories, he replied that he thought the consequences of stealing from classmates were not serious, and that everything would be fine if he returned it after being discovered. It is comical that the legal knowledge of \"potential overseas students\" is so scarce. At the moment when the judge banged the gavel to announce the verdict, Feng Zhen\\'s dream of studying abroad was basically shattered. For the next four years, he will be confined to his home and subject to the supervision of the local public security bureau. However, the expensive love that cost him was unreliable. According to Feng Zhen’s agent lawyer, Xiao Min disappeared after the theft was exposed and did not appear until the day of the trial. Only the parents came to the court and shed tears for him.

      "['勒沃,沃尔科特,博尔顿,富勒姆,赫塔,波鸿', '正向', \"Master's big trend analysis: Le Havre will not lose with low water, and Arsenal is hard to produce a cold. This Saturday's lottery includes the events of four major leagues, with the main focus on the Premier League and Bundesliga. Due to the Champions League and UEFA Cup in the middle of this week and next week, the weekend league cannot be unaffected, but the degree of impact is different, and it may not have a key impact on the course of the game. Arsenal is difficult to produce a cold and steady胆is most looking forward to Arsenal. Arsenal vs Black, regardless of how the current situation of the Champions League is, Arsenal must improve its league position, with only a 3-point gap from Villa, Arsenal cannot give up the league. In the FA Cup match last weekend, Arsenal's reserves beat Burnley easily, and Arsenal completely controlled the game, and the players on the field cooperated well. Walcott, who has been out for four months, is back, and Arsenal is currently short of injuries and can cope with double-line warfare, and it is possible to field a strong team. The average odds for this match are 1.433.957.63. Compared with the odds of the two teams' previous matches, the home win odds of Arsenal only differ by 0.05. Considering that Arsenal has two matches and is in the 16th round of the UEFA Champions League, the average odds are not at all low on Arsenal. In the historical matches, when the home win odds are not much different, the away win and draw odds are much lower than the current ones, indicating that the draw and away win are actually considered more difficult to occur by the bookmakers than before. The bookmaker has reduced the main win, Everton is more likely to be a surprise than Arsenal, Everton is in sixth place, 4 points less than Arsenal, and 6 points more than West Ham, in a difficult position to climb or fall, under such circumstances, Everton should not be a favored side, but the odds do not reflect this. The average odds for this match are 1.493.737.05, while it was 1.503.686.88 just one day ago, the home win was generally reduced, and the initial odds of 1.563.605.40 were adjusted to 1.503.656.20. Although Bet365 did not change the home win, the away win and the draw odds were both increased, from the initial odds of 1.503.607.00 to 1.504.007.50. It is obvious that there has been a significant change before the match, which indicates that Everton vs Stoke should be a major benefit for the home team, and it is worth trusting. Bolton's home game is not unbeatable. Bolton vs. Fulham, both are mid-table teams, both are without desire, so the first intention is suspicious. The two sides of win, draw and lose probably will not pay too much attention. In the case of the Premier League, the outcome of the match is more likely to be influenced by the market. Then analyze the recent situation of both sides, Bolton has won three consecutive home games, including West Ham, which is ranked higher than Fulham. Fulham has not won in three consecutive matches in the league and in the cup, but there is also a draw against Arsenal away from home, which is not to be underestimated. The average odds opened at 2.123.203.31. At the moment, the Asian handicap is around 1.90平/半2.00, which corresponds to the implied odds. Under the above background, Bolton's home field of course gives people more confidence, and the market's reaction is that the upper disk bet will have a very high probability of exceeding the lower disk, and it is difficult for the home team Bolton to win. Leverkusen will bounce back against Hertha. This match is one that I am very confident about. First, look at the background of both sides. Herta has performed better in recent matches. In the last four games, apart from losing to Wolfsburg away, they won the other three games, including defeating Bayern. Leverkusen has not won in the last three league matches, and was held to a draw by Bochum in the last match. Since Leverkusen is not without the chance of qualifying for the Champions League, there is no reason to give up yet, and this match will definitely be fought to the death with Hertha. The average odds are 2.263.232.95, and the home win is slightly too high given the recent form of both teams, and should be in the range of 2.10-2.15. Bet365 offered odds of 2.303.402.75, which was even lower for the home team, and this was not an exception, more than half of the main companies had the home win at 2.30 or above. The Asian handicap is unified at 2.08 draw/quarter 1.82, and the low water of the away team has already shown its attitude. Since the initial opening of the water level, there has been little adjustment, and it is expected that there will be no major changes to the water level before the match. The away team will definitely maintain low water, and the possibility of not losing is very high. Last week, Valencia lost again. At home, the home win was offered at a 1.70 odds, which was clearly too high. It cannot be ruled out that there is a possibility of consecutive cold. Caution is needed for bettors to choose the main bet.\"]\n"

      "['布德-巴格奇,巴格奇', '正向', \"RJ upgraded the stock rating of BedBath & Beyond. Sina Finance News, on the morning of Saturday, a Wall Street analyst announced that the stock rating of the home goods chain BedBath & Beyond Inc. was upgraded, citing that the stock price had suffered serious suppression, and that this stock was likely to rise as the end of the competitors' clearance sales. RaymondJames analyst BuddBugatch pointed out to investors that he has upgraded the stock rating of this retailer headquartered in Union, New Jersey, from “equal-weight” to “outperform”. Bagchi wrote in a research report that the main basis for our judgment was that the stock was severely undervalued and that the Linens'nThings liquidation sale was nearing its end. As investors begin to seek high-quality stocks, BedBath & Beyond is expected to be one of the first stocks to recover. BedBath&Beyond’s stock has fallen by about 30% since September this year, and the stock has suffered even greater selling pressure as Linens'NThings closes its doors. On October 17, Linens'NThings store began to sell off its merchandise at a discount. Bagchi also said that, given the imminent end of Linens'NThings liquidation sales, we expect investors to see a more reasonable pricing environment. The analyst notes that, while in the midst of an economic downturn, BedBath&Beyond’s sales and operating margins are enviable, “the company’s management has the best sales and cost control capabilities of any company we know, although it should be criticized for occasionally failing to communicate with investors.” Before Bagchi upgraded BedBath&Beyond’s rating on Tuesday this week, the company announced that it had lowered its expectations for earnings per share for the third quarter, with a new range of 31 to 35 cents, compared to the original range of 41 to 47 cents. The new forecast is significantly lower than the current consensus expectation of 40 cents per share among Wall Street analysts. BedBath&Beyond noted that comparable-store sales in the third quarter, which measure sales at stores open for at least one year, could fall by 5.6% year over year. As of 2:15 p.m. ET on Friday (3:15 a.m. Saturday Beijing time), the BedBath&Beyond stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose 77 cents to $23.63, up 3.4%.\"]\n"

Thus, in terms of the scope of the examination, the key courses are of course the General Introduction to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Important Thought of the Three Represents. This part has two prominent features: one is its strong practicality, each chapter and the corresponding knowledge points involve in the various main aspects of socialist modernization construction in our country, requiring candidates to analyze and explain a series of major issues, hot phenomena in social, economic and political life, and to recognize and grasp the many major changes and developments in economic base and superstructure that have occurred in our country since the reform and opening up; the other is its strong policy orientation, the understanding and grasp of each chapter and corresponding knowledge points in this part almost all involve in the major guidelines and policies of our Party and government at this stage, the understanding and grasp of these major guidelines and policies is the key to candidates to learn this part well and to be able to link theory with practice in the examination. Based on the above characteristics, candidates should focus on the following aspects when studying the content of \"Deng Xiaoping Theory\": (1) Through review, memorize the basic content of Deng Xiaoping Theory, clarify the basic knowledge and basic concepts, and can cope with the choice questions of this part. Because the questions in this part are mostly intuitive, in general, they are not very difficult, as long as you review comprehensively, you can achieve the standard of judgment. (2) pay special attention to linking theory with practice. Examinees should combine the relevant knowledge points in the examination outline to understand and grasp a series of major issues and hot phenomena that have appeared in our country since the reform and opening up, as well as a series of important measures we have taken in reform, opening up and development. Because of the examination of this part, political postgraduate entrance examination papers often take the form of analytical argumentative questions and subjective questions based on analysis of materials, and the materials given in the questions are often phenomena and problems in our real social, economic and political life. So, during the review and preparation process, candidates should combine the content of each chapter to pay attention to real life, understand the reasons, background, and focal points of major issues and hot phenomena in real life, and consciously cultivate and train their ability to analyze and explain these phenomena and issues with correct theoretical viewpoints. (3) Pay attention to the spirit of the central documents related to each chapter, and study in depth the series of strategic ideas about development proposed by the CPC Central Committee with Hu Jintao as its General Secretary, which are centered on and themed around scientific development. Some new ideas, new thoughts, and new conclusions in the proposals of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixteenth Central Committee on the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" may become the direction, center, and focus of the questions. (4) Attention should be paid to the cross and integration between disciplines. What The Deng Theory expounds on are mostly major issues and hot issues in our current economic, political and social life, and these issues can often be analyzed with the views and principles of The Deng Theory, as well as the views and principles of disciplines such as Political Economy and Philosophy. Therefore, when candidates review the relevant content of Deng\\'s theory, they should pay special attention to the integration and penetration between disciplines, that is, to try to analyze the major practical and hot issues involved in Deng\\'s theory by using the principles of Political Economy and Philosophy in their daily studies. Only in this way can we better answer the subjective questions in the political postgraduate entrance examination paper that require the comprehensive application of multidisciplinary knowledge.']\n"

The most tragic Lang in the swimming field Sina Sports News The grand finale of this competition was held under the \"scene\" of breaking records, and there would certainly be a lot of topics to talk about. Here, we select some of the most interesting \"most\" in the \"part\" to satisfy the readers. The biggest winner, despite losing the 200 freestyle to German rival Bischoff, Phelps did not become a \"normal person\", and five gold medals still established his lofty status as the top swimmer in the world. His huge advantage in the 200 butterfly was beyond the reach of others, and his victory over Kavic in the 100 butterfly was a classic moment, finally putting an end to the controversy of his performance in the event at the Beijing Olympics, and this time the victory was obvious to the naked eye. And in the three relay events, Phelps also contributed, especially in the last event of the championship, the 4x100 medley, where he helped the US team pull away from the other competitors in his specialty, the 100 butterfly. The biggest highlight this time can\\'t be denied was taken by the swimsuit, which stole the show. As Mr. Han said, wearing this suit, everyone can be a torpedo, it is a shame if no one breaks the record and wins the championship. High-tech swimsuits led the International Swimming Federation to make a decision to abolish it from January 1st of next year. And the suit is also very easy to tear. Male athletes can jump without hesitation, even if they are naked, and the camera can capture the arc of the \"heat dissipation groove\" that is very beautiful. Female athletes are much worse. If the final with the smallest gap is to be selected as the most intense competition, there are many choices, but if the smallest gap in the final results is to be selected, it is only the men\\'s 200m breaststroke, where the Hungarian athlete Gyurta quietly launched a sprint in the last 50 meters, catching up with Shanty, who was leading by a large margin, and finally won by a margin of one-hundredth of a second, leaving Shanty, the \"strong man of the swimming world\", helpless! The black horse with the darkest color, although there were many unexpected champions in this competition, but if we talk about the unexpected of the unexpected, it is none other than the German Biedermann. A swimmer who was only 5th in the 200m freestyle and 17th in the 400m freestyle at the Beijing Olympics, he is a power player. He actually broke two world records in this competition, especially in the 200m freestyle, not only defeating Phelps, but also raising the world record of \"Phish\" by nearly one second! Now people finally believe that he set a 200m freestyle world record in the short course at the Beijing Olympics, and it was just to warm up for today\\'s long course record! As to how he could improve his performance so quickly in a year, apart from his hard training, it is also a recognized fact that the help of high-tech clothes has become a reality. The youngest and the oldest in swimming, even an 80s-born, even if born on December 31, 1989, is not a newcomer, the 70s can really retire and be coaches, the 60s, if there are still people, can only sigh at the wonders of the world, but there are still people from the 60s participating, she is the respected mother-level player, Tarra Torres, born on April 15, 1967, an American freestyle player, who won the 8th place in the final of the women\\'s 50m freestyle on the last day. It can be imagined how difficult it is for a 42-year-old player to compete on the stage where a group of young lads are fighting for the last 20 years. Who is the youngest then? It is Goli-Kotcha, who was born on February 4, 1997, from Tanzania, participating in the 100m freestyle event, and the age gap between the two is as much as 30 years! The craziest world record broken in this competition, the athletes broke 31 world records 43 times, and the competition record was not worth mentioning. From the preliminary round, this competition record was as fragile as pottery, and the easiest record to break could only belong to men\\'s 800m freestyle, where Zhang Lin broke the original record by 6.53 seconds! Perkins set the record of 7:46.00 in 1994, and then it took 11 years for Thorpe to break the record twice and for Hackett to set a new record of 7:38.65 in 2005. In that 11 years, the 800m time was shortened by more than 7 seconds, but Zhang Lin achieved this in just 4 years, bringing the human race closer to the 7:30 mark in the 800m event! The most painful men\\'s 50m freestyle final, Brazilian athlete Felipe won the silver medal. Looking at the podiums of other events, European and American athletes, including Chinese and Japanese athletes, could already be considered a good result if they could get a medal, so everyone was very happy, except for Felipe, who was a big exception. He received the silver medal with an unusually painful expression, and then he fell to his knees and cried when he held the flowers, leaving the officials and those around him at a loss. In fact, it is easy to understand. Felipe is the world record holder of this event, and all he thinks about in his mind is the gold medal. The most harmonious scene was in the women\\'s 1500m freestyle, where the Italian athlete Filippi won the championship, of course, the national anthem was played and the national flag was raised. This competition was held in Rome, Italy, and it can be imagined that the blood was boiling at this time. But the machine that played the records broke down, and just as the Italians were singing with great enthusiasm, the national anthem suddenly stopped, and everyone seemed to be playing a flash mob, as if they were frozen in time, and the scene that followed was touching: there was no need to replay the national anthem, all the Italians had a smile on their faces, and looked at each other, and this interlude passed.

He received a call from his brother in the morning, and in the afternoon, the two brothers were separated in life and death. There was no witness, and the driver of the accident did not admit responsibility. The brother posted a message for help: Witness, where are you? Journalist Zhang Yudong verified: A younger brother is undergoing an autopsy at the Second City Hospital. The poster, Wang Shendong, is the deceased\\'s younger brother. He said that the whole family was now at the Second People\\'s Hospital, waiting for the results of the autopsy on his brother. At 5 p.m., we met Wang Shendong, who had red and swollen eyes, and led us to a lawn in front of the hospital. At this time, more than ten people of all ages in the family were sitting on the lawn, hugging and crying. The 3-year-old daughter of the deceased was blinking incessantly in her mother\\'s arms, and she had not yet realized that she would lose her father\\'s love forever. \"I just had a son, and my younger brother called to congratulate me in the morning. I didn\\'t expect it to happen in the afternoon,\" said Wang Shendong. On the afternoon of November 9, he suddenly received a call from his younger brother\\'s colleague, Ge Chuang, who said that Jie Chun was hit by a garbage truck while applying for a driver\\'s license and was beyond help. Afraid that my younger brothers and sisters would think of something, I didn\\'t sleep all night \"I can\\'t even imagine how I told the bad news to my family one by one, and every phone call would be like being stabbed with a needle and a knife.\" Wang Shendong said that his parents were at home, and his mother had hemiplegia. He had always hesitated whether to tell his parents or not, but he still endured the pain to tell the parents in Tanghe, Nanyang, so that they could see his younger brother for the last time. They only arrived in the afternoon, and his mother had fainted three times from crying. On that day, 9th, when the younger brother and sister heard the news, they fainted on the spot. Wang Shendong said that, fearing something would happen, he and his wife took his younger brother’s wife and his daughter Wang Fang, who was over 3 years old, to their home. \"Xiao Jie, Xiao Jie…\" said Wang Shendong. That night, he and his wife did not dare to sleep all night, because his younger brother and sister held Wang Fang and called out the name of the younger brother. Afraid that his younger brother and sister would do something foolish, he and his wife comforted them until dawn. The driver did not admit it, and the relatives were desperately searching for eyewitnesses. \"Just now, the doctor said that my younger brother\\'s left ribs were fractured. Could he have fallen from an electric scooter and be so seriously injured?\" Wang Shendong said that the driver of the accident and the garbage truck have been taken away by the police for handling. The driver surnamed Wei said that his car had no collision marks at all, and he had nothing to do with the accident. Wang Shendong later went to the scene and saw that there were two meters of brake marks behind the garbage truck, \"the speed must have been very fast.\" Wang Shendong said that at the time, his younger brother and three colleagues rode three electric bicycles in a line, not side by side, with his younger brother at the back. At the time of the incident, the two people in front heard a \"bang\" behind them, and his younger brother was already lying on the ground. He did not see whether they were hit or not, so he could not prove the accident. At 5:30 PM yesterday, we arrived at the traffic management office 100 meters to the north of Zhengping Road, which is where Wang Jichun, the deceased, met with an accident. There are restaurants and car washes around, but Wang Shendong\\'s two-meter-long brake marks are no longer there. Look, another garbage truck is coming, how fast! Wang Shendong shouted in anger. Then we visited the shops around. I was eating in the room at that time, and ran out when I heard the sound. I saw a bald man pressing Renzhong acupoint for the person lying on the ground, and the bald man should be the driver. Mr. Wang, a resident nearby, said that at the time, the garbage truck had turned to park obliquely on the west side of the road, and an electric bicycle and a man were lying near the center line. I really don\\'t dare to guess whether he hit or not, after all, I didn\\'t see it with my own eyes. Mr. Wang and several neighbors said in turn. Leave two daughters, the younger of whom is only two years old. My younger brother is more capable than me, and the whole family depends on him. Wang Shendong said that his younger brother had run a freight company for seven years, and the business was very good, earning more than 500 yuan every day. Now there is no younger brother, the freight company has closed down, ah! The good days had not lasted long, what about his two children in the future? Wang Shendong said that his younger brother had two daughters, one was more than 3 years old, and the other was just 2 years old. Then the reporter contacted the police, who said that the accident was under investigation. I hope that those who saw the accident will call us to help our family, we will always remember. Wang Shendong cried.']\n"

Xinhua News Agency, suddenly, there were rumors on the Internet that a killer would kill again on a certain day, and then it was said that the \"murderer\" was arrested after a gun battle between the police and the criminals. These \"sword and saber\" network information have recently made many Changsha people uneasy. Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau announced on February 2 that the police had apprehended a man and a woman who had fabricated \"murder information\" from the source, and imposed administrative detention of 10 days on them respectively. “the murderer challenged the public security bureau” for more than a year, in the suburbs of Changsha, south of Nanjiao Park, south of Furong South Road and east of Second Ring Road, a series of shooting murders have occurred, and the criminals all fled after killing. There was much discussion among all sectors of society in Changsha. Around November 25, posts titled \"Serial Killer No. 28 in Nanxiao Park Will Come Out to Kill\" appeared on some local forums and QQ groups in Changsha. The post said that the murderer in Nanjiao Park had challenged the Public Security Bureau, and that he would come out to kill on the 28th... Our bank has had three plainclothes officers since today. It also reminded citizens not to go out casually or to the bank on the 28th. The post spread like crazy, and some citizens of Changsha were frightened by it. At 16:00 on November 29, another online message claiming to be from the Hunan Provincial Public Security Department and Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau was spread: the suspect who committed the shooting in Changsha was arrested, and before his arrest, he had a fierce gun battle with the police, and it was also said that a police officer was killed in the gun battle. The message originated from a bus, where it was heard that the \"sword and saber\" network messages in Changsha were all fabricated by the police. According to the police report, after investigation, the \"prophecy\" killer who committed another murder was a securities company employee, Yuan Mou (female, 22 years old); and the one who claimed that the \"murderer\" was arrested after the police and criminal shootout was a staff member of a color printing company, Liu Moumou (male, 23 years old). In response to the police’s interrogation, Yuan said that he heard the news on the bus, while Liu explicitly admitted that he had fabricated the news himself. Yuan and Liu spread the information through QQ groups that they were familiar with, which was then passed on to other QQ groups, forums, and websites, eventually causing a social shock. For Yuan and Liu, the Changsha police decided to impose an administrative detention of 10 days on them in accordance with relevant provisions of the Law of the People\\'s Republic of China on Public Security Administration Punishments. Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau stressed that after several恶性 cases, such as the Nanxiao Park shooting, the public security organs have been working hard to investigate the cases and apprehend the suspects, in order to arrest them as soon as possible. Once the suspect is apprehended, he will be disclosed to the public through mainstream media as soon as possible. Changsha police emphasized that the public attention to the shooting and killing case is high, and it is understandable for the citizens and the public to pay attention to it in various ways, but if rumors are manufactured and spread to cause social panic and disrupt normal social order, it is considered a violation of the law, and the police will pursue legal responsibility for the legal responsibility of the false information manufacturers.']\n"

Xingqing moist climate, mountain howling sea, cheering, one thousand and one gold rewards, luxurious and luxurious team. All favorable conditions failed to bring a victory as expected to the Evergrande. And while the Evergrande team was raining down attack after attack, the defense of Guoan, which had been criticized in the previous match, stood firm on this night. Among them, the team captain Xu Yulong, as the backbone of the back defense, deserves the greatest credit. In the pre-match interview, Xu Yulong said that he hoped to use our team to press and restrict the opponent. Indeed, in the whole match, Xu Yulong struggled with the forward player Muriqui of the opposing team in a bloodthirsty manner. In the 32nd minute, Muriqui received the ball in the penalty area and shot powerfully, but Xu Yulong, who dived to block, could not prevent the goal that equalized the score from being scored by the Evergrande. However, this goal loss ignited the passion of the captain of Guoan completely. In the 35th minute, Xu Yulong delivered a long pass to the front field. After the Huangpeng team cleared the ball, they launched a quick counterattack. Xu Yulong fouled Muriqui near the midfield to stop his attack and was shown a yellow card. Although the punishment was not controversial, Xu Yulong expressed dissatisfaction to the referee with his experience. Two minutes later, young player Puskong of Guoan also received a yellow card for fouling Muriqui. Xu Yulong, who was trying to make a fuss for his young teammate, almost provoked Muriqui and caused a conflict. In the 39th minute, Muriqui made an additional action when he faced Yang Zhi who had already got the ball. Just as the Guoan teammates rushed forward to question Muriqui, Xu Yulong played the role of the team captain to comfort his teammates and indicated to the referee that the opponent had committed a foul with malice, which allowed Muriqui to get the deserved yellow card and also brought the game back to the normal track. If Xu Yulong’s first half was described as passionate, the second half was full of fighting spirit. Whether it is the steady header clearance and card position interception in the middle, or the timely defensive support on both sides, it reflects the good condition and rich experience of this veteran. Especially in the 80th minute of the match, Murich dribbled inside the Dalian Sinopac area, almost forming a one-on-one situation. Xu Yulong cleared the danger with a flying backheel, but he was injured in his left foot while clearing the danger. And what followed next made the captain of the security team furious. While the team doctor was examining the injury, the staff who were carrying the stretcher hit Xu Yulong's head with the stretcher to indicate that he should get on the stretcher quickly. This impolite act surprised and infuriated the long-serving captain of the national security team, who hopped on one leg in pain and scolded the stretcher bearers angrily. But the Evergrande striker, Claudio, still went forward to indicate to Xu Yulong that he was faking an injury to delay the game. Finally, Xu Yulong hobbled out of the field with the help of the team doctor for treatment. (Click to watch the video) Despite the great trouble caused by Mulari's super individual ability, it is difficult to conceal the commanding ability, fighting spirit and rich match experience of Xu Yulong, an old team leader, in the match. Even before the preparation period of the season, Xu Yulong adjusted his physical condition, especially his weight, to the best level in recent years through hard training. Recalling the fearless interception of the opponent's one-on-one shot in the first round of the league against Jiangsu, we can see that, despite being over 30, Xu Yulong's leadership position in the Guoan team is still unshakable, especially in the back line without domestic and foreign reinforcements this year, Xu Yulong's existence is particularly precious. While applauding the veteran, we can't help but see the worry: how many more years can Xu Yulong maintain such a state? Who can rely on to defend the country's security when the old captain is no longer up to the task? Looking forward to the quick growth of young players and the addition of high-level domestic and foreign players, so that this former hero of Guoan can one day relax and step out. (Not given)\"]\n"

      "['任思强,王峰,史玉柱,张朝阳,王韬,陈天桥,黄超,陈晓薇,求伯君', '正向', 'World of Warcraft, which has been operating in China for nearly 5 years, will have a shutdown day on June 7, 2009. Game publishers are competing for 5 million players. Every Jing reporter Ren Siqiang, Beijing. Notably, after the World of Warcraft closed all its servers at 7 am on the morning of July 7, at least 5 million World of Warcraft players will be in a state of no games to play for half a month or more – a 15-day battle for the \"World of Warcraft\" players will soon be staged. For the 5 million World of Warcraft players, it is understood that before the shutdown of World of Warcraft on June 7, NetEase has already taken over all the data of World of Warcraft from Netease. On May 31, 9城 announced its first clear statement on the ownership change of World of Warcraft, stating that the service of World of Warcraft operated by 9city will be terminated at 0:00 on June 7, 2009, and the return of player card fees will be launched on June 7. On the same day, NetEase said that all NetEase World of Warcraft servers would adopt new equipment, and both NetEase and Blizzard planned to open the first batch of servers in mid-June, and open all other servers in a few weeks. This means that at least 5 million players of the魔兽 game will be unable to play any games for half a month. Taking advantage of this gap, other online game companies began to launch to capture the market. Recently, Kingsoft announced that the \"Jianxian 3\" (short for \"Jian3\") will launch a \"limit test\" for one million players on June 10, inviting one million players to participate in the test. Players can apply for test qualifications to experience the game starting from June 5. Jinshan\\'s large-scale number release coincides with the data handover of World of Warcraft, and its intention to seize the vacuum period is obvious. Previously, Wang Feng, chairman and CEO of Lan Hong Online, announced the company\\'s strategic layout for 2009, and the three online games under its umbrella, \"Questioning the Apex\", \"Journey to the West\", and \"Mercenary World\", will seize the market share. In addition, Shi Yuzhu, the boss of Giant Interactive, is also looking for a successor for “Triumphant March”, while Zhang Yang of Sohu and Wang Tao, the CEO of Zhihu, are considering the follow-up products of “The Smiling, Proud Wanderer”. Shentianqiao of Shanda has long labeled “Eternal Tower” as the “Korean version of Warcraft”. In fact, Shanda launched Everlasting Tower ahead of schedule to attract World of Warcraft players who have high requirements for game visual effects. And Kingsoft’s Sword Network 3, which will be launched in the second quarter of this year, is also a strong contender for World of Warcraft players. An insider in the online game industry told The Economic Daily News that the 15 days when World of Warcraft disappeared would definitely be the most intense 15 days of competition for other online games. The new round of PK is about to begin, what changes will the transfer of ownership of World of Warcraft bring to the online game industry? Yesterday, Huang Chao, an analyst of Online Game of iView International, said that the transfer of World of Warcraft will not have a great impact on the market environment in the short term, but 2009 is special for the Chinese online game market, which also makes the industry full of uncertain factors. Due to the gap in World of Warcraft in China, 2009 was an opportunity for Chinese online game companies and foreign manufacturers. Apart from Everlasting Tower and Sword Network 3, overseas game manufacturers EA and Blizzard\\'s Starcraft II will also enter the Chinese market. Huang Chao said. Meanwhile, for NetEase, which just signed the \"Minecraft\", the figures on the latest financial report may not be too impressive. At present, NetEase needs to acquire the points cards held by 91 Wireless and compensate for the downtime fees. According to the agreement with Blizzard, a large number of the latest servers need to be built, and the前期 cost is beyond imagination. \"According to Huang Chao,\" Analysts believe that 9 City will enter a transformation period after losing \"World of Warcraft\", which is difficult to recover the previous market share; Shanda may gradually pull away from competitors after launching \"Eternal Tower\"; Tencent will consolidate its current position with \"Dungeon and Fighter\" and several successful products; Due to the official commercial operation of \"World of Warcraft\" by NetEase in the fourth quarter, as well as the stable income of \"The Legend of the Dragon\" (Note: it should be \"Dwelling of the Dragon\", \"The Legend of the Dragon\" is not operated by NetEase), the positions of the top three will not change much. But the analyst said it was hard to predict whether NetEase could overtake Shanda and Tencent with World of Warcraft within the year. The data from the \"2009 Q1 China Internet Market Quarterly Monitoring\" released by Analysys International shows that the revenue scale of China\\'s online game market in the first quarter of 2009 reached 5.514 billion yuan, with a ring growth of 8.3% due to user growth. Last quarter, Sohu’s share of the market fell, and it was replaced by Sohu’s Changyou in fourth place. Huang Chao said that this was mainly due to the delay in the approval of World of Warcraft by 9 City, which led to a decline in the enthusiasm of players to log in, while Sohu\\'s Tianlong Baixue formed a continuous growth in users. The domestic online game landscape has become a situation of constant change. Industry observation: Platformization has become the development trend of online games. Ren Siqiang, a journalist from Jinji, Beijing. After the \"World of Warcraft\"风波dust has settled, NetEase holds several major works such as \"Journey to the West\", \"World of Warcraft\" and \"StarCraft II\", spanning the two verticals of self-developed and agency, and has become the widest online game operation platform. Multi-party analysis also believes that the advantages and years of successful operation experience of portal websites are important reasons for NetEase\\'s victory this time. Platformization is a new trend in the development of online games industry in recent years, which refers to a manufacturer or multiple manufacturers joining together to integrate various resources they own to serve a product. Compared with traditional operating models, platform coordination unifies the forces of all parties, thus forming a powerful synergy to achieve maximum efficiency. At the beginning of 2009, Kingsoft and盛大jointly operated Sword and the World and Sword and the Net 2. After that, Shanda successively signed joint operation agreements with Blue Harbour Online, Qianru Interactive, and Union World. With the rise of this series of joint operations, manufacturers with strong independent research and development capabilities, such as Kingsoft, began to develop into online game R&D platforms, while manufacturers such as Suning shifted to online game operation platforms, and platformization has gradually become mainstream. In fact, this transfer of World of Warcraft also has a strong platform feature. Although the operation platform of 9 City is not comparable to that of NetEase, its plot to act as the agent of Sword and Fairy Online 3 also reveals the idea of relying on Kingsoft\\'s development platform to make up for the loss. As previously reported, Chen Xiaowei, the president of Nine City, visited the Xi Shan Ju development studio in Zhuhai, Kingsoft\\'s location. It is generally believed that the dialogue between Chen Xiaowei and Qiu Baojun, chairman and CEO of Kingsoft, is mainly about the cooperation plan of Sword and Fairy Online III, Kingsoft\\'s heavyweight online game this year. Analysts predict that the aftershocks of the \"Minecraft Storm\" have not yet ended, and online game manufacturers will launch a more intense competition, and the final winner will still depend on the strength of the platform on which each product relies.']\n"

      "['谢旭人', '正向', 'Xie Xuren: We should give more prominence to stabilizing the overall price level. People\\'s Daily Online, Beijing, March 7 (People\\'s Daily Online front-line reporting group) - At 14:30 today, the press conference on \"fiscal policy and related issues\" was held at the press center of the Fourth Session of the Eleventh National People\\'s Congress. Finance Minister Xie Xuren said at the meeting that stabilizing the overall price level should be given a more prominent position. Xie Xuren said that the central government has decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy this year, which is a major decision made by the Chinese government after a comprehensive analysis of the changes in the current domestic and international economic environment. The current world economy, although recovering gradually, is still not solid, and uncertainty and instability still exist. For China\\'s economy to maintain steady and rapid growth, it also needs to address these impacts and requires necessary policy support. Xie said that at the same time, in response to the impact of the international financial crisis in recent years, we have increased public investment, and there are many ongoing projects that still need to be increased in investment. This year is the opening year of the 12th Five-Year Plan. To start the major projects of the 12th Five-Year Plan in an orderly manner, to strengthen the weak links in economic and social development, and to further improve the level of ensuring and improving people’s livelihood, all of these require increased fiscal investment, so it is necessary to continue to implement an active fiscal policy. Xie said that to implement this fiscal policy, we should handle the relationship between maintaining steady and rapid economic growth, adjusting the economic structure, and managing inflation expectations more actively and steadily, and we should also place greater emphasis on stabilizing the overall price level. Xie said that the proportion of the fiscal deficit to GDP would further decline this year, and the fiscal deficit would be reduced by 150 billion yuan compared to last year. The proportion of the national fiscal deficit to GDP last year was 2.5%, and it is expected to further decline to around 2% this year. Meanwhile, in the implementation of fiscal policy, we will focus more on adjusting the economic structure, improving the quality and efficiency of economic development, and making greater efforts to ensure and improve people’s livelihood. In response to the requirement to place greater emphasis on stabilizing the overall price level, we have supported and promoted the production and supply of essential goods for people\\'s livelihood, such as food, cotton, vegetables, sugar, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, in the process of fiscal policy. Further clean up and standardize various charges in the circulation field, and further do a good job in promoting the supply of agricultural production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and films, as well as price management, to promote an increase in supply in these areas.']\n"

      "['娄继英,姜,姜女士,姜×,陈珊珊', '正向', 'A female doctor was dismissed and claimed 2.1 million yuan from her unit after going to Sichuan for disaster relief. After the Wenchuan earthquake, female doctor Lou Jiying from Chongqing went to the disaster area for three days of service, and was dismissed by the hospital as \"voluntary resignation\", which caused a huge response on the Internet. A woman in Nanjing had the same experience as Lou Jiying. She surnames Jiang and is a staff member of the Marketing Department of Sohu Nanjing. Moved by the sight of the disaster area, she went to Sichuan to help in relief efforts without her unit\\'s approval and was fired after her return. Ms. Jiang could not accept the decision to dismiss her. In her view, her act of leaving her post without permission had already been recognized by the unit during the disaster relief period. She had always regarded herself as a volunteer of the unit in the disaster area, and the unit had always promoted her as a positive role model. However, the company did not change its decision for this. She has been fighting for her rights for the past half a year. The reporter learned from yesterday that she has sued her unit for more than 20 million yuan in various compensation and overtime wages. The Nanjing Xuanwu District Court has just accepted this case. Together with three volunteers, she went to the disaster relief. Ms. Jiang originally worked in the market department of Nanjing Sohu. When interviewed by the journalists, she said that after the Wenchuan earthquake, no matter how busy her work was, she would take time to surf the Internet and watch TV to pay attention to the progress of the rescue. But the more I know, the tighter my heart is pulled. The disaster area was in ruins, with scenes of separation and death everywhere. The injured were lying in the rainwater... Looking at this scene, Ms. Jiang could not stop crying. She had a strong desire to go to the disaster area! Do something within your power to help them! On the evening of May 14 last year, she sent a text message to her company\\'s leadership requesting to go to the disaster area, but did not receive permission. I did not sleep all night, and the tragic scenes in the disaster area kept revolving in my mind. Ms. Jiang said that because she was too eager to do so, she had approached her boss twice more, but the boss was still not supportive, saying that she was too busy with work to have time to do volunteer work. Though the negotiation failed, Ms. Jiang was unwilling to give up. On one hand, she made every effort to arrange the work at hand, and on the other hand, she communicated her idea of volunteering in the disaster area to several customers, and received their active response. At 5:00 p.m. on May 17, she resolutely boarded a plane with three other volunteers to reach the disaster area. After the company had been “promoting” the disaster-stricken areas, Ms. Jiang and her companions immediately threw themselves into the rescue work. On May 19, Ms. Jiang contacted the Nanjing side immediately to urgently mobilize a batch of tents, as the disaster area was short of tents. On May 20, she helped a developer contact the donation and construction of a Hope Primary School. They ran around Dujiangyan, Shifang, Wenchuan, and Yingzhou, and did a lot of work in the heavily affected areas. I always consider myself a volunteer of Sohu House, and I am participating in the disaster relief on behalf of the company. Ms. Jiang said that she kept in close contact with her company during her time in the disaster area, and sent back a large number of text messages, photos, and DV short films. These lively materials appeared in the company’s reports on the website. Now, Miss Jiang has printed out these reports as evidence and had them notarized. Yesterday, at the court, the reporters saw that in the article \"Emergency Mobilization Order for the Disaster Area\" on the website on May 18, 2008, the first paragraph began with the following: \"A team of four volunteers, organized by Nanjing Sohu, arrived in Chengdu by plane at 5 p.m. on the afternoon of the 17th.\" The volunteer team included Nanjing Sohu Qiang × × ×, and the term \"Sohu volunteer\" and \"the only female member Qiang × ×\" also appeared in other reports. Seeing the company refer to me in this way in the report, a stone was lifted from my heart. Ms. Jiang believed that the company’s promotion of her as a positive role model for disaster relief was an indication that the company recognized her volunteer work in the disaster area. She received a notice of termination as soon as she returned, but Ms. Jiang never expected that she would be called to a talk by her boss as soon as she arrived at the workplace on the morning of May 28. Her boss blamed her for leaving her post without prior notice and said that she was no longer welcome to return to work. Several days later, she received a notice of termination. Disaster relief cannot be used as an excuse for violating company regulations. One of the company’s officials said that from a moral standpoint, it was commendable for Miss Jiang to go to the disaster area as a volunteer, but as a company employee, she had not obtained approval before leaving, and her leader had not signed to agree, which was a serious violation of labor discipline. According to the company\\'s rules and regulations, three days of absence will be regarded as voluntary resignation. Ms. Jiang has been absent for seven days, which is a serious situation. It is reasonable to terminate the labor contract. The employees believe that disaster relief is a job-related act, and Miss Jiang cannot accept the unit\\'s decision to terminate her employment. She believed that the reports on the unit’s website had already recognized her volunteer team as a branch of the Sohu Volunteer Team, and recognized her as a Sohu volunteer. At the same time, it adopted the pictures and text she sent from the front line of disaster relief, which meant that her work in the disaster area was a job-related act. Therefore, the employer has no factual or legal basis to terminate the labor relationship with her on the grounds of absenteeism. Even if we do not talk about the law, but from the perspective of emotion, what the company did is not convincing. Ms. Jiang believes that, as a volunteer for the company in the disaster area, she actually brought positive effects to the company. The journalist called Nanjing Sohu house network in the afternoon of the day before yesterday. A person in charge of the company said that they would present evidence in the trial to refute Miss Jiang\\'s view. She sued the company for over 2.1 million yuan in compensation in June last year, when Jiang requested the Nanjing Xuanwu District Labor Arbitration Committee to arbitrate and asked the company to continue to fulfill the labor contract. Later, she applied in writing for the termination of the arbitration when the arbitration hearing period had expired, and filed a lawsuit with the Xuanwu District Court of Nanjing in early March this year. This time, she no longer asked the company to continue to fulfill the labor contract, but instead proposed huge compensation, including 834,000 yuan for illegal termination of the labor contract, 417,000 yuan for economic compensation for termination of the labor contract, and more than 200,000 yuan for additional compensation. And demand that the unit pay a total of more than 740,000 yuan in unpaid wages, business commissions, and overtime pay, etc. Chen Shanshan']\n"

Film fans who have seen the film \"Orphan of Zhao\" must remember the touching scene of Zhao\\'s family being wiped out and the loyal giant Lingjie protecting his master. In the siege of archers, the giant\\'s eyes were full of despair, but he still used his last strength to protect his master with his flesh and blood. Ling Zhe also became a \"super tough guy\" in the hearts of movie fans. After the release of \"Orphan of Zhao\", Daxing\\'s popularity soared, and the number of film offers also increased. Yesterday, the reporters learned that Daqing, a city, has been favored by the famous American director Quentin Tarantino and will star in the movie \"Iron Fist\". Daqing excitedly introduced, \"I played a gangster in it.\" The reporter learned that Daqing was a shot putter and weighed more than 300 pounds. When Daqing entered the set of \"Orphan of Zhao\" to shoot the first scene, \"loyalty to the master\", he ran with the props car wearing heavy armor in high temperature, and his leg was seriously injured. He only rested for two or three hours and continued to shoot, showing his \"manly\" nature. Quick reporter Shen Mei']\n"

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 10, 2008: Bush\\'s Olympic Record: Smiling, applause for the American \"Dream Eight\" Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Fangcan Ignoring the obstruction of a few people, President Bush, who came to Beijing to watch the Olympics from afar, enjoyed this Olympic journey with his family and savored the delicious Olympic meal. On the evening of October 10, he watched the men\\'s basketball match between China and the United States at Wukesong Basketball Hall. During the competition, he cheered for the American athletes with great enthusiasm. After attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games and watching the performance with great enthusiasm, Bush has been seen in the beach volleyball court, the Water Cube and Wukesong Basketball Hall in the past two days. He is taking full advantage of his limited stay to watch as much of the exciting Olympic Games as possible and cheer on the American athletes. Bush is the cheerleading captain of the US Olympic delegation, and has performed very well so far. He expressed the greatest support to the athletes of the American team at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. On the morning of the ninth, he came to Chaoyang Park to visit the US beach volleyball team that was preparing for the competition. He, who is enthusiastic about participating, took part in the game himself, and exchanged skills with the spicy beauties, and hugged them for a group photo. On that day, he also visited the players of the US softball team. Bush brought encouragement and good luck to the US team. With his on-site support, swimming star Phelps won the first gold medal for the US team at the Beijing Olympics and broke the world record. After watching the US women\\'s basketball team play on the 9th, Bush came to Wukesong Basketball Arena again on the 10th. At the beginning of last month, when Bush was attending the G8 summit in Japan, he asked President Hu Jintao of China for tickets to this match. This match ticket is one of the hottest tickets of this Olympic Games, Bush finally got this long-desired ticket. The game started at 10:15 p.m., and Bush arrived at the stadium early. Along with him were his wife Laura, his father, former US President George H. W. Bush, his mother, and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. They were warmly welcomed by the audience and the US team players. Bush is wearing a blue shirt and looks very casual. The game started, and China scored two three-point goals in a row with Sun Yue and Yao Ming, taking the lead in the score over the United States. This also made Bush look gloomy and embarrassed, with his chin in his hand, speechless. The American aide beside him tried to communicate with him, and he shrugged and waved his hands helplessly, looking helpless. The US team then seized the opportunity to take the lead 7-6, and Bush\\'s gloomy face finally cleared up, his face turned sunny, and he clapped his hands with a smile, whispering to his family. But the Chinese team soon took the lead again. Although everyone around was clapping, Bush had a gloomy face and was very nervous. The US team then went on a 7-0 run to tie the score. Bush\\'s excitement was hard to contain. After that, the two sides were in a stalemate, and Bush leaned back in the seat to relax his tense mood. In the second half, the US team was ahead by nine points, but the Chinese team tied the score under Yao Ming\\'s leadership. Bush leaned forward, extending half his body, staring intently at the game on the field, more nervous than anyone else. Seeing the US team score three consecutive times, Bush, who had finally calmed down, turned around to talk to Yang Jiechi for a while, pointing at the field and giving instructions, as if he was very familiar with the game. But China’s counterattack was also effective, and US officials accompanying Bush applauded for Yi Mingming, who remained motionless. With seven minutes left in the second quarter, James drove to the basket, Bush raised his hand high above his head to cheer for the US team. Then the US team launched a beautiful offensive and increased their lead by more than ten points. Bush was a little more at ease, crossed his legs, and relaxed. At the end of the first half, the US team was leading 49-37, and the parched Bush finally remembered to drink. He was drinking water while watching the lion dance, which had a Chinese folk flavor, being performed on the field. He was engrossed in it and asked the Chinese counterparts questions now and then. In the second half, the Chinese team\\'s defense was terrible, and the American team even put on a slam dunk show. Bush was very happy, nodding from time to time and smiling with a sense of achievement. With six minutes and 54 seconds left in the final quarter, the USA was leading China by 34 points, 84-50. Seeing that the victory was certain, Bush and his family left their seats and left early, satisfied. As he walked down from the stands, he waved to the US team members and the Chinese audience on the spot, who responded with applause.']\n"

      "['赵老师,阳光,赵团', '正向', 'Leading the way in college promotion, Nanjing University\\'s undergraduate admission Weibo was renamed to \"Nanjing University\" from \"Zhaoli\\'s Weibo\" on the Sina Education News. At 8:00 PM on the 16th, the renaming of Nanjing University\\'s undergraduate admission Weibo immediately caused a strong response on the Internet. The number of fans increased by nearly 200 people in less than two hours, and the number of related comments exceeded 150. The Weibo post was also forwarded multiple times. Old fans expressed their intention to continue to pay attention to the development of their alma mater, Nanjing University, and to contribute to the expansion of Nanjing University\\'s fame. New fans, after finding Nanjing University, expressed their joy and were moved by the fact that their alma mater, Nanjing University, had adopted such an \"up-to-date\" and \"cute\" way to showcase itself. Weibo, a microblog, is a newly emerging web2.0 manifestation, a kind of system similar to a blog with extremely fast interaction and dissemination. Its biggest feature is integration and openness. You can post messages to your microblog via mobile phone, IM software (gtalk, MSN, QQ, Skype) and external API interfaces. Due to the convenient organization and arrangement of language, as well as the convenience of updating, it has been quickly and widely accepted by people. According to the first China Weibo Developers Conference held recently, the number of Sina Weibo users has exceeded 50 million, and it is still growing explosively with an average of 10 million new users per month, and the proportion of Weibo from mobile terminals is as high as 38%. Our school soon realized the potential of this emerging media and became the first official Admissions Office Weibo to register and get certified on Sina Weibo. According to the person in charge of the Student Affairs Office, Sina Weibo began public testing in late August 2009, and our school registered in February 2010 and went online officially on May 7. Up to now, the number of candidates and alumni who have paid attention to us has approached 9,000, ranking third in the number of universities that have set up microblogs in the country; the number of times the blog has been forwarded, commented, and received private messages is close to 4,000, and the popularity is the highest among the admission offices of various universities. Media once highly praised the humanistic care of our school’s microblog with the title “Nanjing University Beats Peking University in Zhao Teacher’s Microblog”. On June 7, Nanjing University was also recommended as the first in the Sina.com \"Collective Opening of Microblogs by University Admissions Offices\" campaign. “Zhaosheng Teacher’s Weibo” is taken from the meaning of “Admissions Teacher’s Weibo” and is expected to become a virtual spokesperson for the Admissions Office on the Internet. At the beginning of its launch, it coincided with the period of independent recruitment and the subsequent recruitment publicity, and the promotional methods of fans \"reposting\" and the convenient means of mobile terminal access played an active role. Many fans also offered advice on the recruitment work of Nan Da through comments and private messages, some of which were implemented quickly and had a positive effect. Fan \"Sunshine\" once told the reporter that he had commented or sent a private message to other universities\\' Weibo accounts, but had not received a response. NUDT was the only one to reply to his admissions office\\'s Weibo account. \"Mr. Zhao\" sounds like a conversation with a person. The fans also jokingly call themselves \"Zhao Tuan\". The head of the Student Affairs Office explained that with the development of the Admissions Office’s microblog, its functions were expanding, and the need for more people to pay attention to it to enhance its promotional effect was becoming urgent. These groups should not only be limited to candidates, but also include alumni and even friends of Nanjing University who are concerned about its development. Rename the Admissions Office\\'s Weibo account to \"Nanjing University\" for easier search and recognition. Many fans have also suggested renaming it on this point many times. In addition, on the day that our school\\'s enrollment microblog changed its name, Sina Education launched a large-scale promotion activity for \"China\\'s University Microblog\", and \"Nanjing University\" was listed on the microblog list. On the 18th, Nanjing University innovatively launched the \"Action\" (i.e. blog reposting action) on its microblog, and on the 19th, it launched a text live broadcast of the \"2011 High-level University Cooperation for Independent Enrollment Signing Ceremony\". This attracted great attention from media outlets such as Sina, and it topped the first piece of information on Sina Education. (From Nanjing University News Network)']\n"

On the evening of May 20, the second-tier team Duisburg officially announced that it signed German player Jürgen Gassula, who played for FSV Frankfurt in the second tier this season, for two years. This 26-year-old player\\'s contract with the team will expire this summer, so Duisburg can get him for free. Gashula, who plays as a central midfielder, has dual German and Albanian citizenship, and in the new season, he will be a teammate and strong competitor for Chinese player Jia Yi in the attacking midfielder position of the team. Gashua made 32 appearances for the club in the 2019-2020 2.Bundesliga season, scoring 6 goals and providing 7 assists. After obtaining him, the club\\'s coach Sasic said on the official website: \"Gassula is a fast midfielder, he has a good vision, a high passing accuracy and good dribbling skills.\" And Bruno Huber, the club\\'s sports director, revealed that \"Gassula had the opportunity to play in the Bundesliga, but it was the club\\'s philosophy that ultimately convinced him to join Duisburg, where he will be able to show his potential.\" Gassola also became the second attacking midfielder that Duisburg signed in the summer, with Jia Yi, who was signed before, although played as a right winger most of the time in Hohentübingen, actually played as a central playmaker, with his attacking focus in the middle. Two players will both cooperate and compete for the attacking midfielder position in the new season, but for Jia Yi, who is already over 30, competition is already a matter of course. Although Duisburg did not give Jia Yi any promise of a starting position, it is believed that he will bring more surprises to the team with his full preparation. (Aaritalo)']\n"

After the Dalian City Intermediate People's Court of Liaoning Province accepted the case, it publicly tried the case at 10:30 a.m. on July 26, 2011 in the sixth criminal trial hall of the court. Some representatives, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, media reporters and relatives and friends of the parties and citizens attended the trial. The court did not announce the verdict in court. The Dalian People's Procuratorate of Liaoning Province charged that on about 11:30 a.m. on May 1, 2011, when defendant Han Fangyi was driving a white Toyota car with the license plate number of Liaoning B89G99, he got into a quarrel and beat Fu Jianwei, a traffic assistant, at the intersection of Malan North Street and Fumin Road in Ganjingzi District, Dalian, because he did not obey Fu Jianwei's traffic command. Then Han Fanyi called his father, defendant Han Jiamin, to inform him that he was beaten, and Han Jiamin then called defendant Zhou Shengqiang to arrive at the scene. Han Jiamin and Zhou Shengqiang arrived at the scene in succession. Han Fangyi immediately pointed out Fu Jianwei to the two defendants. Zhou Shengqiang then went forward to beat Fu Jianwei. At this time, when Dalian Public Security Bureau Traffic Police Brigade Shahekou Detachment Order Squadron officer Shi Yingcai was handling the situation on the scene, he saw the situation and pulled Fu Jianwei behind him and asked Zhou Shengqiang why he was beating someone. Zhou Shengqiang threatened and insulted Shi Yingcai and hit him in the face and head, knocking off Shi Yingcai's police cap on the ground. Han Fangyi went forward to hug Shi Yingcai and pushed him back. Zhou Shengqiang continued to hit Shi Yingcai with his fists, knees, and feet. Han Fangyi threw Shi Yingcai to the ground with a back throw and continued to hug him, causing Shi Yingcai to die from acute coronary heart disease due to external force. The prosecution believes that the defendants Han Fangyi, Han Jiamin, and Zhou Shengqiang intentionally injured others, resulting in one death, and their actions have violated Article 234 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, and they should be held criminally responsible for the crime of intentional injury. Defendants Han Fangyi, Han Jiamin, and Zhou Shengqiang committed a joint crime and should be punished in accordance with Article 25 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.

Another report shows that the unemployment rate in the EU reached 10.1% in September, the highest since July 1998. Crude oil prices have risen by 9.2% over the past two months, and the strong euro has dampened exports, reducing the funds available to businesses and consumers.

      "['丁晓磊,孙弘,李亮,张树略,孙弘认,刘俊', '正向', 'MasaMaso: Men\\'s Wear Online|Reporter Ding Xiaolei of the magazine \"We are a clothing company.\" Mr. Sun Hong, the general manager of MasaMaso, a subsidiary of Beijing Jiuhexiangping Technology Co., Ltd., repeatedly emphasized. Many companies that do clothing business online prefer to call themselves IT companies, and talk about how network tools have made product prices so low that they are unbelievable. Sun Hongzhe is obsessed with running a simple clothing company. Customers will buy cheap clothes through various channels, but they will not give up their requirements for product quality and design. MasaMaso does not only play tricks on prices, but also grasp the essence of clothing. Sun Hong said. In the past two years, the story of PPG, a pioneer in direct online shirt sales, making a fortune every day, has inspired many famous clothing companies and internet people to try their luck in the direct online clothing sales business. The low-price bundling strategy of PPG has become a common practice in the industry, with products priced at mid-low levels, \"68 yuan per piece\", \"29 yuan for three pieces or more\", and consumers feeling that \"even if the product is not good, buying once will not lose much.\" This kind of sales approach once enabled PPG to ship more than 10,000 pieces per day. This prosperity is based on low cost, low quality, and high advertising investment, but it is difficult to sustain. In late 2008, rumors spread that Li Liang, the founder of PPG, had fled with the money, and the online clothing direct sales industry was shrouded in darkness. MasaMaso gradually brightened in the night. Since its official operation in August 2008, the company has reached a break-even point, even with a slight profit, processing thousands of orders per month, with the average order value increasing from 157 yuan to 500 yuan, and it has accumulated more than 20,000 registered users (almost all of whom have made purchases). Since the inception of MasaMaso, Sun Hong has always placed great emphasis on the experience accumulation of team members in traditional industries. He believes that doing business must first grasp the essence of the industry, and whether it is e-commerce or retail sales, it is just a form. More than half of MasaMaso’s employees come from the traditional clothing industry, which contrasts sharply with PPG and Fanke. In fact, Sun Hong himself is a veteran in the clothing industry, with more than ten years of work experience. He once served as a senior executive of Zhejiang Kailai Co., Ltd., CLEARLUCERNE, and Beijing Weiduo Garment Center, and has rich resources in design and procurement. His business partner, Zhang Shuli, used to be a senior executive of Shenzhen Webex Technology (a well-known SP in China, acquired by Sina in 2004), and is now the deputy general manager of MasaMaso, in charge of data mining and analysis and internet marketing. MasaMaso\\'s goal is: the same quality, the lowest price; the same price, the best quality. They regard the control of the quality of clothing as the top priority. Sun Zhen believes that there are two factors that determine the quality of a piece of clothing: one is the quality of the fabric, and the other is the level of processing. In terms of fabric selection, apart from a small part of the fabrics purchased overseas, MasaMaso mainly uses high-quality fabrics from Yagor and Lutai in Shandong. In terms of production, Sun Hong mobilized resources to find not only the original factories that processed for Weikodo, but also the top shirt factories such as溢达in Hong Kong to produce shirts for him. Although our current volume is small, these processing plants are willing to produce for us based on our previous relationships. Their technology is high, and the rate of defective products is extremely low, which provides quality assurance for us. Employees of MasaMaso track and monitor each process from sample making, production, and inspection, and inspect each piece of clothing individually when receiving the goods. Quality control makes MasaMaso’s operating costs and product prices much higher than those of its competitors. For a shirt, MasaMaso is priced between 200 and 400 yuan, while Fanke is around 200 yuan. But compared to traditional clothing companies, MasaMaso has a clear price advantage. Take the \"Modal\" underwear, which is the best-selling product in MasaMaso, for example. The price of this product is over 260 yuan in brands such as Dior and CK, over 200 yuan in British Farfetch, but only 49.5 yuan in MasaMaso. We don\\'t pursue how cheap it is, we just need it to be a little cheaper than buying the same quality product online. Sun Hong said, \"We will not enter the mall, reduce store investment, and through direct sales, greatly reduce the cost of circulation.\" Compared with traditional clothing companies, MasaMaso earns the channel fees. Clothing store design is as important as quality. Sun Hong invited a Spanish designer to design clothing for his brand, and emulated the practices of the third-ranked global clothing retailer, the famous Spanish clothing brand ZARA, by having the designer frequently shuttle between various fashion shows or enter various fashionable places to design some clothing similar to the latest products of top brands, thus ensuring that MasaMaso stays on the cutting edge of fashion. But, Sun Hong truly admired ZARA’s supply chain management philosophy and level. Our volume is still small, and our control over processing plants is limited, so we are not yet able to emulate the ZARA model, but we can make market forecasts based on sales data. \"Zhang Shuli said.\" Currently, MasaMaso\\'s sales forecast accuracy for the next month has reached over 90% on average, and the production-sales ratio can be controlled within 80%~90%. Of course, doing direct online sales must make use of the unique advantage of the Internet – data analysis. This analysis not only helps businesses interpret consumer purchasing behavior, but also provides consumers with a better shopping experience. Just as Amazon recommends different books to different users, MasaMaso uses this technology to recommend clothing. Some people like to wear hoodies, while others prefer to wear shirts. Everyone has their own preference. We will recommend new fashion apparel based on their past purchasing habits. \"Zhang Shuli said.\" In addition, this analysis can also recommend clothing combinations based on customer purchase data, so that male friends who are not good at dressing can buy clothes at home. However, this technology is not a one-time achievement, but is based on the construction of computer platforms and the accumulation of large-scale consumer data. According to Mr. Jun Liu, the former vice president of Zhenwuwang, Amazon has over a hundred servers and several mathematicians in the United States to do one thing, which is data mining and analysis. It is clear that the role of data analysis in e-commerce is powerful.']\n"

The US non-farm employment decreased by 663,000 in March, while the market expected a decrease of 640,000, and the previous value was a decrease of 651,000. According to Bloomberg\\'s survey, economists expect the number of non-farm jobs in the United States in March to decline by 660,000, for the 15th consecutive month. However, the employment market data released earlier was weak, and the number of non-farm employment in March is expected to fall by more than 700,000. Meanwhile, the US unemployment rate could rise to 8.5%, the highest since 1983. Tip: The Non-Farm Payroll Index in the United States reflects the development and growth of the manufacturing and service industries. A decrease in the number indicates that companies are reducing production and the economy is entering a recession. A large increase in the number indicates a healthy economic situation. Theoretically, this should be beneficial for exchange rates and may indicate higher interest rates, which would be beneficial to the US dollar. If the non-farm employment index increases, it reflects an increase in economic development, and vice versa. The non-farm employment index is usually considered the most synchronized and accurate indicator of economic operation, and the statistical results of the previous month are released on the first Friday of each month. Employment reports are often hailed as the \"jewel in the crown\" of all economic indicators that the foreign exchange market can react to, and they are the most sensitive monthly economic indicators in the market, from which investors can usually see a lot of market-sensitive information.']\n"

      "['邓宁宁,杨刚', '正向', \"Be cautious when buying on the strength of vegetable oils in a high position. Shanghai Zhongqi Deng Ningning. Editor Yang Gang. The concern about the reduction of international agricultural crops is still there. Under the influence of the upward breakthrough trend of US soybeans, BMD, and crude oil, domestic vegetable oils continued to rise and strengthened this week. The author believes that it is cautious to chase the high prices of oils in the short term, but the speculative short selling space at the high level is limited due to the support of the fundamental situation of oils, and the stop-loss points should be set properly. On the international market, with the overall macroeconomic environment maintained stable, July and August are the key growing periods for soybeans, and the uncertainty of weather factors has supported soybeans to soar from 900 cents. The rise in wheat has a positive spillover effect, which then drives soybeans to break through the 1000-point mark and continue to rise. For the January shipment of US soybeans purchased from domestic sources, the profit value is still around 100-150 yuan per ton based on the price of the 1101 contract of the futures market. In addition, the La Nina phenomenon delayed the increase in palm oil production and the moderate increase in Malaysian palm oil exports in July, pushing the BMD benchmark up to around 2600 points in October. Compared with the foreign market, domestic vegetable oils still have a small space for catch-up, but need further improvement in the external market and fundamentals. Due to the high import of oilseed in June and July, the supply and inventory pressure is still there. So, during the early stage of this wave of vegetable oil futures price increase since July, the spot market was always in a state of waiting and watching. By late July, the vegetable oil market had improved slowly with strong support from the overseas market and fundamentals, with the spot prices of vegetable oils rising by about 300 yuan per ton since late July. In addition, although soybean oil is under pressure from ample domestic soybean supply, the uncertainty of weather factors during the key growth period of soybeans in China and the United States in August still supported the soybean varieties at a high level. Second, China's multiple trade negotiations with Argentina have failed, and the policy of restricting the import of soybean oil continues to be enforced. So, the subsequent oil mill pressing capacity may be increased, and it is also expected that the market will still be in a state of selling oil and buying meal before the traditional soybean meal inventory peak in September and October. The soybean oil price is thus well supported. At the beginning of the week, the transaction and position of rapeseed oil increased significantly, which pushed the price of 1101 to break through the resistance level of 8500 points and reached a new high of 8630 points in 2009/10, which had a strong driving effect on soybean oil and palm oil. From the spot market, rapeseed prices are high and supplies are tight due to farmers'惜售. In addition to increasing the purchase of rapeseed within the scope allowed by policy, oilseed processors also actively participate in the purchase of rapeseed oil in the futures market. Recent international rape seed reduction hype has pushed up import costs, and manufacturers prefer to buy delivery rapeseed oil for packaging and other processing. From the position of rapeseed 1009, the state reserve position of Wanda Futures, which is relatively heavy, has more than 10,000 hands of short positions, which is relatively stable. Currently, the price of rapeseed oil 1009 is around 8,400 yuan per ton. Compared with the cost of national reserve rapeseed oil at 8,500 yuan per ton and the spot rapeseed oil at 8,600-8,700 yuan per ton, the futures price is still expected to rise further. The main 1101 long position can continue to hold for the long term and can be seen up to 9000 points. In summary, under the macro environment of maintaining stability, the fundamentals of vegetable oils have slowly improved, while the futures prices have significantly strengthened. Technically, oils are still in an upward channel. But after a recent sharp rise, there is a need for a consolidation at high levels for most commodities. And with the demand gradually completed by the Double Festival inventory buildup, caution is needed for buying at higher prices in the future. However, the speculative buying demand from traders still exists, and the fundamentals still provide support for the high and volatile oscillation of oils. So, the speculative high opening short position has limited space, set the stop-loss point. Technically, there is a need for consolidation of rapeseed oil 1101 in the range of 7800-7900 points, and long positions should be reduced and held after a push to 7900 points. In addition, the soybean oil 1101 is gradually moving to the distant month, and soybean oil 1105, after consolidation at 8000 points, is expected to break through 8100 points. Palm oil 1101 long positions can continue to hold with light positions, with resistance at 7078 points and support at 6800 points. Rapeseed oil 1101 long positions can continue to hold, and the medium and long-term focus is on the 9000 point level. Short-term rebound support at 8400 points.\"]\n"

Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said that the Prime Minister's office received a letter that was suspected to contain bullets on that day, and immediately handed the unopened letter to the police. The police confirmed that the letter did contain a bullet after scanning it with X-rays. In addition, the police found a note in an envelope that read “dead”. The Tokyo police said that the office of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan's secretary-general, Seiichi Nakasone, also received a threatening letter containing bullets on the same day. At around 5:30 pm on that day, Kōzō Kōno, a secretary of Seiichi Nakasone, found a threatening letter containing a bullet in Nishinomiya and reported it to the police. In addition to the bullets, a card was also attached to the letter, which the police said asked Kōzō Kōzuki to resign. It is not yet clear who sent these threatening letters.

After the鸠山 government took office in September last year, letters containing bullets criticizing Katsuya Okada were received at Okada’s office and residence, the headquarters of the Democratic Party, and the Asahi TV in Japan.

The curtain of the Chinese Super League has fallen, and Chongqing and Changsha have been relegated, which also casts a shadow on their prospects. After Jin De was relegated, a journalist asked on the spot whether they would continue to play football. At that time, the club\\'s management did not give a clear answer. Today, it was reported that Kingde Group will withdraw from the football circle, and Changsha Kingde will also disband. However, Vice President Zong Jie of Jin De told the reporter that they had not yet determined whether to withdraw, and Jin De players also said they were unaware. After moving its home ground to Changsha, Jin De\\'s performance has always been unsatisfactory, and there is no good fan market in Changsha. The team\\'s poor performance has also failed to arouse the interest of local fans. This year, Xiangtuo in Hunan Province successfully promoted to the first division, which filled the gap of professional football in Hunan Province, and Xiangtuo also received the support of the leadership of Hunan Sports Bureau, making Jin De\\'s position more awkward. Under these circumstances, Golden again suffered relegation and would inevitably lose more market share. It was not surprising that news of King\\'s impending dissolution also emerged. According to the reporters, the Golden Field club has not yet decided whether to withdraw, and even if it withdraws, the form of withdrawal has not yet been determined. Zong Jie, the deputy general manager, told the reporters that everything is still not decided, and the news of the definite dissolution is a lie. Afterwards, the reporters contacted several players of Jin De by phone, and they all said that they were not aware of it now. However, the Golden Lion players also revealed that the club has not clearly specified the time of the next concentration. Notably, the captain of Jin De, active national football player Wang Qiang, updated his Sina Weibo today (http://t.sina.com.cn), and also revealed a little of the sadness of farewell. Wang Qiang said on Weibo, \"Go with the flow.\" Then he tweeted, \"Where will I play next year?\" It revealed a mood of parting. In the latest microblog post, Wang Qiang said directly: \"Seeing my teammates leave one by one, I have an indescribable feeling of sadness in my heart, perhaps this separation may not meet again for a long time.\" I hope that my teammates will have a good future, especially the children who have just joined the team.

      "['', '正向', 'CSRC Approved SPGE to Launch Wire Rod and Rebar Futures Trading to implement the important strategic deployment of the Several Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on the Current Financial Work to Promote the Economic Development, the CSRC recently approved SPGE to launch wire rod and rebar futures trading. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Regulations on Futures Trading Administration and the Measures for the Administration of Futures Exchanges, the CSRC will approve the listing of the futures contracts of the SSE as soon as all the preparatory work is completed and the relevant procedures are fulfilled. Steel is an important industrial raw material, known as the \"skeleton\" of industry. The steel industry is an important pillar industry of the national economy, and an important symbol of the level of national economic and social development and comprehensive national strength. In 1996, China\\'s steel production exceeded 100 million tons for the first time, becoming the world\\'s largest steel producer, and has since remained at the top of the world. In 2007, China\\'s steel production was 489 million tons, accounting for 36.4% of the global total, surpassing the total of the second to eighth largest steel producing countries. And, since 2006, China has become the world’s largest steel exporter, exporting 62.64 million tons in 2007, and holding an important position in the international market. In 1993, China\\'s steel prices were fully liberalized, and prices were determined entirely by the market. Steel prices have fluctuated greatly and market risks have been more obvious all along. Steel production, trading and consumption enterprises lack authoritative price signals to guide production and operations, and they are also unable to hedge against the risks of price fluctuations. During the recent international financial crisis, related industry enterprises have played a positive role in responding to the risk of price fluctuations by using futures transactions of non-ferrous metals such as copper and aluminum. The demand of steel spot enterprises to use the futures market of steel to discover prices and hedge has become increasingly strong. To conduct futures trading in steel, first, it is conducive to forming a market system that organically combines steel spot and futures, standardizing and improving the steel circulation market; second, it gradually optimizes the mechanism for forming steel prices, guiding steel upstream and downstream enterprises to reasonably arrange production and operation, helping government departments to timely and accurately grasp the trend of market changes, take early regulatory measures, and ensure the rational allocation of resources and the supply and demand balance of the market; third, it provides steel production, trade, and consumption enterprises with low-cost and high-efficiency risk control means, improving the management level of enterprises, enhancing market competitiveness, and promoting the steady development of the steel industry; fourth, by registering brands, attracting and encouraging leading steel enterprises with advanced technology and environmental protection standards to register their products as delivery varieties, promoting the healthy and orderly development of the steel industry, and earnestly implementing the \"Steel Industry Development Policy\"; fifth, relying on the advantage of being a major steel exporting country, enhancing China\\'s pricing influence in steel trade, and improving the international competitiveness of China\\'s steel industry. In short, through the establishment of the steel futures trading market, its economic functions will gradually be brought into play to provide services for the growth of national economy. Steel is classified in a variety of ways, with complex specifications and a wide range of varieties. After careful study and in-depth research, and based on the actual situation of the spot market and the technical requirements for the design of futures contracts, it is reasonable to use wire rods and rebar as the trading objects for steel futures contracts. Currently, the SSE has completed the preliminary design of the futures contract for rebar and wire rod, determined the general and widely circulated contract subject, formulated relatively strict trading, settlement and delivery systems, and argued for risk control measures such as tiered margin system, daily price limit system, and position limit system. Under the premise that the market risks are controllable, measurable and bearable, the CSRC will approve the listing of steel futures contracts on the SSE as soon as possible in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, and guide and urge the SSE to do a good job in cultivating steel futures according to the market development situation, and gradually improve the variety system of steel futures. Relevant reports: The draft contract is exposed, the steel futures are advancing, the steel futures have fired the first shot of product innovation, the steel futures have knocked on the steel stock market, the steel stocks have closed up to welcome the new steel futures, the launch of steel futures has promoted the market-oriented process of steel enterprises, and the launch of steel futures has a profound impact on the steel industry. Domestic and foreign steel futures materials are introduced, and the history of steel futures is reviewed.']\n"

Sina Sports News, on April 23, the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Oklahoma Thunder 96-101 away, and the two teams\\' total score was tied 2-1. Kobe Bryant scored 24 points and made 8 assists, but Kevin Durant scored 29 points and grabbed 19 rebounds, and Russell Westbrook added 27 points, leading the Thunder to their first playoff victory since moving to Oklahoma City. And for Kobe, the bitter taste of defeat was to be savored alone. From the perspective of the Lakers\\' history, this was a night that needed to be remembered, as Kobe rose to become the fifth-highest scorer in NBA playoff history, and the Lakers\\' all-time playoff scoring leader was officially passed from Jerry West to Kobe. But such a milestone moment ended with a humiliating defeat, which the Fly Guy may not want to recall. The Lakers led for three quarters, but were overturned by the inexperienced Thunder in the final quarter. Not only did Kobe fail to play the role of savior, but he also became an important reason for the loss. In the latter part of the fourth quarter, the Lakers were on the brink of defeat, and Kobe wanted to come out and save the team, but he lost the victory because of his reckless play. It is not an exaggeration to say that it was Kobe himself who ruined the coronation ceremony of the Lakers\\' all-time playoff points leader. It is ironic that all of Kobe’s four recent milestone moments ended with the team losing. To become the youngest player in history to score 25,000 points, the Lakers lost to the Cavaliers and were swept in the regular season; to become the Lakers\\' all-time regular season scoring champion, the Lakers lost 93-95 to an average Grizzlies team; to surpass Reggie Miller\\'s total points, the Lakers lost to the Mavericks; today, to become the Lakers\\' all-time playoff scoring champion, the Lakers lost to the Thunder. Perhaps it was heaven\\'s jealousy of talent, and Kobe was like a special \"curse\", always unable to win in milestone moments. If this happens again and again, we can find a reason for it. They lost 25,000 points to the Cavaliers, and Kobe made 31 shots, of which 15 were made in the second half; in the game where he surpassed West, Kobe made 28 shots; in the game where he surpassed Miller, Kobe\\'s shooting was the least of these games, but he still reached 23 times, and in the fourth quarter, he did almost nothing; today, Kobe made 29 shots, of which he threw 11 three-pointers. Four milestone games, Kobe averaged nearly 28 shots per game. It is not difficult to see from these figures that Kobe was inclined to go it alone in these milestone games, with his shot attempts significantly exceeding the average for the season, which also became an unavoidable factor in the team’s losses. Everyone knows that Kobe\\'s competitiveness is rare in the league, and his forever pursuit of perfection is indeed a double-edged sword, which can hurt the team if not used properly. As some people have commented, sometimes when watching Kobe\\'s games, he often has \"difficulties to be overcome, and difficulties to be created if there are none, to be overcome\", and the savior plot occupies too much of his heart. Like today\\'s fourth quarter, it often lost its cool in such critical moments. It is necessary to mention again the topic of \"excess\": Kobe and Jordan. There are too many similarities between the two, and it is also difficult to find someone in the league who is closer to Jordan than Flyin. But the closest does not mean that Kobe has really surpassed or equaled the former flying man. The basketball realm of the Lakers\\' core is indeed high, but its court mentality is still difficult to compare with Jordan. The same level of desire for victory, but Jordan\\'s ball handling ability is much more calm and reasonable than Kobe in most cases. There is almost no case of sacrificing the team for the sake of self-love in the playoffs. If Kobe could also improve this to Jordan\\'s level, he would truly have the qualifications to compare with Jordan. (vincent)']\n"

Due to the signs of slowing US economy and the Fed's lack of intention to launch QE3, the US stock market continued to fall slightly. The Hang Seng Index opened slightly lower in the morning, broke through the annual line, and then expanded the decline. But the closing was significantly narrowed as real estate stocks pulled up quickly. Bank stocks continue to be weak. Except for China Minsheng Bank (01988.HK), which rose 1.53% against the trend, all other domestic banks fell, with ICBC, ABC, and Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank all falling more than 2%. Hong Kong banking stocks performed slightly better, with Standard Chartered and HSBC rising slightly. International crude oil futures prices have risen, and the NDRC has stated that a new mechanism for setting the prices of refined oil products may be introduced this year, which may delegate pricing authority to the three major oil companies, stimulating the petrochemical sector. China National Shale Gas and China National Chemical rose by 2.91%, while China National Offshore Oil and China National Petroleum Corporation saw a slight increase. Airline stocks were under significant pressure, with China Southern Airlines falling 4.75%, and China Eastern Airlines and Air China both down more than 2%. Global economic slowdown and concerns over tightening liquidity have been the main factors behind the weak market in recent days.

Clean handwriting and smooth language 10 points for self-assessment of illegal behavior 30 points for clear corrective measures 30 points for understanding the consequences of illegal behavior \"I have realized my mistake and will definitely correct it in the future.\" Don\\'t think that what you see is a student\\'s self-criticism. This is the \"check\" of a driver who is breaking the law. Traffic police adopt such an educational approach, with a dedicated scoring system. If one passes, they can be exempted from the penalty of detention. The traffic police said that the move was more for educational purposes. -Xing Jun, a reporter from the Commercial Journal, and Li Dongya, a reporter from the local public security bureau, found seven illegal vehicles in half an hour. At around 10:00 am yesterday, the traffic police of the Third Detachment of Zhengzhou City were carrying out traffic rectification activities in the Huanggangsi area of Zhengmi Road. This connects to the entrance of the Zhengshi Expressway, where large trucks and long-distance coaches often gather, and the pick-up and drop-off of passengers by coaches also attracts many motorized tricycles for soliciting passengers, making the Zhengmi Road, which was already busy, even less smooth. The police officers were directing traffic and checking for illegal vehicles at the intersection. Half an hour later, the police seized the vehicles of seven drivers, four of whom were driving without a license, one of whom was driving without a driver\\'s license, one of whom was driving in the wrong direction, and one of whom was driving with goods but not closing the rear door. Then, the seven drivers were taken to the traffic police Detachment 3, Chunhui Road Accident Parking Lot for handling. The accident car should attend a warning class first, according to Zheng Minjun, a traffic police officer, according to the traffic law, driving without a license will be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 1,500 yuan. If this standard is applied, five people will face severe punishment. But in fact, the traffic police did not deal with them in a simple way of fines and detention, but focused on criticism and education. Inside the accident parking lot, police officer Zheng Minjun led seven people to the side of a wrecked accident car and told them that on November 21, a Dongfeng truck on Zhengmi Road illegally overtook from the right front and collided with a BYD F3 sedan, which was torn in half, and the driver of the sedan died on the spot. And the truck driver also paid a heavy price for his actions. Many accidents are caused by our illegal driving, and this is a very painful lesson in front of us. Zheng Minjun said. After passing the test to exempt from detention, the police officer gave each person a piece of paper to write a \"story\" of the accident, divided into four parts. Moreover, the traffic police also read out the scoring criteria, with a passing score of 60 points, and passing would exempt them from detention. The scoring criteria are as follows: the first part is clean handwriting and fluent language, 10 points; the second part is to characterize one\\'s own illegal behavior, which should be comprehensive and accurate, 30 points; the third part is to take measures to correct the behavior, which should be clear in thought, 30 points; the fourth part is the consequences of illegal behavior, which should be recognized in place, 30 points. My name is Hu Tingjie. I was checked by the traffic police on the morning of April 4. I don\\'t have a driver\\'s license and I violated the law. I will definitely learn from this experience and drive safely in the future. This is a segment of the \"story\" written by Hu Tingjie, who wrote very attentively after graduating from elementary school. Say whatever you want, I am really wrong, I will definitely change in the future. The driver Su Jianguo said. Actually, the scoring is just a formality, and the main thing is to see how they behave. As a management approach for traffic police, drivers with a good attitude of admitting mistakes can be punished less or not at all. Traffic police Zheng Minjun said, and this is equivalent to a guarantee, if they are caught by traffic police again, they will be dealt with according to the law.']\n"

      "['瀚民,郭勇斌', '正向', \"Hanmin Watch: Although the funds entered the market selectively last week, why is it difficult for the adjustment to be significantly expanded after the market's upward push was blocked? Answer: In the first half of this year, the market showed a pattern of falling, consolidating, and then falling again. Everyone was looking forward to a rebound, but consolidation was a rebound; it is worth noting whether consolidation can replace a large correction after the market turned around in early July. Generally speaking, in a market atmosphere dominated by veteran shareholders, consolidation is equivalent to adjustment. So, the current market is unlikely to experience a sharp adjustment. On Monday morning, it seems that there are new buyers entering the market. Can we see that there is more capital flowing in? The answer is that the rise in the index must be caused by the intervention of funds. But, compared with two weeks ago, the market is now selectively entering, which is completely different from the situation in the previous period. What kind of stocks do off-exchange funds choose to enter? Answer: In the past two weeks, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, as well as food and beverages, are places where capital injection is more obvious. In addition, the Shanghai reorganization stocks were active on Monday, indicating that the reorganization theme is also a main line of capital intervention in the recent period. Overall, inflation and restructuring will probably be the focus of our attention for some time to come. What is the trend in the medium-term market? The answer is that the trend turned around at the beginning of July, and after a brief forced push, it has been repaired and adjusted in the recent period. Due to the large number of profit-taking positions that have accumulated in the short-term market, it is estimated that the consolidation process will be relatively long and it is unlikely to see a squeeze again. If that is the case, while maintaining a firm confidence in market trends, we should be prudent from an operational perspective. Stick to the principle of buying at low prices for the stocks you are interested in. Guo Yongbin(Han Min) has received _COUNT_comments. I want to comment.\"]\n"

It is reported that after the MOU was signed, ChinaBond will provide money market fund transaction data to CSRC, so that CSRC can monitor the abnormal operations of money market funds in real time, and thus regulate them in a timely manner. In fact, since the second half of 2008, the scale of money market funds has expanded rapidly. In response, the CSRC issued a risk warning on November 17, prohibiting fund companies from engaging in irregular operations such as \"long-term bonds short-term operations\" and \"hiding bonds\", and eliminating the practice of片面追求收益率 and fund scale. According to Tianxiang data statistics, the proportion of money market funds in the net value of all funds rose from 3.39% at the end of 2008 to 20.63%. While the prices in the stock market are mainly determined through public bidding, the prices of trading products in the money market are more likely to be influenced by human factors. The monitoring system launched by CSRC in cooperation with ChinaBond may solve the above problems. Under the new system, if the trading price between both parties deviates significantly from the price range determined by the long-term yield curve, it will be included in the warning scope, and both parties of the trading product and the transfer path will be monitored. The CSRC will punish the violation of rules to different degrees once such behavior is discovered.']\n"

Daniel Hoffman, chief technology officer of the mobile security company SMobile Systems, said that if the iPad uses the same encryption method as the iPhone, sensitive personal data, including phone numbers and email addresses, would be stolen and viewed. Hoffman said that the iPhone security encryption issue is basically worthless. This encryption measure is easy to bypass. Second, if iPad users obtain their own applications from the Apple App Store, they are at risk of occasionally getting malware. He pointed out that malicious software has always existed in the Apple App Store. Hoffman said that, in addition, the iPad would be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, like other devices that use insecure WiFi networks. SMobile is developing a tool to defend against this attack. In this attack, the attacker is able to intercept Internet communications sent by a mobile device over a WiFi network, and inject new information into the communications by masquerading as a legitimate party. He said that the iPad still has management capability issues, such as the choice of using a PIN or password code, and the remote lock and delete functions once lost or stolen. iPhone provides the ability to locate a lost phone and remotely delete data, but this service is very expensive, charging $100 per year.

There is a saying in the investment circle, \"In the 1980s, we looked at the Pearl River Delta, in the 1990s, we looked at the Yangtze River Delta, and in the 21st century, we looked at the Bohai Rim Economic Circle.\" There is no doubt that the Bohai Economic Rim, as the third growth pole of China\\'s economy, has matured the concept of urban agglomeration and economic circle after learning from the experience and lessons of the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta, and has become the most rapid, standardized and international core of economic development in China. During the magnificent development process of the Bohai Rim Economic Circle, with the opening of the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, the long-planned \"Beijing-Tianjin Integration\" has become a reality, which has promoted the rapid development of various industries in Beijing and Tianjin, attracting the world\\'s top resources to gather here, making it the core with the greatest potential for development in China. And the birth of the \"New Jingjin\" also prompted many astute real estate tycoons to move north, and a real estate development battle was held grandly in the \"New Jingjin\" area, where they \"walked and fenced\" the land. As the ancients said: A good chess player plans the situation, while a bad chess player plans the pieces. Financial Street Holding Group is undoubtedly a powerful real estate developer, because while other real estate developers in Beijing and Tianjin are adopting the traditional \"buy land and build houses\" development strategy, Financial Street Holding Group, as the most urban operation concept and commercial real estate development experience in China, has relied on its rich experience in commercial real estate development to create a new business landmark in the city center of Tianjin, the \"North China\\'s first high-rise\" Jin Ta, and created two landmark business flagship projects, Financial Street Xidan Square (Forum Photos Floor Plans Model Rooms Reviews Map Search) in the most business atmosphere of Xidan business district in Beijing, achieving the magnificent momentum of \"twins shining\" in the Bohai Rim Economic Circle, and thus playing a grand commercial real estate development \"double city record\". As the tallest building in North China, JinTang Tower, with a height of 336.9 meters, was officially capped on January 14, 2010, ranking 25th among the world\\'s tallest buildings that have been completed. Jinta office building is well-rounded, whether in the design of the building structure system or the application of facilities and equipment, it adopts international leading technology. Although JinTa was not expected to be occupied until 2011, it has already attracted more than 50 Fortune 500 companies to come for negotiations and prepare to choose this location. Following Jinza\\'s impressive market success, Jincheng Group aimed at the Xidan business district in Beijing, carefully crafting another business landmark - Jincheng Xidan Plaza, to continue the new business development legend. Unparalleled geographical advantages are the core value of the financial street Xidan Plaza, which leads the business real estate market in Beijing. It is south of the \"first street of China\" Chang\\'an Street, east of the national political center Zhongnanhai, and west of the financial center of Beijing, the financial street, gathering all the excellent resources of Beijing, enjoying world-class mature facilities, and laying the foundation for the first-class business office atmosphere. Meanwhile, the financial street Xidan Plaza is surrounded by the main urban traffic arteries such as Chang\\'an Avenue and the West Second Ring Road, and is adjacent to Xidan Metro Line 1 and Lingjing Hutong Station of Line 4, which has formed a rapid and convenient three-dimensional traffic network system, which can quickly connect the city\\'s major core business districts and is conducive to the smooth conduct of business activities. In addition, the pursuit of excellence in architectural quality is another key factor that enables the Financial Street Xidan Plaza to stand out in the fiercely competitive business market in Beijing. West单 Plaza in Financial Street specially sets up a 10-meter-high independent lobby and independent entrance and exit, creating a pure business atmosphere for the入驻 enterprises to enjoy the hustle and bustle of West单 while commuting. At the same time, it creates an aerial ecological landscape leisure space in the office building to the world-class standard, ushering in a new trend of green ecological office. And the standard floor with an area of 7,700 square meters is characterized by a square layout, flexible and practical space, and high utilization rate, which meets the different office needs of different strength enterprises and achieves a new experience of top-level business office. In addition, the West单广场 itself is equipped with nearly 50,000 square meters of commercial facilities, which will be planned as a luxurious shopping center and conference center, providing a bustling and convenient business support for the enterprises that enter. The exceptional quality of the West Chang\\'an Square in the Financial Street has made it as famous as the Jin Ta, the tallest building in North China, which is still under construction. Currently, dozens of strong enterprises are eager to buy the Financial Street Xidan Plaza as their office location, and the booming market prospects can be seen from this.

At the beginning of the 09 outdoor season, good news came from the domestic athletics circle. At the All-China Athletics Championships and the provincial games men\\'s preliminary held in Yulin, Guangxi, Cao Shuo, a 17-year-old young man from Hebei, jumped 17.13 meters, breaking the world record of the age group. Cao Shuo\\'s emergence has added a touch of confidence to the domestic athletics circle, which has been holding on to the \"beard record\" of 28 years set by veteran Zou Zhenxian. If you look at the national records of Chinese athletics, Zou Zhenxian\\'s 17.34 meters in men\\'s triple jump is the longest in terms of time among all the records. In the 1981 World Athletics Championships, Zou Zhenxian won a precious silver medal with a performance of 17.34 meters, which was only 3 centimeters less than that of the champion, Brazilian star Oliveira, and ranked second on the annual ranking list. Actually, Zou Zhenxian\\'s actual long jump was not 17.34 meters, but around 17.50 meters. Unfortunately, due to his nylon shorts with wide pant legs, his body had not yet landed when the pant legs lightly brushed against the sand pit, causing the score to drop by more than 10 centimeters. Why is Zou Zhenxian\\'s shorts not fitting? Originally, the World Athletics Championships were not participated in the name of the country, but in the name of the continents. At that time, the Asian team jersey that Zou Zhenxian was wearing was not provided by the domestic, so there was a deviation in the size of the jersey and pants. 1981 was the peak period of Zou Zhenxian, who broke the Asian record twice in 17.32 and 17.34 meters that year, and won the championship of the World University Games with the former. As he grew older, Zou Zhixian rarely jumped over 17 meters in the following years. He himself never expected that \"17.34\" would sleep for more than a quarter of a century on the national record list. In the late 1980s, the emergence of two newcomers, Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin, brought Chinese men\\'s triple jump to another peak. The 11th Asian Games in Beijing in 1990, Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin jointly staged the most spectacular competition in the history of Asian triple jump, Zou Sixin jumped 17.31 meters, which was the best Asian performance in nearly nine years, only three centimeters away from Zou Zhenxian\\'s record. However, this achievement still did not make him the champion, as Chen Yanping jumped an astonishing 17.51 meters. Unfortunately, Chen Yanping’s jump was disqualified for exceeding the 2 meters per second international standard for wind speed when he completed it. Although this result allowed him to taste the gold medal of the Asian Games, it could not be recorded in the Asian record. After several years, with Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin entering their prime, the overall level of the Chinese triple jump declined significantly. In the 1990s, only Zeng Lizhi jumped close to Zou Zhenxian\\'s record of 17.30 meters. Zou Zhenxian was inevitably anxious to see his own scores unchanged on the national record sheet. In 1997, the \"Zou Zhenxian Triple Jump Record Challenge\" was born, and this competition has been held for nine sessions so far. Although it is called a challenge, the champions of the first seven competitions have not exceeded 17 meters. In the past two years, the situation has clearly improved. At the 8th Challenge held in 2007, Zhong Minwei, a young player from Shandong, won the championship with 17.27 meters at the age of 20, creating the best domestic performance in the past 12 years. Another runner-up, Wu Bo from Hunan, also broke the 17-meter barrier. Wu Bo won the 9th championship last year with a result of 17.02 meters. In fact, there are many other excellent players in China in recent years beyond Zhong Minwei and Wu Bo. In the 2001 9th Games, Wu Ji from Hebei team won the championship with a result of 17.04 meters, which was the first time that Chinese athletes had broken the 17 meters barrier after many years. Since 2004, a batch of young players in their early twenties have emerged in China, who have successively broken through the 17-meter barrier: in May 2004, Li Yanxi, a player from Hebei, achieved a performance of 17.09 meters in the National Games and the Olympic selection competition, becoming the first 80s player to enter the 17-meter barrier in China. Four months later, Gu Junjie, a new star from Sichuan, jumped 17.23 meters in the national championship; in the 05 season, Li Yanxi improved his personal best to 17.15 meters; in 2006, although Li Yanxi did not create his personal best, he jumped over 17 meters three times in the whole year, showing his outstanding strength. In this year, Zhejiang athlete Zhu Shujing, with a performance of 17.03 meters, became a member of the \"17-meter club\"; in the 07 season, it was an exciting year, with four people breaking the 17-meter barrier, including Zhong Minwei, Gu Junjie, Wu Bo and Zhu Shujing. Among them, Zhong Minwei\\'s performance of 17.27 meters was the 15th in the world, equivalent to the 5th place in the Athens Olympic Games, which was a relatively rare achievement for Chinese men\\'s triple jump athletes in the past 10 years. Currently, there are five current players in China who have achieved a personal best of more than 17 meters, which is unprecedented. However, Chinese players generally have the weakness of large fluctuations in their level, which to some extent restricts their normal performance of technical level. For example, Gu Junjie jumped 17.23 meters in 2004, and his best result in the 2005 season was only 16.44 meters, a difference of nearly 80 centimeters. Gu Junjie\\'s performance at the Beijing Olympics was disappointing, with a result of only 15.94 meters; similarly, the young athlete Zhong Minwei, who was a pleasant surprise in 2007, has not broken the 17-meter barrier for nearly two years, and his best result at the Beijing Olympics was only 15.59 meters. Among the team, Li Yanxi is known for his technique and has the most stable results. From 2004 to 2008, he jumped over the 17-meter mark in four seasons. Even this technically skilled player showed a lack of technical stability at the Beijing Olympics. In the preliminary round, Li Yanxi jumped 17.30 meters, which was one of the best performances in China after 1990, and ranked third among all athletes in the Olympic preliminary stage. On the final two days of the final, Li Yanxi\\'s performance was clearly inferior to that of the preliminary stage. His first jump only scored 15.93 meters, and although his performance improved in the last two jumps, his state was clearly too late. His best score of 16.77 meters in three jumps was only 10 centimeters away from the top eight, and he missed the competition for the top eight. If Li Yanxi could reach the level of the preliminary race, he would have achieved the fifth place, which was also the ranking that Zou Zhenxian achieved in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Cao Shuo\\'s emergence adds a new force to the challenge of \"Zou Zhenxian Record Corps\". It is worth noting that most of the domestic athletes are in the golden period of their sports career, with the oldest Li Yanxi and Wu Bo only 25 years old. Chinese people have every reason to believe that they have the ability to break the \"beard record\" of triple jump. Of course, while surpassing Zou Zhenxian\\'s record, the athletes should also work on their technical stability, and perform at a high level in domestic and international competitions as Zou Zhenxian did, so that the Chinese triple jump can experience a true second spring.

Sina Entertainment News, on June 10, Beijing time, according to Hong Kong media reports, Deng Lixin and Fang Lishen\\'s rumors of romance have been circulating for several years. Recently, it is said that the two are close to a good thing, and even the record producer Lei Songde urges them to get married as soon as possible, and even says that the baby they will have will be very beautiful. When Deng Lixin heard this, she did not resist, and even thanked Lei Songde with a smile, as if she had acknowledged the relationship. Yesterday, Deng Lixin, together with a group of local stars including Chan Zhaoqi, Chan Waiho, and Kwok Kinpong, went to Mong Kok to host the opening ceremony of a World Cup event held in a shopping mall. They also tried out \"power shooting\" with giant cartoon boots, but Deng Lixin, who was \"delicate and dainty,\" only had the posture without the actual action. Deng Lixin said that she had watched the World Cup since she was young, but she had never tried to enjoy the event on site, and she had always supported Argentina. Asked if he likes watching ball games, regarding his rumored boyfriend Fanglishen. She said, \"Sure, boys like to watch it.\" As to the sudden news of her engagement, Deng Lixin joked that her friends called the hotel to inquire after reading the report, and when they found out that the hotel could only accommodate a dozen tables, they were sure that the report was not credible, as a dozen tables were not enough. Ask her how many tables she plans to set up? She smiled and said, \"I never thought about it. I don\\'t plan for things that are too far away.\" Fang Lishen recently revealed that his mother had pressured him to have a child, but whether or not he got married was secondary. However, Deng Lixin is not in a hurry to get married, and she said, \"If I really get married, I also want to have a child as soon as possible, but it\\'s not late to have a child at the age of thirty, there are still a few years, I am not anxious at all, and my family has not pressured me to get married, but Xiao Fang\\'s family seems to be urging him.\" \"(Miaofei)\"']\n"

On August 16, the Chinese Football Association punished the Guangzhou Evergrande player Mu Liuqi, which dealt a heavy blow to this Brazilian foreign player who performed very well this season. Since he learned that he was punished by the Football Association, Muriqui's mood has been very bad. The Brazilian is now very regretful of the impact he has caused on the team. Mourqi said about the punishment he received: I think the punishment from the Football Association is unfair, but I can still accept and obey it. On the 16th, Muriqui was punished by both the Guangzhou Evergrande club and the Chinese Football Association, which made the usually cheerful Brazilian immediately fall into a state of distress, especially after learning that he was banned from playing for five matches, Muriqui’s mood was very bad, and he locked himself in a room for a long time. Fortunately, his wife was always by his side, encouraging him, so it was not until nearly 20 hours after the punishment that Muriqui left the room, and it was not until noon on the 17th that he ate the first meal in 20 hours. Sinan Sports also contacted Muriqi through the translation of the team of the Evergrande, Muriqi said that he wanted to thank his wife now, when he was in trouble, he was always by his side, and he was also grateful to the club, who also comforted him all the time. When it comes to the punishment I received, Mucy said: I think the punishment from the Football Association is unfair, I did not go to violent harm, but now that the punishment has been imposed, whether it is fair or not, I accept it. What I want to say is that I am grateful to the club, although the club also punished me, but I first accept the punishment of the club, I think the punishment of the club to me is to help me. Since I can accept the punishment from the club, I should also accept and obey the punishment from the FA. What made Mu Lizhi most sad was the impact of his suspension on the team: the club has always been very good to me, and has given me a lot of help in all aspects. I have always been eager to repay the club and the team with good performance, but now I cannot participate in the game, and I feel very sad.

According to a report by Zheng Lei, a reporter, she should have enjoyed her old age, but she has been selling vegetables alone in the underground passage of Maidian Bridge. Recently, the \"fruit and vegetable grandma\" who became popular on the Internet has attracted a lot of attention, and many residents will deliberately pass by to give her a show when they get off work. The grandma of fruits and vegetables is no longer lonely. Yesterday at 5:30 PM, an elderly person with white hair, carrying a cloth bag and a plastic bag, appeared at the southeast corner of Maidian Bridge in Haidian District. Isn\\'t this the grandma of fruits and vegetables! A young man called out. Seeing the old man about to walk down the stairs, the young man hurried forward, \"Aunt Zhou, let me help you!\" Afterwards, the young man took the vegetables from the elderly Zhou Ruiying, whose face was full of smiles. Then three more young people recognized the old man and offered to help carry the vegetables for her. When a few young people put the vegetables in place and were about to leave, Aunt Zhou, with her body not very flexible, bent over and took a small bag of melons and said to the few young people, \"Children, take these fruits and eat them. It\\'s hot, eat a little to clear the fire.\" We will buy your things some other day. Several young people left with a smile. She saw her son only once in 30 years, and it was before 6 o\\'clock. Since it was not yet rush hour, Old Mrs. Zhou sat on a newspaper and chatted with the reporter about her family. The old man\\'s hearing was not good, she said, it was caused by a disease he had when he was young. When talking to people, the old man would press his left ear to the other person\\'s mouth. Mrs. Zhou said that as a native of Xuzhou, she came to Beijing with her military officer husband when she was young. Then, the son was admitted to Tsinghua University. After graduating from university, he went to the United States to pursue a master\\'s degree. Then, Zhou’s son married and had children abroad. “I have only seen him once in 30 years, that was the year his father passed away,” the old woman said, her head bowed, repeating the words. Her spouse passed away three years ago due to lung cancer. When asked why she did not call her son back to accompany her, the old man waved his hand and said, \"It\\'s too expensive to come back, I can live by myself.\" During the conversation, the old man\\'s tone and demeanor were noticeably more depressed each time he talked about his son. The old man also added that he had a daughter when he was young, but she was soon given away. The citizens flocked to the stall of the elderly woman, who was busy by 6 p.m. as the number of passers-by gradually increased, and Zhou Nainai\\'s stall became more prosperous. Besides the citizens who came to buy vegetables and fruits continuously, more than ten young people came to Zhou Nainai\\'s stall and said, \"Old Nainai of fruits and vegetables, we want to buy some fruits.\" Are you all on your way home from work? Faced with the sudden increase in young people, Old Mrs. Zhou was a bit unaccustomed. We are just passing by. He replied. This yardlong bean can be eaten by boiling, or blanched and dipped in sauce. The old man would always give a few more words of advice when selling each kind of fruit and vegetable. The reporters later learned that the group of young people were some netizens from Beijing, who had come together to cheer for Grandma Zhou, and they had specially organized a team. Everyone there bought some fruits and vegetables to some extent, and many people left the last scraps to the old man, calling it a kind of relief. She only wants to sell vegetables in a plain way. It is said that the old man has three wishes. One is to get a pair of glasses to see everyone\\'s face more clearly; two is to buy a hearing aid to hear what the customers say clearly; three is to want to have a few teeth inlaid to chew food better and eat more deliciously. Old Zhou Ruiying said that in recent days, she had noticed that more people were coming to buy fruits and vegetables than before, and many people would even call her \"Grandma Fruit and Vegetable.\" It was only after asking that she learned that this was a nickname given to her by netizens. This is my first nickname in my whole life. The old man smiled and said about that name. The old man also said that although the media came to interview her, she did not care, and she just wanted to provide a cheap and convenient place for people who could not buy vegetables and fruits when they got off work late. It\\'s nice to run things in a plain and simple way. She said. ■ Conversation · The first person to tweet was grateful for helping the old man. Beijing Times: How did you come up with the idea of posting this tweet? Cheng Xiaozheng: I happened to pass by that day, and I was very impressed when I saw the old man for the first time, feeling that he was very similar to my grandmother, and felt that I should help her. The Jinghua Times: Now, there are already quite a few netizens who are paying attention and coming to support the old lady. What do you think? Cheng Xiaozheng: At first, I just wanted the people around me to pay attention, but I didn\\'t expect such a big response. I think I have achieved my goal, and I\\'m very happy. The Beijing Times: Sometimes, a lot of people will come to buy the old man\\'s vegetables. Have you thought about whether too many people might affect the old man\\'s life? Cheng Xiaozheng: I never thought about it. It\\'s not uncommon for a microblog to be forwarded more than 10,000 times, but the effect it caused was beyond my expectation. I hope it won\\'t disturb the elderly too much.']\n"

On December 7, Julian Assange, the founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, was arrested by London police. Wikileaks immediately protested and emphasized that it would take countermeasures. Earlier, Swedish police issued an international warrant for Assange’s arrest on suspicion of rape and sexual harassment, among other crimes, across Europe and around the world. The lawyer denied that Assange had turned himself in. On December 7, the London police released a statement to the media that Assange, the founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, was arrested around 9:30 a.m. on that day. The statement emphasizes that the arrest was made on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant issued by Sweden. On February 2, Sweden issued an arrest warrant to Europe and the world, accusing Assange of rape and sexual harassment. At that time, Assange had arrived in London, UK. The British then met with Assange’s lawyers to express their intention to arrest him. Assange's lawyer strongly condemned the arrest and denied the media reports that Assange would surrender himself. Australian Assange, 39, was accused by Swedish police of rape and sexual harassment of two women in August. However, Assange has always denied this and condemned the Swedish police’s charges as politically motivated. The extradition could take months, and according to media reports, Assange is scheduled to appear in the Westminster court in London later that evening. It was reported that if the court eventually found the evidence of Assange's crime solid, he would be extradited to Sweden for sentencing. Assange will be detained in the UK before the judge makes the extradition ruling, and there is also a possibility of bail. The entire process from conviction to extradition may take several months. Since last week, WikiLeaks has been in trouble, including the cancellation of its Swiss bank account, the closure of the credit card payment platform, and the attack on the website. The U.S. government even launched criminal investigations into WikiLeaks and Assange himself, accusing them of threatening the national security of the United States and the country’s foreign policy actions around the world. Despite Assange's arrest, WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson commented that WikiLeaks strongly condemned the arrest of Assange and that they would continue with their existing actions to publish secret documents.

From the chart, the market situation is not yet fully bearish. In fact, we believe that the Hong Kong market is in a strong consolidation, and it is recommended to seize the opportunity to buy at a low price. The mainland will release a series of economic data today, the most eye-catching of which is the consumer price index (CPI) for October, which is expected to rise further to 4%. On the other hand, the G20 summit will also be held today, which will have a key impact on the trend of the US dollar and the flow of funds. The Hang Seng Index showed a fluctuating adjustment yesterday, pressing down to the level of 24,400 points, and then sideways. After filling the recent upward gap between 24,550 and 24,733 points, we estimate that the承接力 of Hong Kong stocks will have the opportunity to gradually increase. The Hang Seng Index closed at 24,501 points, down 210 points, with turnover on the main board at 109.2 billion yuan. Technically, the safety margin of the Hang Seng Index at the current level has been improved after two days of adjustment, and the deviation of the index from the moving average has improved. On the other hand, after the Fed implemented the second round of quantitative easing, the starting point of the explosion of the Hang Seng Index was 24,145 points, which was the closing price of last Wednesday. If the market's confidence in the second round of quantitative easing does not change, the Hang Seng Index should not fall below 24,145 points. The People's Bank of China announced an increase in the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points, which will take effect officially on the 16th of this month. The impact of the message on the real economy should be significant, and it is believed to be mainly due to excessive and excessive liquidity regulation, rather than a suppression move. After the recent consolidation of the shares of the domestic banks, the adjustment has averaged 5%, and it is believed that there is a chance for the support of the stock price to gradually strengthen. Notably, the insurance stocks in the mainland have risen against the trend, and the mainland is entering an interest rate hike cycle, which will increase the interest income of insurance stocks. China Ping An (2318) rose 3.6%, China Property & Casualty (2328) rose 0.17%, and China Taiping (2601) rose 3.13%.\"]\n"

In the two weeks ending on June 4, the world’s largest importer of soybeans, China, was no longer on the list of US soybean buyers, and in the past two weeks, China has also reduced its previously determined imports by more than 100,000 tons. Yesterday, the USDA released the export sales report for the week ending June 4, and the net soybean export sales for the 2008/2009 marketing year (starting from September 1, 2008) was -61,000 tons, far below the 200,000-300,000 tons expected by analysts. In this week, China cut its imports by 55,000 tons. And the U.S. soybean exports were also negative for the week ending May 28. For the week, net soybean exports were -24,000 tons, and China reduced its imports by 112,600 tons. So far this year, due to relatively cheap US soybean prices, the soybean harvest in Argentina has sharply decreased due to drought, and the demand for US soybeans from soybean importing countries including China has been high. According to USDA, as of May 28, the cumulative soybean export sales of the 2008/2009 marketing year in the United States were 33.7363 million tons, while the same period last year was 30.0143 million tons. China\\'s cumulative purchases of US soybeans reached 18.4691 million tons, while it was 13.4267 million tons in the same period last year. The \"crazy\" exports of US soybeans have led to a rapid decline in US soybean stocks, and the USDA\\'s monthly report on Wednesday predicts that at the end of the 2008/2009 crop year, US soybean stocks will be only 110 million bushels (about 3 million tons), which will be the lowest stock level since 1973. With tight inventory, US soybeans have risen rapidly in the past three months, and as of yesterday at 10:00 PM Beijing time, the July contract price of soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was 1260 cents/bushel, up nearly 45% from mid-March. Previously cheap US soybeans are now very expensive. According to Heilongjiang Tianqi Futures, if American soybeans are imported at the current soybean futures price, the cost price at Chinese ports will be as high as 4,300 yuan per ton, which is far higher than the domestic soybean price of 3,600-3,800 yuan per ton.

The total volume of transactions for the day was 251 contracts, with 456 unsettled contracts, an increase of 48 contracts from the previous trading day. From the intraday movement of the premium/discount between the main contract IF1011 and the spot price yesterday, the premium/discount value, which was high, was finally narrowed due to a slight drop in the afternoon of yesterday. The spread between the futures and spot prices mostly oscillated between 105 points and 135 points in the morning of yesterday, but it dropped sharply in the afternoon, reaching a low of around 85 points. Although the spread recovered somewhat after that due to the fact that the CSI 300 index did not continue to drop, it still oscillated between 95 points and 105 points. Although the spread between futures and spot prices has narrowed, arbitrageurs still have a 2.66% arbitrage opportunity. Considering that this is the arbitrage return in less than a month, it is still quite impressive. The open interest data disclosed by the China Financial Futures Exchange shows that Guotai Junan, the veteran \"Air Force Commander\", held 2,264 long positions, down 70 from the previous trading day; it held 5,232 short positions, down 260 from the previous trading day, and the net short positions decreased by 190 to 2,968. As for the new \"Air Force Commander\" Zhongzheng Futures, the long position held was 1,843 contracts, a sharp reduction of 464 contracts from the previous trading day, the short position held was 5,643 contracts, an increase of 71 contracts from the previous trading day, and the net short position increased by 535 contracts to 3,800 contracts. For the future, the new and old \"Air Force Commanders\" have different views. Guotai Junan did not take a positive position, but at least reduced the total position while slightly increasing the position, while Zhongzeng Futures was significantly reducing the short positions while slightly increasing the short positions, and the implication of being bearish was much stronger than Guotai Junan.']\n"

Among them, the relevant basic telecommunications enterprises are responsible for providing access services and charging SP enterprises, involving China Telecom for 58 cases, which is 29.27% lower than the previous quarter. Among the four major operators, China Telecom SP has the fewest complaints. For the management of SPs, the basic telecommunications enterprises are inescapable. As the value-added services become more prosperous, the importance of the SP market operating in a standardized manner is highlighted. The competition in the future will be between industrial chains, and the provision of information services requires the joint effort to expand the industrial chain. Although the appeal for SP regulation has been effective, the overall number of appeals has decreased significantly, but they are relatively concentrated. The data shows that there were 789 cases involving China Mobile, a decrease of 2.11% from the previous quarter; 516 cases involving China Unicom, a decrease of 13.71% from the previous quarter; and 58 cases involving China Netcom, an increase of 3.57% from the previous quarter. Currently, according to the principle of \"whoever connects is responsible\", it is mainly the basic telecommunications enterprises that are responsible for managing the relevant SPs. There are fewer complaints about SPs involving China Telecom, which to some extent indicates that China Telecom has achieved some success in regulating SPs. In 2007, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology established the \"Three Whos Principle\", that is, \"Whoever is in charge, whoever is responsible\", \"Whoever operates, whoever is responsible\", and \"Whoever connects, whoever is responsible\", aiming to clarify the responsibilities of each link, eliminate responsibility blind spots, and standardize the management of telecommunications information services. For this, China Telecom has established a series of rules and regulations for various cooperative businesses such as the Internet, voice messaging, and SMS for Little Smart, strictly controlling the network access, content review, agency fee management, and business assessment of SPs to ensure that partners provide legal and healthy content. For example, China Telecom has established a credit point management system for SPs that are connected, and included the non-compliant behavior of cooperative SPs in the scope of inter-enterprise cooperation management. The market scale of value-added telecommunications services is still untapped. According to the statistics and estimates of the Telecommunications Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, by the end of December 2006, the total scale of the value-added telecommunications service market in China exceeded 156 billion yuan, and it is expected to exceed 160 billion yuan in 2007. Undoubtedly, the market for value-added services is a \"gold mine\". The market scale of fixed-value-added services is smaller than that of mobile-value-added services. The existing value-added services in our country are ranked by revenue as information services, ISP, IDC, and call centers, and in the revenue of information services, mobile information services account for 75%, internet information services account for 23%, and telephone information services account for 2%. Clearly, mobile networks are more attractive to SPs, but there are reasons why fixed networks attract and retain SPs as well. There is still a lot of room for growth in fixed-value-added services. Including IPTV, fixed-mobile one-number service, broadband, and other value-added services provided by SPs, this is the new value space of the future. Mobile information services are a trend, and the development of mobile value-added services is rapid, becoming the main driving force for the growth of telecommunications operators\\' business revenue. According to the financial report, the revenue of value-added services of China Mobile in the first half of this year increased by 35.5% year-on-year to 41.915 billion yuan, accounting for 25.5% of the total operating revenue. As an important participant in the value chain of mobile value-added services, the SP group has grown rapidly. It is reported that in 2004, there were only 693 SP enterprises with operating licenses, and now the number of enterprises engaged in value-added services has surged to nearly 20,000, and more and more enterprises are applying for mobile value-added services. The development prospects of mobile value-added services are broad. On the one hand, the number of mobile communication users in China has exceeded 500 million, and all these users are potential users of mobile value-added services; on the other hand, the penetration rate of mobile value-added services is only around 30%, with huge development potential. Professor Zeng Jianqiu of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications said that with the launch of China\\'s 3G, the upgrade from narrowband to broadband, the traditional voice service era will be transformed into a value-added service era. Therefore, the development of value-added services cannot do without the support of 3G. The pace of change in China’s telecommunications value-added services market is accelerating, and industry development is becoming more rational. Basic telecom operators should cooperate with more enterprises, constantly innovate their operating models, and enhance the competitiveness of the industrial chain.']\n"

The website referred to in the phrase \"今天你干了CLY\" is the \"China Postgraduate Admission Information Network.\" According to the screenshot, after opening the post on the website, a random advertisement from Google appeared on the right side of the webpage, which was selling fake diplomas and exam answers. This sparked a heated discussion among netizens, some of whom believed that this had nothing to do with the website, as it was randomly generated with Google Ads; others believed that the website had the responsibility to reject inappropriate ads. The graduate school admission website has sparked heated online discussion with its \"one-stop service.\" The content is \"very shocking.\" \"Today, I was browsing the \\'China Graduate Admissions Information Network\\' and saw some information there. Using the popular phrase, it is \\'very shocking\\' – the admission information and cheating answers, as well as fake diploma advertisements, are on the same page.\" On October 31, a netizen named \"CLY Today You Did\" posted a thread on Mop, and provided a screenshot. The screenshot shows that after opening a post titled \"Graduate School Online Application Ends on November 31, On-site Confirmation on November 10-14\", there is an advertisement column on the right side of the page. This advertisement claims: \"Quickly get a bachelor\\'s degree and a master\\'s degree (real academic qualifications)\"; it also provides a phone number. Another advertisement claims: \"Master\\'s entrance examination answers QQ×××××××××\", which is further divided into \"09 postgraduate examination passed\" and \"postgraduate examination passed\", and both provide QQ numbers. The journalist found the \"China Graduate Admissions Information Network\" and, following the clues, discovered that the situation was indeed as the netizen \"CLY of today\" had said. The principal department of \"China Graduate Admissions Information Network\" is \"Ministry of Education College Students Affairs Department\", the hosting department is \"National Higher Education Students Information Consultation and Employment Guidance Center\", and the implementing department is \"Xuexin Consulting Service Co., Ltd.\" From the website content, it is rich in content, in addition to the information of the Ministry of Education and the admission and examination of various places, there is also the function of online registration for postgraduate entrance examination, and the popularity is very high. And the cheating advertisement posted by the netizen \"Today You Did CLY\" appeared in the right sidebar ad position of the same web page as the \"Postgraduate Entrance Examination News\" articles, with the words \"Ad provided by Google\". Who is responsible for the website advertisement? For the responsibility of the cheating advertisement, whether it is the responsibility of \"China Graduate Admissions Information Network\", netizens have been discussing heatedly. Netizen \"semiconductor\" believes that: there is Google\\'s ad bar next to the page, and this should be found with Google, and the content of the ad placement is decided by Google. Google’s ads are automatically matched to relevant ads based on the content of the website. And a netizen who calls himself \"Li Shenge\\'s Blue\" who claims to be in the field of online advertising pointed out that \"This is a Google online advertisement. The website has the right to make a profit by placing advertisements, but it has no right to block content.\" As long as the advertiser is willing to pay. First, Google did not do a good job of content blocking; second, the website placed advertisements to make a profit. Both sides are at fault. Netizen Shanfu believes that the advertisement is just a scam to \"make money\": \"In the end, the money is sent out and there is no reply, it is just to fool the foolish and those who seek a shortcut. Netizen \"Hong Fengche\" said, \"Anything is possible, China is a miraculous soil.\" Netizen \"Passing by Red Dust\" said: \"My wife is studying in a famous university in Northeast China, and she was surprised to find out that she was the only one in the dormitory who passed the exam without buying the answers... \"Netizen \"laijiaxing2002\" then joked: \"Google\\'s ads are very fair, this ad is the product with the highest relevance to the content of this webpage, very realistic, and well reflects the harmony of society, the harmony of nature, and the interdependence and mutual restraint of all things. Then, the netizen Lu Liqing revealed that the Ministry of Social Resources and Security of China, which is responsible for the civil service examination online, was selling answers, which was really disheartening. The netizen, \"Lianmin Lianyan\", expressed his distrust in the postgraduate entrance examination: I have gone crazy, and now I no longer regard those who call themselves postgraduates as postgraduates. But the netizen \"Teapot\" believes that this is just an individual phenomenon: \"Generally speaking, the admission of postgraduates to key universities is still very fair, and even for students of the same university to take postgraduate courses is very hard work.\" And most netizens also expressed deep concern: \"This will only provide a shortcut for those who want to get something for nothing, and a so-called official website of formal education actually turns a blind eye to such advertisements. Who will believe in the purity of diplomas and academic qualifications in the future?\" \"']\n"

      "['陈小瑛,郭台铭,王小庆,小卢,魏达志', '正向', 'Foxconn is recruiting a large number of temporary workers, which may be for the preparation of internal migration. Author: Chen Xiaoying Foxconn, which is caught in the wage increase and internal migration rumors, has a new situation. Recently, reporters from Huaxia Times found that thousands of summer workers from schools in other places flocked to the Fanuigang factory area for training. For this, Foxconn also stepped in to buy up residential houses around the factory area at a high price, to be used as temporary employee dormitories. After the journalists investigated, it was found that the college students who came to Foxconn for training in this batch were obviously different from those who were absorbed from society before; in addition, all the summer workers came from Henan. It is said that in recent days, the rumor about the relocation destination of Foxconn is most prevalent in Henan. Is Foxconn making preparations for relocation? While there were rumors of Hon Hai’s relocation, there were few voices from Hon Hai itself, and the direction of its relocation was shrouded in secrecy. According to the interviews conducted by the reporter from all sides, Foxconn\\'s various actions at this time point may be deliberately teasing in order to create a situation of competition among the mainland. Prepare for relocation? On July 5, a notice urging customers to move out was posted at the entrance of the residential building of the Fenghuan New Village, a farmer\\'s housing area at the north gate of Fenghuan Factory, Foxconn, requesting that the residents must move out by July 15 for a special reason. Wang Xiaoqing, a Foxconn employee, told the reporter that the Run Yuan residential area, which has four buildings, is located at the north gate of the factory zone. Recently, Foxconn has brought in a lot of summer workers without accommodation, so Foxconn has taken over the entire residential area at a high price. The rent increase was due to the sudden recruitment of thousands of summer workers by Foxconn, but Foxconn was not adequately prepared for the thousands of sudden summer workers. Many of those who just arrived could not be accommodated, and some slept on the ground at the entrance of Foxconn for four days. Wang Xiaoqing told the reporter. The reporter learned from the Foxconn Guanlan factory that all the summer workers who came for internship this time were from Henan Province. After two or three months of internship, the workers who passed the inspection and were willing to stay at Foxconn would be sent to various factories. The interns recruited by Foxconn enjoy the same salary待遇 as the workers, that is, a basic salary of 1200 yuan, with overtime pay calculated separately. Foxconn had posted recruitment notices all over the streets of Zhengzhou, but the locations listed on the notices were not in Zhengzhou, but in places like Huai\\'an and Yantai. Local people in Henan Zhengzhou told reporters that the Zhengzhou factory has not yet started construction. In the Fenghuanggang factory of Foxconn, Xiao Lu’s dormitory, which produces Apple computers, has moved in several interns, all from Henan Province. Among them, more than a thousand people from the same school came, and all the contracts were short-term. After two months of training, those who did not graduate will return to school first, and they themselves do not know the specific destination of their graduation. Journalists saw people coming to look for jobs at the south gate of the Foxconn Guanlan factory, but Foxconn was short of workers and only recruited uniformly from schools, not recruiting from society, which was a bit hard to understand. This is a unified strategy of the group, a decision made according to the needs of its own development. We don\\'t know the specific reasons, but recruiting a specific group of people is not a problem. A person from the human resources department of Foxconn told the journalists of the China Economic Times so. Recently, three of Apple\\'s products have entered mass production and need a large number of employees. An employee in A1 building of Guanlan District told the reporter that it might just be because of a sudden increase in orders and a temporary shortage of staff, so they are recruiting summer workers. To the reporter, the line leader of a certain line of the CNSBG business group of Foxconn Longhua denied that it was preparing for internal relocation: \"If it is just training, it can be directly trained in the factory that has already been built in the mainland. There is no need to spend more cost to run to Shenzhen specially. Training for line work is a very simple thing, you can learn it by looking, and you can start working in a week.\" What is Foxconn\\'s calculation? The clouds are gathering, what is Foxconn thinking? I don\\'t understand what Foxconn is up to. The Apple computer production line in Area A of Guanlan factory will soon move to Longhua factory. Recently, machines are often transported at night. Now they are recruiting people continuously, and a batch leaves and a batch comes. An administrative staff member of an office in the观澜 factory of Foxconn told the reporter. First, work with peace of mind, and move when it\\'s time to move. The employees in an office building in G District of Longhua Factory told reporters that because they had previously disclosed the direction of the relocation to the outside, the company\\'s top management issued an internal document to thoroughly investigate who had leaked the confidential information, and stated that they would punish the person severely. Now, Foxconn no longer informs the employees of any developments. The second round of salary increases for the company will be based on a three-month assessment starting from June 6. Those who pass the assessment will have their base salary increased to 2000 yuan. However, since a month has already passed, the specific assessment criteria have not yet been issued, and employees are skeptical about the second round of salary increases, as it is likely that only a few will meet the requirements. According to the union official of Foxconn, the detailed assessment criteria are currently being formulated, \"Foxconn has announced that the salary will increase, so it will definitely honor the qualified people, not just talk.\" Foxconn is busy recruiting people to Shenzhen while dealing with wage hikes and moving out of Shenzhen, and all these actions are hard to understand. Wei Dazhi, director of the Industrial Economics Research Center at Shenzhen University, told the press frankly, \"Foxconn is now like a small vendor shouting at customers, I am moving, come and grab it quickly.\" This creates a competitive effect that drives sales, and gives Foxconn more leverage in its choices. Wei Yatze believes that in industrial competition, the development stages of coastal and inland areas are different, and Shenzhen does not need Foxconn, while some cities in inland areas, such as Henan, a province with a large population, still welcome Foxconn, a company that can solve a large number of labor. But Foxconn’s choice was mainly for its own cost considerations. If, as the outside world says, the wages in Henan are the same as those in Shenzhen, Foxconn has no need to move. The media’s one-sided promotion just fell into Foxconn’s trap, as can be seen from the different false information that Henan has successively conveyed. It is a common sense question, but many people can\\'t figure it out. Wei Dazhi told the reporter.']\n"

Dian Jian, a drama produced by Hai Run TV, was broadcast in the prime time of Beijing TV yesterday. The drama, which integrates brotherhood, family and country, as well as exciting action scenes, has attracted a lot of attention since its broadcast. Hard man Wang Ting plays a dissolute Shanghai gang boss \"Dawenxiu\" in the drama, and he is not afraid of being compared by the audience with the classic role in \"Shanghainese\" on the screen. Wang Ting\\'s ten years of acting journey, \"Arrow Broken\" is a turning point, from the initial recognition of \"Major Case Team 6\" Ding Jian, to the passionate and burning \"Warrior\" Zheng Hushen, and then to the widely praised \"Prosperous State\" Xie Xundong, these tough guy roles witnessed Wang Ting\\'s growth. In these more than ten years, he has gradually grown from a slightly immature young man to the boss of the gang in \"The Broken Arrow\", who can control the situation at will. Behind the recognition of the audience, he has made countless efforts and suffered. After finishing the Arrow, Wang Ting said that it was the most exhausting play he had ever made, because there were too many fight and explosion scenes in the drama. It was also a turning point in his life, because it was the first time he changed his image and played a wild and unruly gang boss. At that time, all his energy was focused on the role, and even when we were resting, we were discussing the script, and there was almost no time for idle chatter. Wang Ting, who put a lot of effort into this play, is full of confidence in it and hopes to win the audience\\'s favor and see a different side of him. Wang Ting, the \"Eight Fingers Boss\", is not afraid to compete with \"Ding Li\" in提起上海滩的黑帮老大, the first thing that comes to mind is still Ding Li in the TV series Shanghai Beach. He is unruly, and can be both righteous and evil, a classic screen image. And Wang Ting, in this play \"The Broken Arrow\", plays a gang boss, Daxiu, who is unrestrained, a bit of a rascal, but righteous. He has grown into the soul of the first gang in Shanghai, \"Dragon Gang\", relying on his courage and excellent skills. He grew up in the turbulent old Shanghai and knew the hardships of the people, so after seeing the brutal slaughter by the Japanese, he endured humiliation and entered the Japanese camp, secretly promoting the anti-Japanese tide in Shanghai. Unfortunately, he was later chopped off two fingers by the Japanese and became the \"Eight-finger Boss\". Compared with Ding Li, Daxiu is less shrewd and more generous. He is concerned about the country and the people, and is not tempted by external temptations. He is willing to bear all misunderstandings silently. This unique personality also attracts the affection of many beautiful women. The famous singer Lu Xiaoying (Chen Derong), and the childhood sweethearts Long Meijun (Zhang Dinghan) are all captivated by him. I believe that Daxiong, this eight-fingered big boss, will not be inferior in front of classics.']\n"

On the afternoon of October 15, 2011, the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship in Tokyo, Japan, ended the men's rings final, Chinese athlete Chen Yibing (blog) with 15.800 points to win the men's rings champion, this is his fourth time to win the World Championship men's rings champion. Narbette from Brazil won the silver medal with 15.600 points, and Yamashita Kōshi from Japan won the bronze medal with 15.500 points. Kohei Uchimura went first, and his difficulty was not high. He should have been able to complete it normally, but it seems that his physical exhaustion was enormous. He failed to complete the last horizontal cross, nearly falling off the apparatus, and finally he got 14.633 points. Chen Yibing was the second to perform, and he started with a right-angle cross, a horizontal cross, and an inverted cross, all three crosses were perfectly in place! The cross, the inverted cross, and the horizontal cross after the back swing, all fully displayed the power, Chen Yibing, the king of rings, gave a textbook perfect performance, and finally, the 720 spin down without a trace, 15.800, the E score was 9.000! The third to appear was Brazilian Nabaleti Zane, who ranked just behind Chen Yibing in the preliminary round. He used his strength impressively, and his crosses were all very standard, with no problem with the static time. However, he did not do the split horizontal support well, and he scored 15.600 points. The next American athlete to appear, Horton, is clearly not in the medal-winning category, and his poor form this year has continued into this competition. He failed to complete even the less difficult moves, and he scored 14.300 points. The Dutch veteran Van格尔德, who returned after being released, was the fifth to appear. His difficulty was also very high. He did a very good job with the several very physically demanding crosses at the beginning of the performance, but he became less natural as the performance went on. It was a bit difficult to get to the horizontal in the back swing, and he sat on the ground with a front double back. He got 14.666 points. Veteran Mollandi from Italy followed, who, like Van格尔德, had excellent crosses with a sense of power in the first half, but could not keep up with the latter half of the strength, and finally failed to stop before the landing, although he stood straight and vertical, he only got 15.200 points. Calmón from Venezuela was not difficult, but his completion was not so good, and he fell forward on the ground, getting 14.266 points. Koichi Yamamuro was the last to perform, and his performance was still not bad. The horizontal cross, right-angle cross, and inverted cross were also in place. The static time of the horizontal cross after a front double back was also sufficient. He took a small step back in a vertical spin down. The difficulty score of this set was slightly lower than Chen Yibing's. He got 15.500 points, and Chen Yibing won the gold medal without any悬念! Powerful\"]\n"

Hunan Red Network, April 1 (Reporter Liu Can) - After the video of the deputy county magistrate of Fuyu County, Jilin Province, losing his temper and slamming the door was exposed, it continued to cause heated discussion among netizens. The deputy county magistrate Gao Yong, who was described as \"slam door king\" and \"the most undisturbed deputy county magistrate\" by netizens, was given the titles of \"slam door king\" and \"the most undisturbed deputy county magistrate\" because of his \"outburst, profanity, slamming the door, and doing whatever he wants\". Netizens also showed great concern about whether the relevant officials had been punished according to law and discipline. On April 1, the reporters from Hongwang Network made a telephone connection with several units in the Jilin Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Soft Environment Office, and so on. It is reported that Songyuan City has initiated an investigation into Vice County Governor Gao Yong and others involved in the case, and the formal handling results will be announced as soon as possible. Jilin Province\\'s Soft Environment Office: 8 people have been investigated. Jilin Province\\'s Soft Environment Office confirmed that during the period when Jilin Dekka Company invested in Fuyu County, the county government did not keep its word, the efficiency of handling affairs was low, which affected the construction of the company\\'s projects and caused significant losses. The provincial soft environment office has instructed the Discipline Inspection Commission of Songyuan City to investigate. The city of Songyuan launched an investigation into Vice County Governor Gao Yong and eight others involved in the case, and imposed severe warnings within the party, administrative reprimands, and dismissals from office. Meanwhile, the staff of the Development Environment Complaint Center of the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Songyuan City confirmed that the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Songyuan City had indeed launched an investigation into Gao Yong and others according to the requirements of the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Jilin Province and the Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province, and had already reported the proposed handling results to the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Bureau of Jilin Province and the Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province. As to which eight people have been investigated and what kind of punishment they will receive, the staff member said that it is confidential before the CCDI\\'s investigation is announced, and the results will be announced as soon as they are officially released. \". He also said that the Siping Discipline Inspection Commission has intervened and made multiple efforts to mediate the land dispute between Deca Group and Fuyu County Government, and that Fuyu County Government is still in talks with Deca Group. Xu Jie, the county party secretary of Fuyu, who was exposed by Jilin TV in November 2010 and was called \"irresponsible\" by netizens, was elected as the deputy secretary of the standing committee of the people\\'s congress of Songyuan on January 14, 2011. Also, a piece of information on the Fusong County government website shows that Xu Jie is currently the vice chairman of the Songyuan Municipal People\\'s Congress Standing Committee and the secretary of Fusong County Party Committee. In the information on the Fusuyi County Government website on March 22, 2018, which was titled \"Our County Convened a New Rural Construction Work Conference,\" Liu Shuling, the Party Secretary of Fusuyi County and Director of the County Party Office, who was \"drunk,\" still held the original position to host the \"New Rural Construction Work Conference.\" As for the vice-county magistrate Gao Yong, who had a temper tantrum, swore, and slammed the door, the government website still lists him as a county leader, with the responsibility of “assisting the county magistrate in charge of the Transportation Bureau, Construction Bureau, Urban Construction Development and Management Office, Urban Comprehensive Law Enforcement Office, Family Planning and Population and Family Planning Bureau, Radio and Television Administration Bureau, and Radio and Television Network Company.” Subsequently, in order to learn about the progress of the handling of the land dispute between Deca Group and Fuyu County Government, the reporter dialed Fuyu County \"County Magistrate\\'s Open Telephone (0438-5862345)\" to try to contact the relevant person in charge, but no one answered the phone. [Further news] The results of the handling of Gao Yong, vice-county magistrate of Fuyu County, and others were announced. Four people were dismissed from their posts. Rednet, April 1 (Reporter Liu Can). At 7:35 p.m. on April 1, Rednet reporters made a follow-up call to the Discipline Inspection Commission and the Provincial Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province. A leader of the Jilin provincial discipline inspection committee confirmed to the media that after the investigation of the administrative inaction of the vice-county magistrate of Fuyu county and others, the Standing Committee of the Siping Discipline Inspection Committee decided to give the vice-county magistrate of Fuyu county, Gao Yong, a serious warning within the party and a demerit; to give the director of the county construction bureau, Liu Changwen, a revocation of his position within the party and a demotion; to give the director of the county health bureau, Li Chunhui, a revocation of his position within the party and a demotion; to give the director of the county land bureau, Ju Dianyin, a major demerit; to give the former secretary of the county committee of the CPC and the current director of the new area of the agricultural high-tech development zone of Siping city, Zhou Guangxin, a warning within the party; to give the director of the planning department of the county construction bureau, Zhou Zhongyou, a demotion; and to give the director of the land conservation department of the county land bureau, Wang Baowen, a demotion. He also revealed that on the video conference of the work of rectifying and building the soft environment for economic development in Jilin Province on March 30, the case had been reported to the whole province, and today it was officially released to the media. He said, \"The Jilin provincial disciplinary committee and the netizens share the same feeling, hoping for severe punishment of such behavior.\" Discipline inspection and supervision will further increase the intensity of investigating and punishing. For the netizens’ follow-up questions about Liu Shusheng, the Party Secretary of Fuyu County Committee and Director of the Office of the Fuyu County Committee drinking during working hours, the official said that Fuyu County had already taken corresponding measures.']\n"

According to the CNN report cited by the Central News Agency, Constable Mutumba is the police officer in charge of the case. Mutambe said that George was arrested for allegedly possessing marijuana, and had resisted arrest, and was due to appear in court on February 2. The report noted that George is currently detained at the Huruma police station in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. CNN reporters went to the cell to talk to him, and George denied such accusations. He said, \"They took me away from my home.\" I don\\'t know why they are suing me. Although George met Obama, he hardly knew the other. Among Obama\\'s close relatives, only a few did not attend the inauguration of the president held in Washington last week, and George was one of them.

Reports say that George and Obama are half-brothers. In his memoir, Obama wrote that he sought to mend his relationship with his father. Obama\\'s father left him and his mother during his childhood.

Guojie and Liujunfeng, Chinese players, also played well, shooting 67 under par 4, tied for fourth place. Craig-Scott did not arrive in Shunde until 5 p.m. on Wednesday due to passport problems. He drove a golf cart around the golf course, which was equivalent to practicing. On Thursday, in a completely blind drive, the Australian caught 5 birds, shot an eagle, although he swallowed a bogey in the fifth four-hole, he ultimately led the Irish player Eddie Barr and the Australian player Brad McIntosh. The next two players shot 66, five under par, in the first round. Stephen Leaney, the 2003 U.S. Open runner-up, had a good start and finish today, shooting four under par in the first three holes and closing with two birdies. But he had a double bogey and a bogey in the middle of his round and finished with a 67, tied for fourth with Chinese players Gao Jie and Liu Junfeng and South Korea’s SeaWoo Sung. Perhaps it would have been better not to see the stadium. Craig Scott, who played on the Canadian Tour for four years, half-jokingly said, \"You don\\'t know where the danger is until you see the course.\" Craig-Scott\\'s good performance at Jumeriah was actually due to his good performance with his long irons. He is one of the top three players in driving distance on the Australian巡回赛. On Thursday, although the green was not rolling much, his driving distance was 290 to 295 yards. Of course, it is also crucial that these balls can stop on the fairway. Craig-Scott only had one tee shot that didn\\'t go on the fairway today. Moreover, he also had a lucky ball. On the 15th par-3 hole, he hit his drive to about 10 yards past the green, near the pin. He caught the bird as soon as he entered the hole. Longer driving distance always gives an advantage at Junlan International Golf Club. Craig-Scott\\'s fellow countryman Brad-McIntosh also expressed a similar sentiment after carding a 66 in the early hours. The player made 9 eagles today, but also swallowed 4 bogeys. Brad McInnes, who won two rounds in Australia, said, \"This round was a bit up and down, with many eagles and many bogeys, but it was not because of overdriving the tee.\" Bogey mainly occurred because of the poor short game and some three putts. The strength of taking the opening kick also put Liu Junfeng in the forefront. As the only player in the China Tour who has ever made an albatross, Liu Junfeng made 6 birdies and 2 bogeys today. Gao Jie, a player from Luoyang, Henan Province, also holds this view, and he even thinks that the length of the court is shorter. The 29-year-old player, who just obtained his professional qualification in the professional examination in Jinwan, Zhuhai this year, said, \"This score is very good, but I still missed a few birdies, otherwise it would have been even better.\" Zhang Liangwei shot 71, par, Wu Aishun shot 70, one under par, and Liang Wenchong shot 69, two under par. Today my iron is a little left and my wood is a little right. This made it difficult for me to get close to the flagstick, which is why I don\\'t have many birdie opportunities. Liang Wenchong said, \"In addition, the speed of the practice green is different from that of the actual green, so the force of the short putts was not well controlled.\" But overall, I am in pretty good shape now. Liang Wenchong has just returned from the Japan Tour. He finished as the runner-up in the Asia-Pacific Open, which was co-sanctioned by the Asian and Japan Tours, and he would have finished in the top 10 at the Canon Open last week had he not shot a 74 in the first round. That race, which was shortened to three rounds due to bad weather, he eventually finished in a tie for 17th place. Click to view detailed scores>>(Little Wind)']\n"

Chen, who runs a business of assembling computers in the Computer City, said that a boy who looked like a student came into the store around 2 pm yesterday, saying that he wanted to assemble a game computer. After talking for more than ten minutes, he left because the price was too high. After he left, I habitually looked at the desktop and found that my phone was missing.

After the security guard intervened, a crowd gathered, and someone in the crowd testified that the person was a thief. Salesman Xiao Liu, who deals with consumables, said that the other day, after this person came and left, his mobile phone was lost. As more and more people gathered to watch, six people in succession testified that the person had stolen a mobile phone. In the face of public accusations, the thief admitted to the theft and handed over Mr. Chen's mobile phone. In the chaos, two more stolen cell phones fell out of his pocket. Everyone demanded that the thief be handed over to the police, but they did not expect the thief to take out a small knife and cut his wrist, threatening to commit suicide and begging for mercy from the crowd.

Estrella revealed in his column that since Mourinho came to Real Madrid, one of his main acquisition targets has always been a forward. Although Real Madrid already had attackers like Higuain and Cristiano Ronaldo, Mourinho wanted a striker of a different style, and he hoped that the club’s management would bring in a powerful center forward who was good at breaking the deadlock in the penalty area. There had been media speculation that Real Madrid were interested in Mario Gomez of Bayern Munich and Amauri of Juventus, but the name that Mourinho actually mentioned was Fernando Llorente, who plays for Athletic Bilbao. Llorente has all the qualities that Mourinho asked for: he is good at heading, has good ball control with both feet, has good running awareness, and is good at drawing defenders away from the center back. In addition, Lorente also has rich experience in major competitions, and his contribution to the Spanish team winning the World Cup in South Africa is also worth mentioning. Mourinho hopes that略伦特 can join as soon as possible so that Real Madrid can perfect its player structure. With the arrival of H迪拉 at halftime and Real Madrid's operation at the wing-back position, it is likely that略伦特 will be the unexpected acquisition that completes the team. But whether or not the deal will go through still depends on Lozano’s own stance and that of Athletic Bilbao. Llorente's release clause is around 36 million euros, and many teams have already inquired about his situation. (KKGonzalez)\"]\n"

On the 27th, Israel launched airstrikes with fighter jets and armed helicopters on Gaza, and more than 1,000 people, including senior military officials of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), were killed and injured. Why did Israel attack Hamas so fiercely? Middle East media analysis believes that Israel mainly considers three aspects. One was in retaliation for Hamas’s rocket attacks. In June this year, Hamas and the Gaza Palestinian faction, which was mainly represented, reached a ceasefire agreement with Israel, which was due to expire at the end of December. From then on, the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis began to heat up. The Israeli military said that Hamas had fired hundreds of rockets into Israeli territory since the 18th. For this, Israel must retaliate to strike at the “arrogance” of “terrorism”. Second, for the need of domestic politics. At the beginning of next year, Israel will hold a general election. The competition is now intense. Netanyahu, chairman of Likud, and others have long accused the government of being “weak,” and many in Kadima believe that Olmert is “inept.” Olmert is under great pressure. The authorities\\' extensive bombing of Gaza was the result of pressure from all sides, and only in this way could Olmert defeat the competition from other parties such as Likud in the elections, otherwise he would lose the election as the polls showed, in the elections early next year. Israel took advantage of the power vacuum during the U.S. political transition. Now that President Bush is about to leave office and President-elect Obama has not yet taken office, Israel believes that this special period is the best time to launch an attack on Hamas. On the 24th, the Israeli cabinet held a meeting to approve the IDF\\'s military and political targets in Hamas. Israel once again used its customary “lightning war” tactic, with all aircraft types operating in concert at nearly the same time, pounding nearly 50 targets in Gaza with massive bombing runs, causing heavy casualties. However, in terms of actual results, it is difficult for Israel to achieve its goal of eliminating Hamas. First, such a large number of casualties will inevitably arouse strong dissatisfaction and condemnation from the international community, and some Arab countries also demand an emergency summit meeting to discuss the situation. It is reported that the Arab League will hold an emergency meeting in two days to study countermeasures. Second, Hamas will unite more than ever in the face of casualties, and win more hearts and supporters, thus going against Israel’s original intention. Afterwards, Hamas issued a statement calling on its military personnel and supporters to launch the most intense retaliatory actions against Israel in various ways. Hamas members were all fired up, vowing to retaliate against Israel \"eye for an eye\" and make Israel a \"sea of blood\". Even the mainstream Palestinian Liberation Organization (Fatah) stood with Hamas, condemning the attack and its heavy toll. The interim Palestinian government declared a three-day period of mourning for Palestinians killed in the Israeli air raid. Of course, more seriously, if the situation deteriorates further and even gets out of control, the cycle of violence between the Palestinians and Israelis will restart, and the Middle East peace process will be completely ruined. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become a “chronic ailment” of the Middle East situation, and now, the momentum of the conflict is becoming more prominent, and the development of the situation is worrying. Practice has proved that force is not a way to resolve contradictions. The only way to solve all problems is to achieve peace through negotiation.']\n"

      "['王锦,徐海洋,徐炜,钱妤', '正向', 'This year, the amount of funds raised by IPOs has dropped by nearly 80% according to Wang Jin. Statistics show that so far this year, a total of 77 companies have made their debut on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges through IPOs, excluding Shanghai Electric\\'s IPO without fundraising. The 76 companies other than Shanghai Electric raised about 103.4 billion yuan in funds, with an average P/E ratio of 27 times. Due to the deep adjustment of the stock market, the number of IPOs issued this year has decreased significantly compared to the same period last year, with the number of IPOs decreasing by 38% compared to 123 in 2007, and the total amount of funds raised decreasing by 78% compared to 4770 billion yuan in 2007. Apart from the significantly slowed issuance pace, there have been few large-cap IPOs so far this year, with only five companies issuing more than 500 million shares, accounting for 6% of the total number of IPOs, compared to 17% last year. But large caps still played a major financing role. These five companies raised a total of 73.3 billion yuan in funds, accounting for 70% of the total IPO fundraising this year. Among the IPO companies this year, China Coal Energy raised the most funds, reaching 25.6 billion yuan; China South Rail issued the largest number of shares, 3 billion shares. Despite 13 trading days remaining in December, insiders estimate that the resumption of IPOs this year is unlikely. The strategy analyst of Minsheng Securities said that the current market financing function depends entirely on the good or bad of the market. If there is a cross-year situation, there may be some SME board IPOs in January or the first quarter next year. However, Xu Haiyang, chief strategy analyst of Nomura Securities, said that the current market environment does not meet the conditions for restarting the IPO, and there is no hope of seeing the IPO opening within three months. Xu Wei, a strategy researcher at Guo Jin Securities, also said that the resumption of IPOs may not be until the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter next year, and the management will consider the market situation more.

In particular, medium and small-sized banks have seen the most significant decline in the amount raised from the two types of business. The Shanghai Banking Regulatory Bureau\\'s \"2008 Third Quarter Personal Wealth Management Business Analysis Report\" released yesterday shows that as of the end of September 2008, the balance of personal wealth management products in the Shanghai market was 134.226 billion yuan, up 25.47% from the end of the previous quarter and up 64.62% from the same period last year; a total of 135.62 billion yuan was raised, up 5.14% from the previous quarter and up 74.35% from the same period last year.

An evening concert for Wang Yiwén, who just turned 10, will be held in the Yifu Hall of Zhengzhou University tomorrow night. The theme of the concert was a phrase that the young pianist Lang Lang gave her: \"With music in your heart, there is light in your eyes.\" \"Evening News reporter Peilei/Text, Ma Jian/Photo, Xiao Yiyun was greatly interested in the electronic piano at the dress rehearsal.\" Yiwen\\'s monologue: I bring joy to everyone with my songs. I grew up with music, and wonderful and magical stories filled my happy childhood.

Now, I am 10 years old, and I am willing to bring joy to everyone with my singing. Yiwen\\'s wish: to see the world and her mother. Yesterday morning, in a TV studio of Henan TV Station, Yiwen did a rehearsal for a TV program with her mother. Playing the piano and singing songs, Yiwen on the stage was particularly eye-catching. And her mother, Wang Fei, stood below, smiling and silently watching her daughter. The applause broke out, and the host asked Yiwen what her dream was. Yiwen said without thinking, \"I hope my eyes can see, I want to see my young mother.\" Wang Fei\\'s eyes were moist.

In 2008, a good opportunity passed her by. Lang Lang\\'s Zhengzhou concert invited Yiwen, but for various reasons, the performance was ultimately canceled. Lang Lang\\'s agent, Li Ning, specially called from the United States to make a transoceanic call to convey Lang Lang\\'s encouragement to Xiao Yiyun: \"As long as there is music in your heart, there will be light in front of you.\" \"I think this experience really encouraged Yiwen, and since then, Yiwen has practiced the piano more seriously and diligently.\" Wang Fei said.

      "['安德雷阿·蒙蒂,托马西,贝雷塔,德拉瓦莱,里诺·邦菲', '正向', 'SportMediaset: The strike slapped a million fans in the face and touched the most ridiculous point of history. Greetings, I give you the score: 3. Andrea Monti of La Gazzetta dello Sport To all the presidents, players and administrative bodies, you have given us the usual result, as in a surreal game: all losers, no winners. This weekend, the ghost of football was wandering in the empty stands, perhaps celebrating a beautiful own goal for all of Italy. This strike, or blockade, or delay – call it what you will – is a slap in the face of millions of football fans. Gentlemen of the football world, the rich and the powerful, do not dream, fans are weak, but not fools, to win back the lost hearts and minds, to win back the credit you have lost and are still falling, to repair the damage caused by the own goal, that is not something that can be achieved in a day or two. You are throwing stones at your own feet, and you will have to taste the bitter fruits in the future. Any attempt to analyze the essence of the problem in terms of one or another clause of the collective contract is a waste of breath, for the reality is that the most laughable aspect of reaching the historical low point is the crisis of the Italian football system, which is a political and economic crisis. Look, no one can control the situation, no one can change the trajectory of the blunder, which indicates that all those involved are equally guilty. The people vent their anger on the players, yes, they are spoiled idols who consider themselves rock stars, and feel it is a great injustice if they are not in the same group for training, and describe themselves as unemployed. Yes, they are the most wealthy laid-off workers on the earth. But it is also true that most players are professional and dedicated, without being picky. Though Tomasi was incompetent, he was still trying to avoid a breakdown. In the end, it was the bosses, our core figures in football, who shook their heads. They are absurd, united unprecedentedly but also divided unprecedentedly. If the players are spoiled, it is because they are spoiled; if a team has 50 players, it is because they bought them; and the fiscal deficit, they caused it. If Beretta is like a clown, the fault is not a certain law, but that the bosses have too much power, without boundaries and uncontrolled. Players, like all citizens, seem to have powers that are effective upwards but not downwards, when it comes to paying extra taxes. The Délavall Football Regulatory Commission suggested that there were supporters and opponents, and I think this is the right way. Football investors need to find a professional or a team as soon as possible, with independent power and thinking space to formulate new football rules, promote them, and communicate with other stakeholders in other fields. More importantly, a comprehensive marketing strategy to promote Serie A products and maximize their value should be developed, learning from the unity and overseas expansion model of the Premier League and La Liga. Stop complaining about the stars leaving, stop blaming the decline in观赏性 and combativeness of Serie A, stop saying that we are just superficial and not hitting the key points. We really are going to become a European village. Rino Bongiorno, the protagonist of the film \"The Football Coach\", said, \"If we couldn\\'t buy Socrates, we would buy Aristotle.\" All actions must conform to philosophical logic, anyway. \"']\n"

      "['周宏,王振州', '正向', 'Fund investment strategy is gradually narrowing the door, and equity funds are similar for several months in a row. Reporter Zhou Hong If we make a statistical summary of the stock investment strategy of funds in the past two months, the result may be surprisingly similar. With the震荡market as the main judgment, and consumption, new energy and other industries as the investment theme, the investment strategy of equity funds has been the same for several consecutive months. Like a life, a fund’s investment strategy should also have a beginning, development, maturity, and even a gradual correction process. But the investment strategy of the funds remained unchanged in these two months when the A-share market was rapidly unfolding. What made the fund strategies\\' \"awkward\"? Structural strategies are still in the dark about when, but \"capturing structural opportunities\" has become the only theme for the next stage of investment strategies in the fund industry. Taking the investment views of a joint venture fund announced last week as an example, \"Given the uncertainty of macro policies, the large-cap index is expected to continue to maintain an oscillating pattern. After the small and medium-sized cap theme stocks have been active for a long time, they have accumulated a substantial profit, and there is room for adjustment, but the large-cap stocks have limited room to fall.\" In terms of sectors, we are bullish on industries with strong risk resistance and stable growth. Such speculations had been rampant in the industry months earlier. In the semi-annual report of the fund, the large fund management companies such as Guangfa and Huana all focus on the combination of \"new industries\" and \"large consumption\". And even back then, strategic emerging industries, which include new energy, electric vehicles, rare earths, and upstream raw materials, as well as large consumer sectors such as food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, home appliances, and retail, had already become popular sectors among fund managers. Up to now, there has been little change in this situation. What is the difficulty of macro policy, and where does it come from? Many fund managers believe that the root cause is the current macroeconomic environment. One fund manager at Bosera Fund believes that economic transformation will not be achieved in one fell swoop, especially in the current situation of slowing economic growth, and the adjustment of economic structure will take precedence over growth rate in the long term. In the coming years, it is expected that the cost of production factors such as resources and labor will gradually increase, and the RMB will gradually appreciate. Under the premise of ensuring stable growth of investment and exports, the intensity of social security will gradually increase, and during this process, consumption services and scientific and technological innovation will receive more policy support. And another fund believes that the 3.5% year-on-year CPI data has once again sparked market speculation about interest rate hikes. But given the expectation that inflation will stabilize and economic growth remains uncertain, interest rates are unlikely to be raised significantly, and stability will still be the main theme for the year. If inflation continues to rise, the central bank may also raise the benchmark interest rate slightly to improve the negative real interest rate situation and manage inflation expectations. In such a tortuous macroeconomic environment, it is indeed a great pressure to clarify the investment priorities. The industry allocation \"inertial thinking\" may also affect fund managers, including inertial investment thinking. And this kind of thinking often becomes the representative of the extremes in various industries. An influential investment director in the industry has previously stated that risk aversion is currently dominating the entire institutional group, pushing the valuation of non-cyclical stocks to extremes. This is an emotional view. Is the risk of non-cyclical companies really non-existent? Are cyclically companies really not performing well? He asked in return. There may be another judgment in the industry. Wang Zhenzhou, a fund manager of Shanghai Pute Morgan, said that from the perspective of the economic cycle, the GDP is expected to be above 8 in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. The actual situation of the real economy is better than the previous expectation, so the space for the large market to go down is not big. Moreover, the opportunities for low PE blue chips will also emerge, given their high correlation with the overall economic situation. Of course, this view is still in the minority in the industry at present.']\n"

      "['刘彤,达戈韦托·罗德里格斯,罗德里格斯,克雷格·凯利,布什,奥巴马', '正向', \"The United States and Cuba held new rounds of migration talks in Havana. Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 19 (Reporter Tong Rong) The Cuban and US government delegations held closed-door talks on migration issues in Havana on February 19. This is the second round of immigration talks between the two governments since the resumption of immigration negotiations between Cuba and the US on July 14, 2009. Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Dagoberto Rodriguez and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Craig Kelly led their respective delegations in the negotiations. The Cuban delegation's press release after the negotiations said that both sides evaluated the implementation of the bilateral migration agreement reached and discussed the new draft on migration issues proposed by the Cuban side in the previous round of negotiations. The communiqué said that Cuba reaffirmed its position on migration issues in the negotiations, namely, ensuring legal, safe, and orderly migration between the two countries, and implementing effective cooperation in combating illegal trafficking in persons. The ancient formula also expressed its willingness to continue immigration talks with the US at an appropriate time. Rodriguez said that Cuba had strictly implemented the immigration agreement signed with the United States in 1994, but the so-called Cuban Immigrant Amendment that the United States was still implementing prevented the two countries from achieving legal, safe and orderly immigration. The Cuban Adjustment Act, promulgated by the US government, stipulates that any Cuban who steps on the territory of the United States will be granted residence. This actually encourages some illegal immigrants in Cuba to risk their lives to illegally immigrate to the United States. After the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the U.S. government adopted a policy of encouraging Cubans to leave their homeland, but the entry of a large number of illegal immigrants also put great pressure on American society. In 1994, the governments of the United States and Cuba signed an agreement, under which Cuba promised to take measures to stop illegal migration to the United States, and the United States agreed to receive at least 20,000 legal Cuban immigrants annually. Under the ancient and modern migration agreement, the two countries should hold at least one migration negotiation every year to evaluate the implementation of the migration agreement. In 2003, the Bush administration indefinitely postponed negotiations with Cuba on immigration, citing a lack of Cuban诚意. After Obama moved into the White House, the two governments resumed the immigration talks.\"]\n"

      "['马全胜,孙旭,许万国,付强,王峰,吴天宇,刘晓艳,张东,蒋瑛琨,徐明,王群航,高贵鑫', '正向', 'Funds break through the dilemma with innovation: Index futures add new weight Since the first quarter, 14 innovative fund products have \"rescued\" the A-share market, accounting for 39% of newly issued funds, and even a situation where four innovative products were launched on the same day has appeared. \"Innovation\" almost became the most talked about topic in the fund industry this year, and the official launch of index futures and margin trading business further opened up the strategic space for fund product innovation. Throughout the year, the weight of \"innovation\" in various fund products has also become heavier, with index products becoming more specialized, the frequent use of leverage, diversified QDII going overseas, and ETFs and their connected funds becoming increasingly popular. However, behind these product innovations, there is an effort by the fund industry to break through the serious product homogenization, sales relying on luck, and declining industry profit margins. ⊙Reporter Ma Quansheng and Sun Xuduo of the News Agency of China. Multiple new funds have been launched and innovation has been continuous. As of April 19, a total of 36 new funds have been launched this year, of which 32 have been invested in the domestic market, and 4 are QDII. Style-index products, leveraged分级 funds, ETFs and their connected funds have become mainstream. In addition, the first QDII fund in China to adopt the LOF model, the Guotou Ruiyuan Global Emerging Market Select Stock Fund, will be issued in the near future; Haitong Fund is preparing to issue a \"two-habitat\" QDII product that can invest in both A-shares and H-shares; Huaxun Fund and the FT Group have also reached an agreement to authorize the development of a cross-border ETF product targeting the FTSE 100 index… innovative fund products are filling the gaps in China\\'s various niche market segments at an unprecedented pace. Among various innovative products, first, the stylization of index funds has gradually become a trend. Whether it is the first industry index fund – Guotou Ruiyuan CSI 300 Financial and Real Estate Index Fund – which ended the fundraising recently, or the first A-share market style index ETF and its connected fund – Huabao Xingye SSE 180 Value ETF and its connected fund, or the first index fund tracking the innovation fundamental index – TaiDa HongLi CSI Wealth Large Cap Index Fund, they are all stylized index products developed on the basis of the explosive development of index funds in 2009. On the one hand, due to the fact that index funds are passive investment products with strong exclusivity, in order to avoid homogenization competition, fund companies must actively innovate and develop index products with different style characteristics. On the other hand, with the large expansion of index funds last year, the development of new indexes also shows an accelerating and differentiated design trend. Therefore, the issuance of index funds with different style characteristics has been endowed with multi-faceted conditions. The phrase \"Longxin CSI Central SOE 100 Index Fund Manager Xu Wanguo hit the nail on the head.\" is spot on. Fu Qiang, the chief financial engineer of China Securities, believes that style, industry and theme index products will be the mainstream of index funds in 2010. In the competitive development pattern of traditional index funds and ETFs, ETFs will gain an advantage this year, mainly because the connected fund has opened up the bank channel of ETFs. For the most innovative分级基金, due to its own leverage characteristics, ability to meet the细分需求 of different investors, and the existence of multiple trading strategies, it has attracted a lot of market attention. Wang Feng, the deputy general manager of Guolian\\'an Fund Company, said, \"Compared with the homogenization phenomenon of domestic existing fund products,分级 funds re-divide the risk and return of funds through their unique fund profit distribution system, establish a leveraged effect, and fill the gap in the investment demand for high returns or stable returns.\" According to the information obtained by the journalists from several companies, there are as many as five分级基金, including bond分级基金, which are currently being prepared in a hurry. In addition, for the QDII fund to go overseas again, three new products, namely, the CHT NASDAQ 100 Index, ICBC R&Q Global Select, and Changsheng Global Industry Large Cap, have already been issued. Guo Taishang Securities fund analyst Wu Tianyu said that passive investment and cross-border ETFs will be the new features of QDII products this year. It is reported that there are already several QDII index products in preparation in the current market. Among them, Penghua Fund has been authorized to develop ETF products for six indices under MSCI, and Boti Fund has also obtained the authorization to develop SPDR S&P 500 Cross-border ETF. Innovation breakthroughs require multi-angle solutions, but at the same time, as innovative products gradually move towards the \"deep water zone\", fund companies are faced with a series of problems such as declining industry profit margins, increasing difficulty in issuing new funds, and fund holders redeeming old funds to buy new ones. According to the recent research report of Everbright Securities, since the birth of open-end funds in China, open-end funds first appeared in negative cash flow record in 2009. Net redemptions of open-end funds in 2009 were 358.8 billion yuan, dividends were 73 billion yuan, and various operating expenses were 38.1 billion yuan. Considering the issuance of 347 billion yuan in new funds, the cash outflow reached 123 billion yuan. Although the issuance of new funds last year smoothed the impact of net redemptions to a large extent, the fund industry in China was still in a net redemption state from the perspective of shares. Market analysts believe that the main reason for the current dilemma of fund industry in expanding its market share is \"single product\" and \"single channel\". Looking at the current fund market, although there are hundreds of funds with a wide variety of names, the basic models and types are basically the same, which is out of line with market demand. Market segmentation is inadequate, and the market potential cannot be fully tapped. A large number of similar \"concepts\" have reduced the market\\'s enthusiasm for investing in funds. At the same time, the sales channels of funds are not diversified enough. During peak times, bank channels are too congested, and it is impossible to market every fund being issued \"to the best of our ability.\" As a result, the sales of fund products cannot be achieved \"fairly\" and \"fully.\" \"A bank financial advisor said.\" Recently, at the China Securities Investment Fund Annual Conference, Liu Xiaoyan, the vice president of E Fund, said, \"This year, the sales of funds are particularly difficult, and the reason is not that there are too many products, but that the products are too similar, and there are not many innovative products provided to customers.\" Zhang Dong, the deputy general manager of the retail banking department of China Merchants Bank, believes that \"the market has demand, and if we can develop the products that customers need, the sales of funds are not difficult. For example, the fund under the custody of Yinhua Fund was sold out 4.8 billion yuan on the day of fundraising, and the proportional allocation was finally launched.\" Jiang Yingkun, the head of financial engineering at Guotai Junan Securities, analyzed that in the future, the field of fund innovation may mainly develop in three directions: First, with the introduction of margin trading and short selling and stock index futures, the strategy space for fund product innovation has been fully opened. There are many innovations that can be done in the combination of stock index futures and ETFs; second, there will be innovations in the trading methods of funds. In particular, if funds introduce stock index futures for liquidity management in the future, the turnover rate will be further reduced, and the corresponding investment cost will also be reduced; third, the structure of fund products will gradually become more reasonable, and the innovative methods of guaranteed and leveraged funds will continue to deepen. In fact, in order to promote the development of the fund industry, the regulatory authorities are making unremitting efforts to promote the innovation of fund products. In the fund classification approval, the regulatory authorities have opened a green channel for innovative products, which has accelerated the approval speed of innovative products this year. Xu Ming, the deputy general manager of the SSE, said previously that the SSE has agreed to allow fund companies to develop cross-border ETFs that track overseas indices, and all preparations for the technical system, back-end services, and other aspects are basically ready. The relevant person in charge of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange said that the Shenzhen Stock Exchange will focus on promoting the development of funds on the exchange platform from three directions: internationalization, indexation, and structuring. The cake of the fund market is expected to be expanded by innovation as a \"ferment\". In addition, from the current innovation fund products, most of the products belong to the in-market funds traded on the exchange. Analysts point out that the variety of trading varieties of in-market funds, relatively low trading fees, and the rapid and convenient trading methods make in-market funds have great appeal; the innovation of in-market trading funds can also effectively broaden the sales channels of multiple funds such as securities firms, alleviate the phenomenon of fund congestion and concentrated issuance, and make fund sales more thorough and effective. The road to innovation is not smooth, and stock index futures add new weight. At present, it seems that the road to innovation in fund products is not smooth. A fund researcher pointed out that fund investors are the demand side of fund products, and are the fundamental force driving the development and innovation of fund products; in the current A-share market, investors often turn long-term needs into short-term ones, and pursue funds with better short-term performance with the changes of market hotspots; therefore, in the future, the innovation of fund products should focus on both investor education and new product development and design. Wang Qunhang, a fund analyst of Galaxy Securities, pointed out that, influenced by the successful issuance of Changsheng Tongqing in May last year, some fund companies, after nearly a year of preparation, finally issued分级 funds with more innovative components. Nevertheless, these new product launches, which were expected to be more successful, did not fare well, as theoretically there was no way to address the discounting of the weighted yield after listing. Worse still, some fund companies\\' marketing personnel may have a limited understanding of such products, and there may be a risk of misleading investors in marketing and promotion. Currently, the stock index futures have been successfully launched, and have introduced some new operational strategies to the horizon of fund managers. Dr. Jiang Yingkun told the press that in recent days, the number of inquiries from fund companies about index futures has increased significantly. The concern of public funds for hedging has been increasing, and the number of companies paying attention has also increased. For dedicated account business, the focus of fund companies is mainly on arbitrage strategies and trading systems, and some companies even exchanged whether they should set up special traders for index futures. In addition, according to a securities firm research institute, other fund companies, including Fosun, Dacheng, and Taeda Hongli, are also actively preparing for dedicated account products that will be linked to stock index futures. Gu Gaixin, the executive director of the financial engineering department of Dacheng Fund, said that in the early stage of the introduction of stock index futures, they would prefer to launch hedging products with sufficient confidence, relatively simple structure, and clear strategies; after a period of normal operation of the stock index futures market, Dacheng Fund will use actual market data to test all the work of Dacheng Fund. When the arbitrage model can ensure the effective operation, the system efficiency, work process and personnel quality can indeed match the arbitrage requirements, and the market environment such as liquidity can also meet the arbitrage needs, Dacheng Fund will launch such products.']\n"

      "['王利敏,杨晓坤', '正向', \"End-of-day plunge could not change the mild adjustment pattern⊙Shi Ji Investment Wang Limin⊙Editor Yang Xiaokun The major market saw a scene of end-of-day plunge yesterday, with the Shanghai market approaching 2,600 points in a short period of time. However, after the多方最后20分钟的拉抬, the market only fell 17 points at the end of the day, and from the perspective of the number of stocks rising and falling, 422:441, repeatedly relying on end-of-day plunge is clearly difficult to change the basic pattern of the mild adjustment of the major market. The market fell at the end of the day, despite the strong performance of the surrounding markets such as the US stock market overnight. The weakness of the real estate and other heavyweights has made the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets mostly in the green trading, especially the overall decline of the real estate, financial, steel, non-ferrous metals, and coal, which made the white line representing the index look very weak during the trading day. But what is intriguing is that the yellow line, which represents small and medium-sized stocks and non-cap stocks, has been rising repeatedly. In contrast to the collective weakness of the heavyweights, the main board market was active in the pharmaceutical, commercial, alcoholic beverages, agriculture, tourism, and military industries, and the small and medium-sized board and the growth enterprise market, which had been underwhelming in the past, have regained strength. Although the Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, the SME Board Index and the Growth Enterprise Market Index were both above the 5-day moving average. It is interesting that the Shanghai market might have closed in the green without the real estate sector after 2:00 PM and the continuous plunge of the CSI 300 Index. The bearish strategy is clearly similar to the one used on Tuesday, when the market plunged at the end of the day on the rumor of bad news. So, repeatedly using the closing price to kill the market actually indicates that the bearish side lacks confidence. Several reasons why adjustments are inevitable after a prolonged one-sided advance in the major indices, and the reasons are more than sufficient. First, the major market continues to force an empty market, causing the technical face to be severely overbought and requiring adjustment. One is that the upward slope is too steep, which is not conducive to the continuation of the trend. To adjust the slope, a consolidation process is needed. The second is that a large number of technical indicators are severely dulled or have too large a deviation, and a correction is needed. Next, many heavyweights such as real estate have adjusted and consolidated their strength during this round of the market, with significant gains already. In this sense, the active performance of many non-mainstream sectors and small and medium-sized board and创业板 stocks when the major sectors adjusted yesterday just filled the lack of market hotspots. Also, the Everbright Bank is about to issue and list, and a series of new macroeconomic data will be released, and the market also has the willingness to wait. After the light industry bank and the relevant data have landed smoothly, it is obviously more advantageous to attack again. Moreover, since this round of market rally adopted a squeeze short position approach, a large number of investors (including institutions) are in an awkward situation of being squeezed short. A pullback of the market index would be conducive to winning more bullish forces. Gentle adjustments are likely to be a repeat of the previous day's closing plunge, which makes the market break below the 5-day moving average and then further break below the 10-day moving average, making the adjustment trend more evident, leading to greater divergence in the market's view on the way of adjustment. Let's analyze them one by one. The first method is a gentle adjustment, carried out in a horizontal range with small bullish and bearish candles. Then one possibility is to go long on the right shoulder of the head and shoulders bottom, and then rise after a period of consolidation; another possibility is to wait for the 20-day moving average to rise and then attack again after a short consolidation. The second method is a consolidation, forming a second low point, and then rising again, similar to the attack from 2639 points to 3068 points in early September last year, followed by a decline to 2712 points, and then another attack, forming a trend of continuously raising the low point and continuously raising the high point. The third scenario is that the upward trend ends here and retests the low point of 2319, which may even create a new low. I think the third possibility can be ruled out for now, at least, as there is no sign of it. Of the first two possibilities, we tend to favor the first. So, whether it is a head and shoulders bottom or a slight consolidation before another attack, it should be a good opportunity for those who missed the current trend or have too light a position to buy at a low price.\"]\n"

Beijing Examination News (Reporter An Jingjing) The college entrance examination self-recruitment outline has been issued in succession. Talented candidates are preparing to apply for the ideal colleges and universities they dream of. Admissions Office officials reminded candidates that when submitting award materials for autonomous recruitment selection, they only need to provide certificates from the high school stage and above the provincial level. In the past, some candidates would copy all the certificates of awards from various competitions they had participated in since primary school to prove that they were indeed excellent and send them to the school. Mu Lin, director of the Z North Forestry University admissions office, said that such application materials are too cumbersome and are not conducive to the admissions office teachers seeing at a glance the strengths of the student. Applicants should attach only the materials that best reflect their strengths and the main achievements of their high school years. Awards from junior high or primary school are not valid and need not be provided. At the same time, all the required documents specified in the prospectus must be prepared and bound together when submitting the application materials. The relevant person in charge of the ZBJU Admissions Office introduced that the school requires candidates to fill in the \"Application Basis\" item when registering online, and candidates should summarize and list according to their own award-winning situation and specialties, etc. The registration basis must be representative and provide convincing evidence. If there are awards that meet the priority conditions, they must be filled in the \"main application basis\", and at the same time, in the award situation, the candidates should fill in the specific time and award situation. Since it takes some time to mail written materials, candidates are advised not to apply online just before the deadline, as this will reduce the chances of passing the preliminary review.']\n"

However, the negotiations for Li Weifeng’s transfer to Wuhan are still at an impasse. And this deadlock originated from a decision change by the Shanghai Shenhua top management within 24 hours. In fact, Wuhan\\'s earliest plan to introduce Li Weifeng to Shanghai Shenhua was a half-year plus one-year scheme of first loan and then transfer. For this plan, the upper management of Shanghai Shenhua and Wuhan club basically agreed. According to the insiders, the general idea of this plan is as follows: Wuhan will first borrow Li Weifeng for half a year, with a fee of 280,000, and a formal transfer next year, with a transfer fee of about 2 million RMB. It is understood that the oral agreement reached between the relevant director of Shanghai Shenhua and Wuhan was originally responsible for the negotiation of this plan, but Shanghai Shenhua still apologized to Wuhan within less than 24 hours, and ultimately rejected this negotiation content. They have rejected the terms they offered us previously. I do not understand why Shanghai Shenhua Club refused such a generous transfer contract. The Wuhan club’s general manager, Xu Zhiqiang, who had never negotiated with the Shanghai Shenhua club, was clearly unaware of the high-level negotiation skills of the Shanghai Shenhua club in player transfer negotiations. Previously, the negotiations between Shanghai Shenhua and Xi\\'an for the introduction of a midfielder from Shanghai Shenhua were overturned within 24 hours of the initial agreement, and ultimately led to the announcement that the negotiations had failed. And Wang Ke\\'s transfer negotiations between Shanghai Shenhua and Beijing Guoan were also full of ups and downs, with a deadlock, and finally succeeded under the compromise policies such as Beijing Guoan changing the negotiating person in charge. It is said that Shanghai Shenhua insists on \"leasing but not transferring\" at present, but Shanghai Shenhua has still offered preferential conditions to Wuhan in the transfer negotiations next year: if this loan is successful, Shanghai Shenhua is willing to note in the loan contract that Wuhan has the right of first refusal for Li Weifeng next year. It is said that for the transfer fee, Shanghai Shenhua will start to negotiate from 5 million yuan, and it is impossible to be the price of the previous half a year. This is normal, after all, next year is the transfer fee for a year. \"']\n"

      "['王雅楠,梁先生,李先生,涂谨申', '正向', 'Hong Kong man finds HK$2.4 million in a bag left in the car by a passenger and returns it to the finder South China Morning Post reporter Wang Yanan reported from Hong Kong A Hong Kong taxi driver found a bag left in the car by a passenger and opened it to find 2.4 million HK dollars. The taxi driver hurriedly handed the money over to the Wan Chai police station. To my surprise, three months later, the owner had not been found, and no one claimed the 2.4 million yuan! Under Hong Kong civil law, if the police fail to find the owner within a reasonable time, the property will belong to the finder, and this news has become a hot topic of discussion on Hong Kong\\'s major forums. Police: Reviewing the closed-circuit television footage did not find the owner. Yesterday, Nanfang Daily reporters verified this matter with the Hong Kong police. According to the police, in late May this year, a man reported to the police that he found a handbag in the taxi he was driving, which contained a large amount of cash. Upon receiving the report, the police officer learned that it involved a large sum of money, and immediately reported to the superior and recorded in detail the taxi driver\\'s finding of cash. The police made an initial count and found that there were as much as HK$2.4 million in cash in the bag, and some receipts from a casino in Macau in the pocket. The Hong Kong police said that they had actively traced the identity of the owner after receiving the taxi driver\\'s report, including checking the closed-circuit television and even querying the Macao casino, but the other party replied that \"no staff had reported losing money recently.\" And checking the computer records, no one reported the loss of 2.4 million yuan. When the taxi driver handed over the bag to the police, the police issued a receipt for the property according to the relevant procedures after counting the amount. According to the Hong Kong police convention, if no one claims the property within the specified period and the finder wishes to claim it, the police will notify the finder to go to the police station to collect the property. The driver originally thought that the \"careless person\" would report the police to chase the money if he lost a huge sum of money. Three months after the taxi driver reported the case, he called the police station to confirm whether anyone had claimed it. To my surprise, I was told that the case was still under investigation. This matter has caused a great response in Hong Kong, and many people are curious about the origin of this money. Mr. Leung, a taxi driver, does not believe that no one claims this 2.4 million Hong Kong dollars, and he suspects that there is something wrong with the origin of this money. Drivers\\' hot discussion: found items are common, but not daring to keep them. According to Hong Kong law, obtaining items illegally is a crime. Therefore, citizens tend to turn lost property over to the police. Passengers sometimes leave their belongings in a taxi. Yesterday, Nanrui reporters randomly interviewed several Hong Kong taxi drivers, who believed that finding a large sum of money was like \"winning the lottery\", but they were not brave enough to keep it privately. Over the six years of driving, I have also picked up many things and handed them over to the police station every time. I learned later that they were all returned to the owners, which made me feel very relieved. Driver Mr. Liang admitted that keeping lost property is a good atmosphere that should start from oneself, so that Hong Kong can form a good atmosphere. It\\'s no fun for anyone when something is lost. And Mr. Li, the taxi driver, joked that he once found an iPhone 4, which he handed over to the police, but was unable to find the owner, and later used it for his children at home. He said, \"Everyone at home was surprised, but it\\'s better to hand it over to the police for investigation first, and it will be much more reassuring to use.\" If there is no owner after three months, the lost property will be given to the finder. The discussion on this case focuses on the relevant Hong Kong laws that allow the finder to keep the lost property. Legislative Council legal sector member Tuk Kam-shing said that the arrangements for handling lost property are civil laws. If the police are unable to find the owner within a reasonable time, the property will be returned to the finder. Generally, three months are allowed, but if it involves valuable property, it can also be accepted beyond three months. The Police also set out the procedures for handling found property in the Police General Orders, and stipulate that anyone who hands found property to a police station shall be issued a receipt for the property, and both the original and copy of the receipt shall also indicate whether the finder intends to claim the property after the designated period. If it is intended to do so, the police must notify the finder to go to the police station to claim it, and the responsible police officer and the finder must sign to confirm on the report. In addition, according to Hong Kong law, if items are found at the airport, MTR, or public buses, even if they are handed over to the police and no one claims them, the lost items do not belong to the finder, but are handled by the Airport Authority, MTR, and bus companies.

Sina Sports News  The match against Denmark was the first shot of the Dutch team in this World Cup. This match was even more memorable for the veteran captain, Van Bronckhorst, who made his 100th official appearance for the Netherlands. Among the Dutch team of \"Dream Tulip\", Van Bronckhorst, the 35-year-old veteran captain, is not dazzling, but he is definitely the most experienced player in major events. He has participated in two World Cups and two European Cups, and he has already represented the national team in more than 100 matches. He is the iron wall of the Dutch team\\'s left flank. An old hand is as good as a treasure, though Van Bronckhorst has reached the age of 35, he still made outstanding contributions in both attack and defense in this match. His abundant energy and good physical condition even surprised the head coach, Frank de Boer: \"Gio is never the most eye-catching, but he is the most important link in the team.\" Van Bronckhorst started his career at Feyenoord, a club in the Netherlands, and then played for Glasgow Rangers, Arsenal, and Barcelona. One could say that Van Bronckhorst was lucky, as he won almost all club honors in 17 years. This includes two consecutive championships of the Scottish Premier League in the 98-99 and 99-00 seasons as a representative of the Stray Dog team; after transferring to Arsenal, he led the team to win the Premier League championship in the 01-02 season, and then won the FA Cup championship twice in the following two years; in the peak of his career, he transferred to Barcelona, and won the La Liga championship for two consecutive seasons in the 04-05 and 05-06 seasons, and in 2006, he stood at the pinnacle of Europe, representing Barcelona to win the UEFA Champions League. But Van Bronckhorst was also unlucky, as the “uncrowned king” of the Dutch national team, he had never tasted the World Cup or European Cup, and this year’s South Africa World Cup will be Van Bronckhorst’s last chance. Since first wearing the orange jersey of the national team in 1996, Van Bronckhorst has made 100 appearances for the Netherlands national team and scored 5 goals in 15 years. But heroes must eventually bow out, and after this World Cup, Van Bronckhorst will officially retire from the national team: \"This departure is the end of a chapter in my life, but I do not want to end my time at Feyenoord. At the end of my career, I hope to shine in South Africa, and I will do my best to work with my teammates and coaches to bring the World Cup back to the Netherlands. That was a perfect ending! \"(Chen Chi)\"']\n"

      "['杜小鹏', '正向', 'Mastering three key points, getting a 9 in IELTS listening is not difficult. On the morning of May 22, I was in front of the computer, watching the IELTS score website, refreshing the screen over and over again, hoping to see the results of my IELTS test on May 9 as soon as possible. Around 8 o\\'clock, the website finally showed the information \"Total score: 7.5 Listening: 9 Reading: 8.5 Writing: 6 Speaking: 7\". A heart that hung in the air finally landed. Such results, although they fall short of one\\'s expectations, are still quite gratifying. Looking back at the preparation process for the IELTS, the journey has not been smooth. Here, I mainly want to share my experience of the IELTS test and English learning with you, hoping to be of help to you and help you avoid taking the wrong path. Overall, the IELTS test is a test of ability level, which tests the examinees\\' ability to use English, that is, a complete language structure. The value of language is reflected in its ability to convey and exchange information, which is mainly manifested in the four basic skills of \"listening/speaking/reading/writing\" in daily life. Therefore, in order to achieve ideal results in the IELTS test, it is necessary to comprehensively improve the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, and none of the four basic skills can be neglected. And this also reflects the scientific and rigorous nature of the IELTS test from another perspective, while ensuring the reliability and validity of the IELTS test. Specifically, the four basic abilities tested in the IELTS examination can be divided into two major categories, one of which is the language input category, including listening and reading, and the other is the language output category, including speaking and writing. Two different categories of abilities determine that the preparation process will be somewhat different. The language input section, which includes listening and reading, essentially requires candidates to reprocess the given information and express it in another way. There are techniques for various question types, and New航道 teachers have already organized and summarized these techniques, so that every candidate can easily master them and flexibly respond to the exam. In terms of listening, as Mr. Du Xiaopeng said, \"The listening part of the IELTS test examines three aspects: question type, rhythm, and vocabulary.\" Three at the same time, at the same time, may not be as difficult as the other subjects, but it requires speed and a strong sense of rhythm. Master these three points, and the listening problems of the IELTS exam will be solved effortlessly. And the graceful demeanor of the listening teacher also makes the whole class fall in love, making the process of acquiring knowledge twice as effective. As for reading, the teacher summarized the four elements of IELTS reading: first, vocabulary; second, understanding of grammar question types; third, understanding of the question types of the exam and having good solving skills; fourth, having a wide range of reading. If candidates prepare thoroughly according to these four points, an excellent IELTS score is just around the corner. Another thing to add is that you will really regret it if you don\\'t experience the humorous and witty teaching style of the teacher. The language output section, which includes speaking and writing, essentially requires candidates to apply their knowledge to solve a variety of problems. Most Chinese candidates are awed by these two exams. In fact, teachers have also prepared various effective countermeasures for candidates long ago. For example, the speaking courses taught by the spoken language teachers fully consider all kinds of situations that may be encountered in the IELTS speaking test, and analyze and comment on them one by one, so that every part of the speaking test and every topic can be fully understood and perfectly mastered by the examinees. And her passionate speech greatly boosted her classmates\\' confidence. As for the writing class, the writing teacher will break down all the types of writing tests, explain them in detail, and apply the \"imitation\" method according to the natural laws of language learning, so that students can quickly improve their English writing level in a short time. It is worth emphasizing that in the IELTS test, the ability assessment of language input and the ability assessment of language output are all within the framework of assessing English ability, and they are interrelated and mutually promoting. They should not be put in opposition to each other. Finally, the motto to be shared is: \"I will persist until I succeed\". It was this new airway\\'s motto that accompanied me through nearly 100 days and nights of preparation for the IELTS exam. May all of you who are still fighting for the IELTS exam have a successful exam! For more information, please visit: Sina IELTS channel, IELTS forum, IELTS blog circle. Special notice: Due to the continuous adjustment and change of various aspects, all the examination information provided by Sina.com is for reference only, and candidates are advised to refer to the officially published information by the competent authority.']\n"

Recently, the American magazine Prevention listed 10 common physical signals to help you predict your health condition. 1. Finger length. British scholars have found that women with shorter ring fingers than index fingers have twice the incidence of knee osteoarthritis as ordinary people. Males with this feature have lower levels of estrogen and are also more prone to developing arthritis. Prevention: exercise the muscles in the knee area. Sit with your legs parallel to the ground and extend 10 times, holding each for 5-10 seconds. 2. Height. The research of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States found that women taller than 1.58 meters have a small chance of living to 100. Preventive measures: regular life, quit smoking and limit alcohol, eat less meat. 3. Long legs. British scholars have found that people with leg lengths between 0.5 and 0.7 meters have higher levels of enzymes in their blood that cause liver disease. Preventive measures: avoid exposure to chemicals, wear masks and gloves when working in contaminated areas, and strictly control alcohol consumption. 4. Olfaction. If elderly people cannot clearly distinguish the smell of food such as bananas, cinnamon, and lemons, their risk of developing Parkinson's disease within four years will increase by 5 times. Prevention: Consume more fish rich in omega-3. 5. Arm length. A study by Tufts University in the United States found that women with short arms are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease than women with long arms. Prevention: Cultivating hobbies such as painting can reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease by 2.5 times. 6. Earlobe crease. People with wrinkles on their earlobes are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Both ears have creases, with a 77% risk of disease. Preventive measures: weight loss, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 7. Belly. A recent study in the journal Neurology found that middle-aged people with a large belly have 3.6 times the risk of developing dementia at the age of 70. Prevention: Eating more olive oil, nuts, and dark chocolate can eliminate visceral fat accumulation. 8. Size of the chest. The Canadian Medical Association Journal published a study that found that young women who wear D-cup bras have 1.5 times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who wear A-cup bras over a 10-year period. Prevention: Increase exercise intensity. Those who do 6 sprints of 30 seconds on the treadmill have 25% higher ability to metabolize blood glucose. 9. Length of the lower leg. French scholars have found that women with a tibia length of less than 0.33 meters are more likely to develop carotid plaques and increase the risk of stroke. Prevention: drink more green tea. People who drink 5 cups of green tea every day have the lowest incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. 10. Blood type. Harvard Medical School research found that people with blood types A, B, and AB have a 44% higher chance of developing pancreatic cancer than people with blood type O. Prevention: eat more low-fat dairy products or fish, and take vitamin D. People who consume 300 international units of vitamin D daily have a 44% lower incidence of pancreatic cancer. ▲(Guo Chuan Feng)\"]\n"

Online report (Reporter Wang Zhiming): On October 31, the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs launched a black campaign called \"Morava\" across the country, arresting more than 500 black gang members and seizing large quantities of drugs, weapons, ammunition, counterfeit money, and stolen cars. Dacic, the minister of the interior, told the press after the operation that more than 2,000 interior ministry police had been involved, and that 600 locations across the country had been raided.

Dacic said that during the operation, 5 kg of marijuana and some heroin, as well as 57 weapons of various types, more than 20 stolen cars, and over 1.5 million dollars in counterfeit money were seized. In addition, six fugitive suspects were also arrested. Dacic said that the operation received strong support from the judiciary in all regions. Serbia is actively seeking to join the EU. In order to meet the requirements of the EU, Serbia must combat various criminal forces and improve social security while revising and perfecting various laws. In particular, the EU has committed to abolishing the visa regime for citizens of Serbia visiting EU countries at the beginning of next year, which gives a specific meaning to the anti-gang operations of the Serbian Ministry of the Interior across the country.']\n"

Sina Tech News, November 4 afternoon news, in less than a day, Sina Tech News on the dispute between Tencent and 360, more than 1.45 million people have voted. Nearly 80% of users believe that both companies neglect the interests of users for private gain. The user data analysis shows that the single area with the most votes is Guangdong Province. The dispute between Tencent and 360, which escalated in the afternoon of the previous day, quickly became the focus of netizens\\' attention. Within less than a day, Sina Technology conducted a vote on this matter, and more than 1.45 million people have voted. In one of the surveys, the voters were asked to answer how they viewed the dispute between Tencent and 360. In this survey, more than 79% of the participants chose the option \"Both companies for their own benefit, without considering the interests of users\", and the number of votes for this option also exceeded one million. Another 13.5% of the users did not express a clear opinion. This morning, 360 announced the shutdown of the Keduobao download and its official page after the announcement last night. This morning, 360 popped up a window to recall the Keduobao software to users, asking them to uninstall the product, and provided a link to uninstall the software directly in the pop-up window. In the survey designed by Sina Tech, more than 60% of the voters said they would not uninstall Koudou Baojie. From the analysis of the users, it can be seen that the number of people from Guangdong in the users who participated in both surveys is more than 12%, becoming the largest single source of votes. The number of netizens from Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Hubei, Fujian, Henan and other provinces and regions account for half of the entire vote. The clash between 360 and Tencent reached its climax last night, from Tencent\\'s announcement that it would stop running QQ on computers with 360 software, to 360\\'s removal of the QQ Shield and sending an urgent appeal to users. This intense exchange, which lasted for five hours, attracted strong attention from both inside and outside the industry, and also became the most popular entertainment topic among netizens in recent years.

      "['阿里扎,巴蒂尔,船长,克星,斯蒂芬-杰克逊,杰克逊,莫雷,布鲁克斯,斯科拉,洛瑞,阿泰斯特', '负向', \"Ariza was completely defeated by the captain's champion team, and such people are needed. Rockets arrived in Charlotte today to play against the Bobcats, who are known as the strong team's bane. The Rockets maintained a double-digit lead throughout the first half, but were taken over by their opponents in the third quarter and ultimately lost to them 94-102. Of course, the Rockets' loss this time is related to the excellent performance of the captain Stephen Jackson, who has played the best game of his career, scoring 43 points and 8 rebounds, and setting a new record for the highest single-game score in his career. With Battier and Ariza, two top-notch defenders, on the team, the Rockets still let Stephen Jackson humiliate the entire Rockets team alone, and it is beyond doubt that he bears the greatest responsibility for the loss in this game. Ariza scored 19 points, grabbed 6 rebounds and made 4 assists in the whole game, shooting 7 of 16, 2 of 6 from three-point line and 3 of 6 from the free-throw line. Battier scored 10 points and grabbed 3 rebounds in 39 minutes, shooting 30% from the field and 28.6% from three-point range. The combined score of the two players was 14 points lower than Stephen Jackson, but the real difference was not these 14 points, but the difference in temperament. And this defeat once again proves that this Rockets team still lacks a true leader. Stephen Jackson compares Battier and Ariza, with an extra bit of thug, which is the biggest difference between the two and the Rockets' small forwards. Stephen Jackson may not be a top small forward in the league in terms of ability, but he is confident, determined, dares to make moves, and is very bold. In the first three quarters, the Bobcats were almost relying on him alone. When手感 is not good, Stephen Jackson would choose to use penetration to create damage. Note that Jackson's breakthrough is different from Ariza's, as he will go straight to the opponent when there is an opponent in front of him to get a free throw opportunity. In the whole game, he went to the free throw line 11 times and made 10 of them. And Ariza's movements were more about dodging, which is not to say that Ariza is soft, but you can't help but say that this is indeed a sign of a lack of confidence. Jackson's thug nature became the key to winning or losing during the stalemate between the two teams. During the stalemate in the fourth quarter, the Rockets passed the offensive opportunity to Ariza for a one-on-one, while the Hornets passed the ball to Jackson to execute the offense. Starting from the 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter, in the following 6 offensive plays, Stephen Jackson scored 5 times, and the only failure was when Battier committed an offensive foul, but Jackson soon forced Battier to foul and went to the free throw line to regain his face. On the contrary, Ariza has none of Stephen Jackson’s style on the Rockets. He was hesitant with the ball in his hands, forcing his way through, wanting to go to his back to single-handedly play, but it was obvious that he was at a loss. Consecutive failures in the offensive game also affected Ariza's defensive performance, and an unnecessary interference shot gave the opponent two points. In just 5 minutes, the Rockets were outscored by the Bobcats 13-2, going from a 5-point lead to a 6-point deficit, and never recovered. Ariza's weakness has been fully exposed in this period. He lacks a strong heart and the belief in victory. Morey, the Rockets' general manager, once said that he expected Ariza to make a leap, from a role player to a first-line star, but now it seems that not only is his technique not ready, but his psychology is also not ready. Stephen Jackson may not be a top-tier star in terms of ability, but his yearning for victory, belief, and determination certainly have the temperament of a winner. Why he could lead the team to create the miracle of Black Eight and eliminate the Mavericks in the Warriors, this is also a key reason. The current Rockets are short of such players,阿里扎 is not, Barea is not, Brooks is not, Skora has such temperament, but his physical condition and playing style limit his role. Loroy also has such temperament, but like Skora, his physical condition and technical limitations restrict his influence. The Rockets have too many good kids and they need a player with the attitude of Artest or Stephen Jackson to invigorate the team. It was a pity that Stephen Jackson had once expressed his willingness to join the Rockets before he transferred to the Bobcats, but the Rockets missed such an opportunity. There won't be only good boys in a champion team, and the Rockets are now missing such a person.

After the hit TV series \"Soldier\\'s Strengh\", the actor Xing Jiadong, who played Wu Liuyi, was familiar to the audience. Several years later, Xing Jiadong had performed well in several popular TV series, and his nicknames began to increase, such as \"Teacher Commander\", \"Office Commander\", \"Commander\", and \"Xiangso\". Say goodbye to 2010 and let\\'s look back at the beautiful memories Xing Jiadong brought to you. The most resolute - Wu Liu Yi of \"Soldier\\'s Strenth\". The popularity of \"Soldier\\'s Strenth\" has made a team famous, and the six words \"never give up\" have been engraved in people\\'s hearts. And the soldier called \"Wu Liu Yi\" has also been engraved in our hearts. Xing Jiadong endows Wu Liuyi with a resolute soul, and Wu Liuyi endows Xing Jiadong with a dazzling halo. Life is short, it\\'s hard not to encounter something difficult, always complaining, why me, always hesitating, how should I do. I think Wu Liuyi was not so at ease in his heart. He knew that staying in the army as a quartermaster, he could also live a long life with 4,000 calories of energy per person per day, with his uniform and his dream together, never leaving each other. But Wu Li yi put down his weapon and said that he chose to leave. Wu Liuyi never complained. He had no complaints about anything or anyone. He walked his own path. No matter how difficult, painful, wasted, or hard it is, he is Wu Lu Yi, and he can still walk on bravely. Most sincere - Gao Quan in \"The March of the Volunteers\" tells me what loyalty and firmness are in \"The March of the Volunteers\". When we were young and reckless, we would make a big mistake for a small matter. If we had not caught Gao Quan\\'s comrade-in-arms, Gao Quan might have crossed the border for a photo of a former girlfriend. Perhaps for him, it was not just a picture, but also his lost youth and first love. Xing Jiadong\\'s eyes are as clear as a child\\'s, and you can see his sincerity and his dedication through the roles he plays. After the trials and growth, Gao Quan, the young talent, proved the old saying that a tiger father has no dog son. Standing in front of Daxianshan, he was not ashamed to be the son of the commander. He was killed in front of the boundary marker, and he was not ashamed to be a Chinese soldier. Gao Quan taught us with his life that nothing can be an excuse for making mistakes. Some things simply cannot be done, not even if one dies trying. Gao Quan understood this. We began to understand at the moment the tears fell. The most tolerant - When \"Snow Crystal\" was broadcast, I roared along with the audience watching the drama, Xing Jiadong is so handsome. Alright, Pu Ming is really something to describe with beauty, young, handsome, elegant, like a willow tree in the wind, elegant but not lewd. Xing Jiadong can always amplify the brilliance of his characters when choosing roles. We learn from Puming\\'s magnanimity in accommodating others. Of course, Puming\\'s meticulousness and quick thinking are also his strengths, but I admire his magnanimity more. Li Ke indeed has some talent, but he acts impulsively and often oversteps his bounds. It takes a great man to tolerate such a capable person. Tolerance is an inner temperament that cannot be put on. It must come from the heart. There must be something in the heart to overflow. Struggle the most - Yu Xiaqing in \"My Commander, My Regiment\" Yu Xiaqing, a proud person to the bone, who would rather break than bend. This is what Gao Cheng said to Wu Liu Yi. Looking at Yu Xiaqing, I began to believe in the concept of past life and present life. Such a Yu Xiaqing, a talent reared in the slow simmering of a scholarly family; such a Yu Xiaqing, a king\\'s demeanor forged in the blood of war. Better to break than to bend. Better to lose than to retreat. Better to die than to repent. Yet, often fate plays tricks on people, and he has to face everything one by one. If he could be a little more indulgent, he would have crossed the river, and if he could be a little more cowardly, he would have risked his life. It is much harder to choose to let go than to choose to pick up, and I only realized this much later. I always feel that Xu Xiaqing is a better role for Xing Jiadong than Wu Liuyi. His brilliance is beyond the control of a small class monitor, and no matter how he is restrained, he can only say that he is young and has not yet formed a climate. However, what kind of demeanor, depth, and magnanimity, and firmness, did Yu Xiaoxing, in his thirties, need? All of these were given to Yu Xiaoxing by Xing Jiadong, while only pride was given to Xing Jiadong by Yu Xiaoxing. The most perfect - Zheng Yan in \"Foggy Flowers\" is the role that is closest to Xing Jiadong himself. He looks reserved and calm on the outside, but there is a little bit of wildness in his heart. A man who drives a Cherokee is not likely to be a person with a very soft heart. However, goodness and honesty are the same, I don\\'t think Zheng Yan is too good, I believe there are such people in life, \"you have not met, does not prove that there are no such people, I have seen such people.\" These words were said by Xing Jiadong himself. I think Zheng Yan is a person who can make people feel sunny in their hearts. He can\\'t compare to those inspirational figures, but he always tells you that your eyes are black and your heart is red, and you can\\'t see benefits and your eyes are red and your heart is black. This is of great importance to us who are just getting by in today\\'s society. We should know what is doable and what is not, so that we can often gain more than just peace of mind. Most shocking - \"Red Rock in Flames\". Du Yingshan, Xing Jiadong, played too many good people. After the broadcast of \"Red Rock in Flames\", it overturned the audience\\'s impression of him. That sinister smile and ruthless means of a Nationalist official turned out to be played by Xing Jiadong. You will never see Wu Liuyi or Yu Xiaoxing again, he is no longer Xing Jiadong, he is just a demonized mad executioner who has returned to history. Du Yingshan, with his outstanding performance, has been highly favored by the party and the country. He returned from studying abroad, well-read in literature, with a smooth official career and a bright future. Xing Jiadong said, \"Du Yingshan is a soldier, he has his own faith, he can\\'t think of himself as a bad person, he must think that all the things he did were right.\" Du Yingshan detested torture the most, and he believed that it was the least technologically advanced method. If other means could solve the problem, there was no need to cause a death. Of course, the Communists\\' determination often exceeded Du Yinshan\\'s imagination, and he only resorted to torture when he had no choice. The most powerful - \"Qiao Longbiao\" Qiao Longbiao, perhaps every boy would imagine that he could ride a horse and fight and become a hero when he was young. Qiao Longbiao, this towering and flesh-and-blood great hero, was played by Xing Jiadong. Qiao Longbiao’s generosity and loyalty made him the most powerful person, what could be more unforgettable than such a hero. Xing Jiadong suffered a lot and got some injuries when filming Qiaolongbiao, but he never mentioned these things. His mind was always on the play and the characters, and those other things seemed to have nothing to do with him. Chang Longbiao, riding a white horse, galloped through the storm, leaving many people in awe. Some netizens jokingly said, \"The one riding a white horse is not necessarily a prince, it could also be Tang Seng.\" After \"Qiao Longbiao\" became popular, this sentence should be changed. The one riding the white horse is not necessarily Tang Sanzang, it could also be Qiao Longbiao. \"If/Wen']\n"

It is reported that the Indian army and rescue personnel found more victims' bodies in some remote areas of Sikkim in the past 12 hours, and a total of 41 people have died in the earthquake in Sikkim so far. Since rescue workers have not yet entered the worst-hit areas around the epicenter, the final death toll is expected to rise. In addition, 17 people in the nearby states of West Bengal and Bihar also died of the earthquake. By the morning of the 20th, thousands of Indian soldiers were still working to clear the roads to remote areas of Sikkim, despite the danger of landslides at any moment. Due to the serious damage to the bridges and highways in the earthquake, the Indian army has been airlifting relief supplies and medicines to the disaster area by the “C-130” transport aircraft and airlifting rescue personnel and medical personnel by helicopter. The local government of Sikkim has established more than 100 temporary shelters to accommodate local residents whose houses were destroyed. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Indian army reopened the only national highway to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. Power supply has been restored in Gangtok, but electricity is still not available in most parts of Sikkim. Local government has asked residents and tourists to stay in Gangtok for the time being.

Yu Yangyi and Li Chao ranked 7th and 12th in the men's group respectively. ★ In the men's group, Vachier Lagrave overtook Yu Yangyi at the last moment in the seventh round, and the two decisive games that decided the men's champion came from the third seed, Belarusian Sergey Agarkalov and the eighth seed, Russian Ivan Popov, as well as the top seed, Frenchman Vachier Lagrave and the second seed, Russian Andreikin. After a fierce struggle for more than four hours, Sergey Dzagnidze, who was leading in the score, drew with Popov. Vachier Lagrave, who was half a point behind in the standings, won the game against Andreev with white pieces. Thus, Vassil-Lagrange equalized the score with Sergei Zhergalov at the last moment. After 13 rounds, the two teams had the same record of 8 wins and 5 draws, with 10.5 points each. Vasile-Lagrou won by a narrow margin and will also have a ticket to the next World Cup. Sergei Zhigalko came second, falling short of the gold. Vachier Lagrave is the second French chess player to win the World Junior Championship after the great French player Lotie. Polish chess player Olszewski and American chess player Linderman won the final round against Margovilashvili of Georgia and Iturraldega of Venezuela respectively, and both of them and Russian chess player Ivan Popov scored 9 points. After the comparison of the sub-points, Olszewski was fourth, Popov was fifth, and Lindemann was sixth. The 15-year-old Chinese player You Yangyi, who made his debut in the World Youth Chess Championship, played the first round of the last round against the Armenian player Grigoryan.

Another Chinese player Li Chao drew with the Italian player Vockaturo in the last round with the black pieces, finishing with 8 points from 13 rounds (6 wins, 4 draws, 3 losses). In addition to Li Chao, who also scored 8 points, there were seven players, including Iturriaga from Venezuela, Rodstein from Israel, and Howell from the UK, who were ranked 7, 5, and 4, respectively. After the comparison of the sub-points, Iturizaga and Rodenstein were placed 10th and 11th, respectively. Li Chao is 12th, and Howel is 13th. Throughout the entire match, Li Chao's performance score was 2607, basically in line with his rating. ★Suma's team had a slightly higher score, and Xuewen won the championship. The situation of the women's group was similar to that of the men's group, with two India-India matches being the key matches to determine the champion. In the end, Suma, the Indian chess player, took a light victory over Ozturk of Turkey in the opening move. Ilteriz, a Turkish chess player, drew calmly with the Indian chess player Giri. In addition, the 16-year-old Peruvian player Deis-Cori, the third board, won the last game with black pieces and easily defeated the fourth board player from Romania, Paulete. Thus, Suma and Deiz-Cori tied the lead with points at the last moment, ahead of Irdiz. All three had 8 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses, with 9.5 points.

The reporter Guojian. On December 23, 2009, Shanghai, the Chinese national team won 3-2 against Shanghai East Asia in a football friendly match. CFP provided the picture. In the afternoon, the national team, which was training in Shanghai, turned the match against Shanghai Daxia, a team from the Chinese League, around to win 3-2 in a friendly match. The head coach Gao Hongbo confirmed to the media before the match that the former national team player Jia Yi, who plays for the second-tier club of the German Bundesliga, will return to the national team to participate in the preparation this weekend. This means that the new national football team training camp finally has the shadow of overseas players. Shao Jia Yi returned to Beijing today. Regarding his re-selection to the national team, he told the reporter, \"It is an honor for every professional player to enter the national team, and I feel very excited to be able to enter the national team again.\" Since邵佳一 missed the penalty kick in the World Cup qualifier in March last year, he has never been included in the national team list. Now, he is selected by the coach Gao Hongbo, who has high standards, because of his excellent performance in the second tier of the German league. It is not important where I am placed. I am a new player and I need to work hard to adapt to the team\\'s tactics and techniques, speed up the integration with my teammates, and strive to get into the game as soon as possible. Jia-yi Shao showed great humility. The 2nd tier of the German league went into winter break last week. Apart from the 6 matches he missed due to injury, Jia Yi scored 6 goals in 11 league matches, which is enough to prove that Jia Yi, with his current form, has the qualifications to be a regular in the national team. In fact, the national team coaching staff\\'s desire for overseas players to return and play for the national team is not just for Shao Jia Yi. At least from the perspective of individual ability, Zheng Zhi, who plays for Kilmarnock in the Scottish Premier League, and Li Weifeng, who plays in the Korean league, can strengthen the national team. Even Zhou Haibin, who just finished his \"study\" in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, would be a great addition to the national team. Zheng Zhi was still struggling in the Celtic reserve team, while Li Weifeng was unable to be selected due to his emotional control problems in the match. Zhou Haibin is willing to face reality positively, and he has made great efforts, but he did not stay in Eindhoven. Roman, the Chinese agent of Zhou Haibin, said, \"He will return to China before Christmas, and his first choice for the next season is Shandong Luneng.\" Roman believes that even the reserve team matches are very helpful to Zhou Heping, but \"the competition is very fierce\", so Zhou Heping chose to develop at home. He did not consider staying out of Ajax a total failure, after all, he learned a lot in this season, which was very helpful for his football career. I think that Chinese players who go abroad have the ability to stand firm in the second-tier leagues in Europe, and Rong Hao is also like this. Roman said that Rong Hao\\'s going abroad in the new season is still not certain, because the transfer policy of the Chinese Football Association has not been officially issued, and Rong Hao\\'s club is Wuhan, which is a special situation. However, his ability can adapt to the second-tier leagues in Europe. In the highly competitive European football field, the best result for the top players in China is to settle in the second-tier leagues, which is also the most \"painful\" reality that many agents face when operating the overseas study of national team players. I feel that it is difficult for our players to play in the top league, and there are many reasons for this. Roman said, \"The biggest reason is that the national team has not performed well in international competitions in recent years, and the quality of the games is also not high, so foreign clubs are not very interested in Chinese players, and Chinese players have not been generally recognized by others.\" National team performance has always been a hard indicator for the international football market to evaluate players - among China, Japan, and South Korea, the plight of Chinese players studying abroad has always been \"linked\" to the national team\\'s ranking in Asia. When the former head coach Li Zhangshu left China, he said that Chinese players often overestimated themselves, \"many players even did not believe that there was such a big gap between China and Japan and South Korea,\" \"I hope that Chinese players can be trained in the league of Japan and South Korea.\" Now, many Korean players participate in the Japanese league, and there are also considerations at the national team level. However, the core players of the Japanese and South Korean national teams play in top-tier European leagues. Take the last two rounds of the top European leagues as an example, Lee Chinglong, the rising star from South Korea, scored for Bolton in the Premier League, while Park Chul-young scored for Monaco in the Ligue 1. Che Duri, who plays in the Bundesliga, played the full 90 minutes for Freiburg, and it was only natural that the team lost to Dortmund. On the contrary, the \"senior\" Park Ji-sung, who plays for Manchester United, has been somewhat quiet. The dazzling performance of the South Korean overseas brigade could not completely overshadow the Japanese overseas brigade, although the coach still did not trust the midfielders Jun辅中村, but Da辅松井, Shinji Kiyoshi of Guingamp in Ligue 1, Shinji Okazaki of Bochum in Bundesliga, and Kiyoshi Mori of Catania in Serie A were all starting players, and Catania\\'s victory over Juventus was also the biggest upset of this round of Serie A. In the national team training list released by Japan and South Korea in the same month, there are 6 players in Japan who are playing abroad, and the number of players in the South Korean team who are playing abroad is as high as 7. Compared with the national team that will participate in the first round of the Asian qualification for the World Cup in October next year, Japan and South Korea, which have directly entered the third round of the 20 strong teams, have obvious advantages. I don\\'t think the Chinese national team can qualify for the Brazil World Cup, and this has nothing to do with the coach, mainly because the players\\' strength does not meet the requirements. “A football agent told a reporter that in the past few years, Chinese players thought they could earn a lot of money in foreign leagues, so they were willing to go abroad to broaden their horizons. However, after going abroad, they found that their level was not good, and they were not adapted to the environment, and they had almost no chance to play. In the past two years, the players who wanted to go out have been more practical, but at present, none of the players are qualified to occupy a place in the top foreign leagues. This report from Beijing, December 23.']\n"

Currently, iPhone users can only access Skype through third-party services. Previously, Skype had launched a Skype application for Windows Mobile smart phones.

      "['涂力磊,王飞,赵勇', '正向', 'Real Estate: The planning of the Capital Economic Circle brings real estate opportunities. Huatong Securities Tu Lilei incident: Recently, Hebei Province invited officials, experts and scholars from the Beijing Urban Planning Commission and other departments to solicit opinions on the planning scheme of the \"Capital Economic Circle\". At the meeting, Wang Fei, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning, said that Beijing would not build a model district alone, but would solve the problems it faced through the coordinated development of the region as a whole. Zhao Yong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the vice governor in charge of the province, said that they would draw on the experience of the capital economic circles of Tokyo, Seoul and other cities, and formulate a general plan, a special plan, a detailed control plan, and so on. It is expected to be completed by the end of January next year. Comment: 1. The \"siphon\" effect brings urban problems. As the capital of China, Beijing has always enjoyed obvious advantages in attracting investment, policy support, and financial support. This inequality in treatment directly results in Beijing’s level of development far outstripping that of its neighbors, and even all other cities in the country. The direct result of this phenomenon is what is known as the \"siphon\" effect, in which talents, capital, and resources in the surrounding areas of the capital are concentrated in Beijing to a greater or lesser extent. The concentration of a large population and resources has led to a number of urban ills in Beijing after rapid development, such as population explosion, traffic congestion, resource shortage, soaring housing prices, limited development space, and increased pressure to improve the ecological environment. With the decreasing developable land in Beijing today, these urban ills are becoming more apparent. From the \"siphon\" effect to the \"spillover\" effect. The \"环首都经济圈\" was generated in this context. Its main purpose is to provide some support to the areas around Beijing in terms of policies and planning, so that the relevant regions can further承接 Beijing\\'s \"spillover effects\". After the rapid development of Beijing, the related industries, population, and capital will be covered to the surrounding areas. 3. Introduction to the Capital Economic Circle. The overall thinking of the construction of the \"ring capital economic circle\" is to build a development zone in the nearly 1000 kilometers around Beijing, mainly including Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Langfang, and Baoding, four prefecture-level cities surrounding Beijing. It includes the construction of high-level talent entrepreneurship park, science and technology achievement incubation park, new industry demonstration park, logistics park, and economic circle with new industry as the main body. This development zone will include three new towns, Jingdong, Jingnan, and Jingbei, and seven medium-sized cities with a population of more than 300,000, and will build a fully enclosed urban belt around the area of Beijing. 4. Investment advice. Currently, the gross domestic product created by the economic circles of many countries\\' capital cities accounts for more than one-third of the country. And the GDP of the three provinces and municipalities of Jing-Jin-Ji in 2009 was 3.66 trillion yuan, accounting for only 10.9% of the national total, and was still short of 7.518 trillion yuan to reach one-third of the country. Although, due to the large territory of our country, the concentration of cities cannot reach the level of Japan and South Korea. But, the承接of related industries and the migration of population will inevitably bring about economic development and a revaluation of land prices in the cities within the economic circle. Real estate companies with land reserves within economic circles will undoubtedly benefit directly. We believe that the \"Capital Economic Circle\" has greater practical significance than other regional revitalization concepts and can directly address the many problems currently faced by the capital. Thus, the concept is likely to continue heating up in the later stage. Concept-related beneficiary individual stocks include Rongsheng Development, Yicheng Shares, Wonton Real Estate, and Konggang Shares. 5. Risk warning. There is currently no exclusion of the possibility that the state will introduce further tightening policies, which will have a relatively negative impact on the operation of the real estate industry.']\n"

      "['陆天明,陆川,韩寒,秦岚,方海征,吕后', '正向', 'Lu Tianming Interview: I am obsessed with Weibo and will not urge Lu Chuan to get married. From August 21 to 24, our newspaper held a \"Assembly of Heroes\" literary salon, and the famous writer Lu Tianming was invited to attend. Lu Tianming responded in the interview to the intense dialogue with Han Han, as well as to becoming a topic figure after the high-speed train accident. During the interview, the reporter also mentioned the romance between the director Lu Chuan (Weibo) and the actress Qin Lan (Weibo). As the father of Lu Chuan, Lu Tianming admitted that he was very eager to be a grandfather. Being addicted to Weibo, if there are any problems, ask the netizen Lu Tianming. On the day he arrived in Dalian, the journalist interviewed him for a special interview at the hotel where he checked in. On the writing desk in the hotel room, the computer of Lu Tianming showed the Weibo webpage. Are you a Weibo addict? Hearing the reporter ask like that, Lu Tianming chuckled and said, \"I should be.\" But, I have it under control. I didn\\'t change my phone to stop myself from being so obsessed with Weibo. I have many friends who immediately open their phones to check Weibo as soon as the plane lands, even during meals, while I have already controlled myself. When Lu Tianming first started playing Weibo, he did not know how to use many functions. \"When I didn\\'t know how to do something, I asked netizens, and many people taught me. Now I can add followers, send private messages, and post long Weibos, all of which were taught to me by netizens.\" Because of the blog, in 2009, Lu Tianming and Han Han had a heated debate on the blog, during which time Lu Tianming was a topic of discussion. In the interview, he brought up the argument he had had with the reporter that year. I had a quarrel with Han Han on my blog, and there was a lot of online abuse. At that time, the people on the website advised me to close the blog, but I didn\\'t. Without that quarrel back then, I really wouldn\\'t have known that there were such young people on the Internet, with such thoughts and values. Years later, Lu Tianming said that when he first saw those intense comments on the Internet, he was so angry that he was trembling all over. \"Later, I understood that everyone has their own true self, and wears different masks in different situations. On the Internet, everyone can hide behind the computer and completely expose themselves.\" Now, Lu Tianming can face all kinds of comments on the Internet with a calm mind, because different people have different views on things. After being involved in public opinion, Lu Tianming could face verbal attacks with a calm mind. After opening a blog, he became a topic figure on the Internet because of the argument with Han Han. After opening his microblog, Lu Tianming became a topic again due to a microblog post about the accident of the EMU in the recent period. Lu Tianming was very angry and helpless about becoming a topic. \"My Weibo was uploaded before the high-speed train accident. I think some people deliberately forwarded my Weibo. Moreover, after the high-speed train accident, those people seemed to not read my Weibo, and confused the public opinion, using my previous Weibo to talk about it.\" Later, a friend advised Lu Tianming to delete that Weibo post, but he firmly refused, \"I have no regrets, and I will never delete it.\" In the interview, Lu Tianming said that because of his creation, he had interviewed the engineers who studied high-speed rail. \"As the technology independently developed by our country, I know how hard those engineers have worked.\" After the incident, I happened to be in Shanghai, and I was originally going to take a plane back to Beijing. I refunded the plane ticket and specially bought a high-speed rail ticket. This is not a show, because I really think that this technology is the pride of our nation. Unlike the last time when all kinds of people on the Internet said hurtful things, Lu Tianming was much more at ease this time when facing online attacks. \"I understand that there are all kinds of people on Weibo, so I should treat them rationally. Therefore, no matter what extreme words everyone writes, I can accept them.\" Literary creation should put down its airs and get closer to the masses. Lu Tianming once worked as a farmer and a primary school teacher in Anhui countryside, and as a farm worker and deputy guide of the armed company in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. He is now a full-time screenwriter of the Literature Department of the TV Drama Production Center of China Central Television. \"Great Snow Without Traces\", \"Provincial Party Secretary\", and \"Fate\" are his representative works. When it comes to literature, Lu Tianming said that the environment for pure literature is not as good as it was in the past, \"but many writers\\' pursuit of pure literature was a bit too much in the past.\" Many people who pursue pure literature do not attach much importance to the reaction of readers, but only show themselves, and some even take pride in it. Lu Tianming said that he had done this before, for example, when he wrote the novel \"Mud Day\" and more than twenty judges said after reading it that they did not know what he was talking about. At the time, it was written so that people couldn\\'t understand it without telling them the theme. But as society developed, Lu Tianming believed that pure literature was no longer viable. \"I took ten years to transform myself, and the reason I was able to write such good stories was that I went through a very painful period of transformation.\" Literature should not be aloof, but should be more down-to-earth, and must make readers like reading, cry and laugh with the story. Pure literature cannot look down on the masses as it did in the past, but should put down its pride and make both the old comrades and the masses satisfied. The son\\'s marriage is a way to urge Lu Chuan to get married. Lu Tianming became famous early in his career, and at that time, he often heard people say, \"This is Lu Chuan, Lu Tianming\\'s son.\" Now, as Lu Chuan\\'s fame grows, many people say, \"This is Lu Tianming, Lu Chuan\\'s father.\" Lu Tianming was actually very happy about such a transformation. Who doesn\\'t want their children to have a bright future? I am so happy that my son has such a great future that I laugh in my sleep. The father is a screenwriter and the son is a director. The two of them have many possibilities to collaborate on a work. Lu Tianming said that they also had this intention, \"Someone asked me and Lu Chuan whether we could make a movie together a long time ago. We have this intention, but at least now it has not taken shape.\" This work must be satisfactory to both of us. We need to find the best point of convergence between the two generations, and one plus one must be greater than two. Otherwise, it is easy for people to think that we are trying to make a quick buck. There are more celebrities getting married this year. In an interview, the reporter asked Lu Chuan and girlfriend Qin Lan whether they were also about to have a good thing. Lu Tianming, like the parents of all bachelors and spinsters, is anxious about his son’s lifelong matters, but he smiles and says he will not urge him to get married. I will not urge him to get married, but I will ask him in a roundabout way when I can hold a grandson or granddaughter, and use this method to urge him. \"Reporter Fang Hanzheng event replay Lu Chuan Qin Lan because shooting \\'Nanjing\\' in love in September 2009, insiders in the industry revealed that \"Nanjing!\" Nanjing! Director Lu Chuan and actress Qin Lan, who starred in the film, have fallen in love. In October 2008, netizens reported that they saw the two people dating and kissing, which shows that this romance has lasted for a long time. Lu Chuan, who was then preparing to transfer in France to attend the San Sebastian International Film Festival, was contacted by the journalist and responded generously and admitted to the relationship. It is reported that Qin Lan not only starred in \"Nanjing!\" for free. Nanjing! She also paid another production team hundreds of thousands of yuan in compensation due to scheduling issues, and she put a lot of effort into filming. Her excellent performance moved the film director Lu Chuan, and \"friendship\" gradually evolved into \"love\". Though they have been in love for a long time, the two of them have always been very low-key. According to the Chongqing Evening News, Qin Lan played \"Lü Hou\" and was criticized for being old and fat, which was in compliance with Lu Chuan\\'s order. Qin Lan played \"Lü Hou\" in Lu Chuan\\'s new film \"The Banquet of the King\", and she was criticized for her loose skin, exaggerated weight gain, and pregnancy-like appearance. The day before yesterday, Qin Lan accepted an interview with a journalist and responded generously to the controversy. She admitted that all of this was for Lu Chuan, and she \"obeyed orders\" to gain weight and age. Reporter: Everyone says you have gained weight. Qin Lan: In order to play the role of Empress Lu, the director hopes that I will gain weight. My previous weight was about 95 to 96 pounds, and now it should be around 108 pounds. Reporter: Lu Chuan always thinks you are too thin? Qin Lan: Previously, Lu Chuan thought that my image was relatively delicate. When Empress Lu appeared in the film, she was already quite old. If she was too thin, the aura of this character would be insufficient. He hopes that I can be a little fatter, because fat can show maturity, and then do some old-fashioned styling on this basis, which will produce a better effect. The reporter asked, \"Do you complain about the director making such a big sacrifice for you?\" Qin Lan: I am so uncomfortable. The clothes I used to wear can no longer fit me. I will go on a forced diet as soon as I finish shooting this drama. The reporter asked: Does Director Lu Chuan put a lot of pressure on your performance? Qin Lan: After so many years of acting, \"Empress Lu\" is the most difficult role for me to complete. For a while, I was under a lot of stress and was extremely nervous. Although I really wanted to eat, I often couldn\\'t, but I still had to eat to gain weight. The reporter asked, \"Have many people asked you if you are pregnant because you have gained weight?\"  Qin Lan: Because they don\\'t know why I gained weight. They said I was too fat, I should be pregnant, actually I was quite happy, because I was always worried that I couldn\\'t get fat in such a short time, never thinking that I could do it.

Sina Sports News, on September 3rd, according to the US media Project Spurs, Bruce Bowen will hold a press conference to announce his retirement on the ESPN 1250 program. After the end of last season, the Spurs traded Bowen to the Bucks in exchange for Richard Jefferson. Bowen was then cut by the Bucks. But he turned down a contract offer from the Celtics, and wanted to return to San Antonio. But there was no place for him on the Spurs either. With Jefferson and Michael-Finley on board, Bowen would have almost no chance to play, and the Spurs’ salary cap concerns had also made them reluctant to include Bowen in their plans. So Bowen finally chose to retire. Of course, Bowen could come out of retirement if the Spurs need a tough defender during the playoffs and get injured. The press conference will be held at 2 p.m. tomorrow. Bowen was not selected in the draft and played overseas until he joined the Heat in 1996. But the Heat cut him a year later. After that, Bowen played for the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, and San Antonio Spurs. Bowen is one of the best perimeter defenders in the current league and also one of the dirtiest defenders in the current league. He relies on total concentration on defense, tough body-to-body interference, and immense pressure on the ball handler. Bowen was often criticized for using dirty tactics that could hurt opponents during defense, and players such as Ray Allen and coaches such as Isiah Thomas criticized Bowen's defensive style. In the Spurs, Bowen reached the peak of his career. He was selected to the All-Defensive Second Team for three consecutive years from 2001 to 2003, and then to the All-Defensive First Team for three consecutive years from 2004 to 2007. Won three championships with the Spurs in 2003, 2005 and 2007. Most importantly, Bowen only missed 26 games in eight years with the Spurs, and only took three days off in the last seven years, making him a true iron man. (Warm)\"]\n"

      "['', '正向', \"DBS: Breakthrough with increased volume to see a little higher DBS\\uf0d8Although the market rally after the holiday was expected by the market, the strong performance of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets last week still gave the market a big surprise. With the support of multiple factors such as a rebound in some economic data (PMI, VAI, and M2 growth rate, etc.), policy support (industrial revitalization plan, central agricultural support No. 1 document, introduction of the Growth Enterprise Market, and rumors of resumption of IPO, etc.), bottom rebound of overseas markets, and easing of market liquidity, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets experienced a volume surge and a strong rise last week. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 193.6 points, up 9.57%, while Shenzhen Index rose by 756.7 points, up 10.79%. Trading volumes in both cities saw a significant increase, up 53.3% and 60% respectively compared to the trading week before the holiday. The market, which faced a significant resistance level of 2,100 points at the beginning, completed the adjustment in just half a trading day, showing a breakout with increased volume, revealing the market's short-term strength. With no negative macroeconomic data in the short term, the market is in a short-term vacuum of negative data, and the policy and capital faces will continue to push the market higher in a relatively宽松的环境. We judge that the market will experience a pullback after encountering the upper track of the upward channel 2250 in this week, and the market focus will still be on the catch-up of policy-benefited stocks and blue-chip stocks in the first and second lines. Hold long positions for the short term, but reduce positions actively near the important resistance level of 2250 to prevent a sharp short-term retracement. It is worth emphasizing that the current market is still a rebound in a bear market: it is difficult for the fundamentals of the economy to improve in the short term, which is the main factor constraining the market's long-term rise. Although policy support has significantly improved market expectations, it is difficult to fundamentally reverse the downward trend of the economy in the short term. Therefore, we take a cautiously optimistic view of the future market performance. We believe that it is difficult for the resistance level around 2250 to be effectively broken in the short term, and investors should be prepared to take profits at any time. After the SASAC launched the revitalization plan for 10 industries, the adjustment and revitalization plans for the automobile, steel and textile and equipment manufacturing industries have been successively unveiled, and the revitalization plan for the electronics and information industry has also been submitted to the National Development and Reform Commission for discussion and has been initially recognized, and is about to become the third batch of industries to be approved. The central government's No.1 document issued at the beginning of the new year once again included agriculture as a positively supported industry, in addition to the promotion of rural markets for home appliances and mobile phones, the promotion of rural markets for cars and agricultural machinery is also underway, and investors have high expectations for the launch of the rural market. In addition, the central bank is gradually implementing a prudent and accommodative monetary policy to increase financial support for the economy. Not only is there a possibility of continued interest rate cuts in the future, but the growth rate of M2, a measure of money supply, has also rebounded significantly: the growth rate in December increased by 3 percentage points to 17.8% from 14.8% in November. The rebound of M2 as a leading indicator of the market and the abundance of market liquidity have provided good external conditions for the market to perform well. Despite the continued deterioration of the fundamentals of the overseas market, the market has received good support at the bottom in the early period, and the short-term stabilization has formed a good external atmosphere for A-shares. So, taking into account the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals, policies, and peripheral market factors, we believe that the market will continue to rise in the short term and may challenge the 2250 point level this week. Given the increased probability of a sharp rise followed by a fall, it is recommended that investors maintain necessary caution and appropriately reduce their positions at the top to avoid the risk of a correction. From a purely technical perspective, the market has shown a breakout with increased volume when facing important technical resistance levels, indicating that the future market trend will continue to develop in depth. From the perspective of the moving average pattern, all the moving average indicators are in a bullish arrangement, and both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indices have firmly stood above the 120-day semi-annual line, and the medium-term technical indicators of the market tend to strengthen. From the wave pattern, the lower track of the current upward channel has climbed to around 2020 points, which will become an important support level for the market after a short-term rebound and decline. And the upper track of the upward channel has reached the 2250 point line. Due to this area being the region of huge volume of trapped shares in the early stage, the market will encounter a large selling pressure at this point, and the probability of short-term rebound and then falling back is increasing. RSI and KDJ in the short and medium term have climbed to a high again, but have not yet reached new highs with the index, indicating a certain decline in the market's buying power, and the technical pressure for a pullback is increasing. Based on the comprehensive technical analysis, we believe that there is a chance to break through the 2250 point level this week, but considering the factors of the economic fundamentals, we still adhere to the operation strategy of reducing positions and taking profits at high levels, and guard against the risk of a rebound after a sharp rise in the short term.\"]\n"

Reporter Peng Lei reported that at 6:50 p.m. on Monday, with only 10 minutes left before the winter transfer window closed, Inter Milan\\'s technical manager Branca finally registered Parma player Mariaga\\'s contract with the Professional League. The 23-year-old Kenyan midfielder became Inter Milan\\'s last acquisition of the winter. This is a lucky find. In fact, Mariga\\'s contract on Monday was supposed to be registered with Manchester City, while Inter Milan intended to register Ledesma\\'s or Simplicio\\'s contract from Lazio or Palermo, but a lot happened in a day. For several days, Lazio has been negotiating with Inter over the sale of Ledesma. On Monday morning, Lotti insisted on 10 million euros or 8 million euros plus some young players on loan, ownership, etc., but Inter Milan only wanted to settle for 8 million euros in cash. Actually, the gap was not that big, but Inter did not wait for Lotti\\'s call, so they began to focus on Brazilian midfielder Simplicio of Palermo, and Branca also began to negotiate with Zamparini, in the form of a loan. But Palermo wants to borrow two young players from Inter, Kerchin, who is in the first team, and Fossati, who is in the youth team. Simpriolio had already flown to Milan around noon on Monday, and it seemed that the signing was imminent. Inter Milan is now asking the opinion of two young men, but neither of them wants to leave. So Simplicio\\'s path to Inter was closed, and Inter set their sights on Mariya in the absence of any response from Olittto. Mariga, who was almost certain to join Man City under Mancini, received the news on Monday morning that he could not get a work permit. Mariga’s 90th place in the FIFA ranking and some bureaucratic procedures in the Premier League made it impossible for Mariga to join Man City. In fact, two years ago, Portsmouth was also introduced to a Kenyan by Palermo for 1.5 million euros because it did not acquire a Kenyan in accordance with the relevant regulations. So, Parma and Inter Milan came to an agreement: 2.5 million euros in cash plus half the ownership of Biabiany (who was on loan to Parma last summer) in exchange for half the ownership of Mariaga. Simplicio, with a hint of regret, stayed in Palermo to continue his career, while Ledesma, Inter\\'s first choice, was furious, and his agent Dipolito complained bitterly after the transfer failed, \"It\\'s all over now, it\\'s too late.\" Lottin contacted Inter Milan only at 16:00, but unfortunately, they already had a new target. I had been reminding Lotti for a long time that there was no time left, but he refused to call President Moratti out of his so-called pride and self-respect. Actually, from the moment Inter Milan made their final offer on Saturday afternoon, Lotti was basically in agreement, he just wanted to wait until the last moment. Now he finds himself in the wrong, having lost 10 million euros. Now he is trying to sell the player to Manchester City or Genoa, but Christian (Ledesma) wants to go to Inter Milan, so he refused. Continue to play for Lazio? Let\\'s see, now Christian is in a very bad mood, he is very disappointed. Inter was not overly disappointed, said owner Massimo Moratti, \"Mariaga was a surprise?\" Sure, he\\'s a young player, an interesting player, the hope of the future, and I\\'m very satisfied. Did you not get Ledesma? It is not a bad thing if the world can save some money. I just feel sorry for the players, but it is not the end of the world. But there were also negative voices, with someone painting “Black is enough!” on the fence outside a villa belonging to Moraţiu in Lea County. The racial slogan, in addition to Balotelli, also refers to the African midfielder just acquired. Mariga has been included in the Coppa Italia squad for the match against Fiorentina, and Mourinho said, \"I saw Mariga, he just recovered from an injury, but his training was very good, so I included him in the squad.\" Am I satisfied with this acquisition? Yes, I need a midfielder, and Marija is not a finished player, he is still young and growing, and I like such players. \"']\n"

After the junior high school entrance examination, he often locked himself in the room and pondered over this mysterious game for several hours continuously. The son\\'s persistent magic dream touched his parents, who found a professional magician to teach him professional magic skills.

In 2008, Shao Mingxuan began to perform at fairs with his master during his spare time. I took the money home and gave it to my parents so they would know that I could continue on the path of magic.

The Nokia Surge is designed in such a way that the keyboard and screen are not aligned when the phone is closed, and with its heavy body, I personally don't think the appearance is very attractive. The Nokia Surge is equipped with a 2.4-inch QVGA (240×320 pixels) resolution 16 million color TFT screen, an integrated 2-megapixel camera, 4x digital zoom, and supports four-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE as well as dual-band UMTS and HSDPA 3.6 Mbps network data transmission.

      "['舒时,黄硕辉', '正向', 'Swiss Re: Hong Kong and Mainland China have different attitudes towards the insurance industry Shushih Swiss Re disclosed the \"Swiss Re 2009 Asia Pacific Risk Orientation Survey\" yesterday (June 15), the results of which show that Hong Kong and Mainland China have different attitudes towards insurance. Hong Kong people are more inclined to take risks, while mainland consumers are more conservative. This report by Swiss Re is for adults aged between 20 and 40 in the Asia-Pacific region. The results of its risk orientation show that most Hong Kong SMEs are still willing to actively borrow to seek business growth even in a global economic downturn. And Hong Kong consumers are the least willing to use professional financial planning services in the Asia-Pacific region; however, many Hong Kong respondents said they would review their policies in light of the threat of the H1N1 flu. To facilitate the comparison of data across different markets and track long-term changes, the survey results are consolidated into two indices, the Swiss Re Asia Pacific Consumer Attitudes to Risk Index (CAFRI) and the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Attitudes to Risk Index (BAFRI). The higher the two indices are, the more risk averse they are. Hong Kong people do not like to use financial planning from the perspective of consumer risk attitude, and Hong Kong consumers\\' risk orientation ranks second in the Asia-Pacific region. The survey found that Hong Kong people aged 20 to 40 had the highest CAFRI value of 47.8 among the eight APL markets surveyed, second only to Australians. The head of Swiss Re\\'s Economic Research and Consulting team in Asia-Pacific, Wong Shuk Fai, believes that the high ranking of Hong Kong people is due to their higher risk appetite for employment and health, ranking second in the Asia-Pacific region. When it comes to finance and lifestyle, Hong Kong people are more resistant to risk and are in the middle of the pack in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the survey results confirmed that Hong Kong men aged 20 to 30 were more willing to take risks. According to the report, the respondents from the mainland were more conservative, with a CAFRI value of 43.4 and ranked sixth. This part shows that the mainland is still at a disadvantage in employment and health, leading to more conservative consumer behavior in these areas. From a financial planning perspective, although 76% of Hong Kong respondents are very concerned about how to secure their future financial situation, only 54% of them have specific plans in place. Hong Kong consumers are the least willing to use professional financial planning services in the Asia-Pacific region, with only 17% of respondents believing it is necessary to use such services. Wong said that the insurance industry needs to make more efforts to raise public awareness of the importance of early financial planning and to help them understand that qualified financial planners can help them make better financial plans. Professional financial advisors also need to maintain and improve their professional standards to enhance public confidence in them. Financial products should be sold based on customers\\' needs. In fact, the Lehman mini-bonds and the recent exposure of the Morgan Stanley Clever Bonds incident both indicate that Hong Kong people are too confident in their investment decisions. In contrast, more than 20% of consumers on the mainland recognize the role of professional financial planning. It is perhaps most noteworthy that the mainland enterprises are more willing to take risks, and the survey also shows that the mainland enterprises without access to financing are more willing to take financing risks. In the business surveys of eight markets, Hong Kong SMEs have a relatively low orientation to business risks, with a BAFRI value of only 32.1, ranking sixth among the eight markets in the Asia-Pacific region, only higher than Malaysia and India. And the BAFRI value of the respondents from the mainland was 35.4, indicating that they were more willing to take business risks, ranking second in the risk orientation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Shuhui said that more than half of the respondents from the mainland SMEs regarded the current financial crisis as an opportunity for business development, and were more optimistic than those from Hong Kong and India. In contrast, 68% of Hong Kong respondents prefer organic growth over acquisitions to achieve business expansion, while 70% of them are unwilling to expand into new products or businesses. However, a large number of SME respondents in Hong Kong (71%) and Mainland China (74%) said that they would be willing to borrow more if it would help their business to grow quickly. Wong Shuk Fai believes that, even under the current severe financial crisis, in the face of the increase in business development variables, small and medium-sized enterprises, as the driving force of Hong Kong\\'s economic growth, have not completely given up the opportunity or willingness to develop their business, which to some extent reflects the support of government policies, and the ability to obtain credit will encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to increase their financial leverage levels. Although Huang Shuhui did not explain why mainland Chinese entrepreneurs are so risk-tolerant, it is certain that these entrepreneurs have not received sufficient credit support, as have Hong Kong’s small and medium-sized enterprises. Their aspirations may reflect the financing difficulties of mainland Chinese entrepreneurs.']\n"

Mobile phones, as a daily communication tool, have gradually integrated into people's lives, and people hope to own a phone that suits themselves. When it comes to buying a mobile phone, some people are after the practical, while others are after the luxury. For example, the current HTC sensation, Samsung GALAXY SII, and other high-end mobile phones are all above 4,000-5,000 yuan, and such models are more suitable for people who have sufficient funds and pursue high-end enjoyment. However, for those who want to experience high-end but have a tight budget, waiting for these models to be discounted is indeed a long process. Fortunately, there are still some models that have been pushed down from the flagship throne in the market, although they have become mid-to-high-end phones, their performance is no less than that, and the price is also relatively reasonable. Like the LGP990, which has a dual-core processor, but is priced similarly to the HTC Desire S (参数报价图片论坛软件) with a single-core processor. So today, I will bring you a few phones with a good price-performance ratio, hoping to provide some help for friends who are buying a phone recently.

      "['', '正向', 'The 2011 National Adult Higher Education School Admissions Examination will be held from October 15 to 16. The number of candidates in Hainan Province will be 25,000. On the 13th, the provincial education department learned that some of the examination sites in Haikou would change. Examinees can collect their admission cards at the registration point three days before the exam. Examinees should arrive early to take the security check. This year\\'s national adult college entrance examination has three levels, that is, high school start to vocational education, high school start to undergraduate and vocational education start to undergraduate. Among them, the subjects of the upgrading from vocational school to university are divided into 8 categories, namely Chinese and traditional Chinese medicine, art, science and engineering, economics and management, law, education, and medicine. The unified examination subjects for upgrading from vocational school to university are politics, English, and professional basic courses. The subjects for the college entrance examination for high school graduates applying for undergraduate programs are four subjects, namely Chinese, mathematics (literary or scientific), foreign language, and history and geography or physics and chemistry; the subjects for the college entrance examination for high school graduates applying for junior college programs are four subjects, namely Chinese, mathematics (literary or scientific), foreign language, and civic morality and legal foundation. The Provincial Department of Education has required all the examination centers in each county and city to strictly enforce the examination discipline. Examinations and examination rooms are under closed management. During the examination period, no irrelevant personnel are allowed to enter the examination site and the examination room. Examiners must strictly check and compare the identity card, admission ticket, and the photo of the examinee with the photo on the seat list when the examinees enter the examination room, to prevent the occurrence of proxy examination. To prevent and block cheating behaviors such as \"carrying\" and \"using wireless communication devices\" during the examination period, all cities and counties will take security checks for candidates entering the examination hall this year, and the invigilators will use \"hand-held metal detectors\" to conduct a full-body check on the candidates. The Provincial Department of Education requires that each city and county must train and drill candidates for security checks at the entrance. During the examination period, each examination site must set up inspection posts at the entrance of the teaching building and at the entrance of the examination room, and strictly follow the operating procedures to conduct body searches on candidates to prevent candidates from bringing prohibited items into the examination room. Careful work should be done to rotate the invigilators for the examination sessions. Rotating assignments are randomly arranged by provincial inspection officers and announced 60 minutes before the exam starts. Proctors shall not refuse to carry out the assignments for any reason. The \"School Safety Project\" has brought about new changes in the location of individual examination sites. There are a total of 8 examination sites and 380 examination rooms in Haikou examination area. The examination center of Haikou City reminds candidates that due to some schools implementing the school safety project, the location of some examination sites has changed compared to previous years.

      "['岳建国,陈大琪', '正向', 'College Entrance Examination Comment: A Large Number of Candidates \"Diving\" Is a Good Phenomenon Today\\'s Keyword: A Sharp Reduction in Candidates This Phenomenon Is a Good Thing, It Relieves the Phenomenon of \"Ten Thousand Soldiers Competing for a Single Bridge\" and Sends a Clear Message to All National Universities: In the Future, the Good Days of Enjoying the Advantage of Monopoly of Students Are Getting Less and Less Reliable. □The reporter of the newspaper, Yue Jianguo, this year, the total number of people registered for the college entrance examination in Henan Province is 855,000, which is nearly 100,000 less than last year\\'s 952,000, which is the largest \"dive\" in history. Regarding this, Chen Dazhi, a spokesperson for the provincial admissions office, said that this was because this year was the first year of the new curriculum reform, and the number of college students was less than in previous years. Secondly, it was due to the natural increase and decrease in population and the分流of vocational education, which means that it will be easier for Henan students to go to college. According to insiders, some universities will face severe survival challenges due to the gradual depletion of their student sources. The number of candidates for the college entrance examination has experienced the largest drop in history, and the reasons are not limited to the above. If we look back at the destinations of high school students around us, we will find that we should add \"an increasing number of high school students are directly employed and studying abroad\" to the above factors, although we do not have authoritative statistical data to support it. Overall, this phenomenon is a good thing, not only making it easier for candidates to go to university, but also significantly alleviating the phenomenon that once shocked, worried, and frustrated us, \"ten thousand soldiers competing for a single bridge\", and at the same time sending a clear message to universities across the country: in the future, universities must rely more and more on teaching quality, employment rate and talent cultivation rate to survive, and the good days of relying on the monopoly of source and playing it easy are becoming less and less reliable. Since the high enrollment trend in 1999, colleges and universities have blindly expanded enrollment, while the population birth has naturally increased and decreased, leading to a significant increase in the admission ratio, with admission rates as high as 80% in many provinces. Corresponding to this \"massive enrollment drive\" was a large number of college graduates from rural areas who were unemployed after graduation, who did not want to let down the expectations of their hometown elders for them to \"escape the countryside\", and who could not find satisfactory jobs due to their lack of skills and good parents, thus becoming a huge \"ant tribe\" living in the urban-rural fringe areas of large and medium-sized cities. This phenomenon has had a great effect – leading to an increasing number of high school students choosing an alternative path. For example, high school students from better-off families go abroad for further education; some high school students, especially those from rural areas, go to the city to work with their relatives and friends, relying on their own efforts; some enter vocational schools and will become decent technical workers in the future. Thus, the phenomenon of a sharp decline in the number of people registering for the national college entrance examination, even a “plunge,” appeared. But this is not a bad thing, as an open environment and market economy have provided candidates with more choices. Think about it, ordinary families save up their money to send their children to study abroad, so that the successors of the motherland can have a broader perspective and stronger abilities. Isn\\'t this the best thing? In the past, we always said that developed countries attach great importance to vocational education, and the college admission rate in the United States is only about 70%. Are we not also going down this road? Currently, almost all private enterprises across the country are facing the problem of difficulty in recruitment. Is it a solution to the immediate problem for high school graduates to find jobs? But this phenomenon is bound to unsettle, if not put pressure on, many universities. For many years, some of them have built new campuses and expanded old ones to increase majors and classes. But they did not expect that, just as their enrollment scale had expanded, the number of students suddenly decreased. Looking at the vast and empty campus, could they not be anxious? But from the perspective of improving the quality of higher education, it is a good thing, as it makes them feel that whether they go abroad or work in private enterprises, they are all dissatisfied with the quality of their teaching, and are abandoning them, forcing them to wake up and reform, to catch up with first-class universities, to promote effective competition among universities, and ultimately lead to a general improvement in the quality of teaching in Chinese universities.']\n"

      "['余子君', '正向', \"The QDII team has grown and is expected to reach 40 by the end of the first half of the year. The Securities Times reporter Yu Zijun. This year, the issuance of Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDII) has accelerated. As of yesterday, 10 QDII have already been established. Including QDII that are currently being issued and will be issued, QDII is expected to reach 40 by the end of the first half of the year. According to Tianxiang Investment Advisor, as of yesterday, there are 37 QDII funds established this year, and the Huataan Greater China Upgrade Fund also started fundraising on April 18. Calculating with a one-month fundraising period, the fund will end fundraising in the near future. In addition, the recently approved GSF Standard & Poor's Global Agriculture Index Fund will also be issued in the near future. And Fuguo Fund submitted a global top consumer stock fund on November 15 last year. Calculating the 6-month approval process, if the fund is issued immediately after approval, the number of QDII funds in the first half of the year will reach 40. In fact, according to the progress disclosure table of the CSRC's approved fund fundraising applications, apart from the GFF S&P Global Agriculture Index Fund and the Fidelity Global Top Consumer Goods Fund, there are still 7 QDII that have submitted application materials and are waiting for approval. After the resumption of QDII approval at the end of 2009, fund companies were enthusiastic about issuing, and the issuance this year is even more enthusiastic. As of yesterday, 10 QDII products have been established this year, one is being issued, one is about to be issued, and 8 QDII have submitted fundraising applications and are waiting for approval. And a total of 18 QDII were established last year, with 7 established in the first half and 11 in the second half. From the perspective of the fund company, there are currently 27 fund companies that have QDII products, accounting for nearly half. Among them, large fund companies such as BT, Nanshan, Yi Fangda and Jashi already have 2 QDII products. If you count the fund companies that are about to issue and have already submitted QDII fundraising applications, then Jash and Nandong will welcome their third QDII products, and Nono, Guofa, Huatiefu, Fuguo, and Guotai will also have two QDII products. Jingzhen Changcheng and Guhafulanqin fund companies will also welcome their first QDII products. In terms of product features, compared with the first batch of QDII that went overseas, in the past two years, fund companies have paid more attention to product innovation. Such as Nu'an Gold and Yi Fangda Gold Fund, which focus on gold investment, Fidelity Global Bond Fund, which focuses on the global bond market, GTAM Nasdaq 100 Index Fund, which focuses on index investment, Jashen Hang Seng H-share, Dacheng S&P 500, Changxin S&P 100, and Guangfa S&P Global Agriculture Index Fund, etc. In addition, Nuon An Fund also reported the first domestic oil and gas energy fund in China this year. Industry insiders pointed out that QDII approval was once suspended in the second half of 2008, and after the approval was released at the end of 2009, fund companies issued QDII products with great enthusiasm to improve their product lines. Currently, large fund companies basically have 2 QDII products, and some large fund companies that only have 1 QDII product are also accelerating the preparation of the second product. An insider of a fund company in Shanghai said that although QDII issuance was booming, due to the high operation cost of QDII business, many fund companies were operating at a loss at present. For small and medium-sized fund companies, if not to improve the product line, the motivation to launch was not strong.

      "['赵玉涛,奥巴马', '正向', 'New Dazhou: A Neglected New Energy Battery Concept. Zhaoyutao, a securities researcher from Zhongzeng Securities, after the first-tier varieties of new energy batteries, such as杉杉股份, Tibet Mining, and Keliyuan, have been continuously soaring and becoming rich, today, the second and third-tier varieties in the new energy battery sector, such as Zhongjinrui Technology and Foshu Share, have been strongly closed, and have once again fully activated the market enthusiasm! Stimulated by this, related varieties of the new energy battery industry chain, such as China CITIC Security, China Baoan, and Fufeng Automobile, also closed with long阳. Looking back at the recent trading, varieties such as Tibet Mining,杉杉股份, CITIC National Security, and China Baowu in the new energy battery sector have all played out the miracle of new energy battery benefits. One can say that for a while, new energy batteries were in full swing, with black horses galloping! There is no pair, the expectation of Obama\\'s victory before this, has made the stock price of the US energy giant First Solar Inc. (FSLR) rise sharply. Clearly, a new wave of enthusiasm for new energy batteries is sweeping the global stock market, and the driving force behind it is the US new president Obama\\'s 150 billion US dollar new energy plan for the next ten years. Thus, it can be said that the market prospects of new energy batteries are beyond imagination, and related listed companies are bound to face significant investment opportunities. In addition, the new energy battery sector has experienced a round of frenzied growth, and the overall valuation has been significantly increased, bringing great investment opportunities to new energy battery-related varieties, especially some second and third-tier varieties that have not been discovered by the market, such as Jinrui Technology and Foshan Plastic Corporation, which have been strongly closed today, are typical examples! Therefore, we believe that the new Dazhou (000571) of the same variety, which has not performed well, is worthy of investors\\' close attention! Records show that Dalian Xinyuan Power, in which Xinda (000571) has a stake, is the largest enterprise in the field of fuel cells in China. It was the first to convert the laboratory research results of fuel cells into real productive forces in China. The Passat Lingyu hydrogen fuel cell sedan provided by Xinyuan Power and other units has been put into demonstration operation as a public service vehicle in the Olympic Center area. At the same time, Shanghai Xinda Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Xinda (000571), specializes in the research, manufacturing and sales of electric bicycles. Given that the first-tier varieties in the new energy battery sector have surged significantly, and the second and third-tier varieties have shown strong performance, the new and authentic theme of new energy power in Xin Da Zou (000571) has been seriously overlooked by the market. It is believed that this stock will replicate the神话of consecutive涨停of similar varieties! Obama\\'s efforts in new energy will break through in fuel cells.In fact, since he began his campaign, Obama has shown great concern for the new energy industry. There is a great tilt in industrial policy towards new energy, and 150 billion US dollars will be invested in the next ten years to support the research of alternative energy, and tax incentives will be provided for related companies; develop clean energy, and reduce dependence on oil from the Middle East and Venezuela; it is planned that 10% of the power generation in the United States in 2012 will come from renewable energy. Among them, Obama\\'s preference for new energy vehicles is particularly eye-catching, and it is currently rumored that a hybrid Cadillac will be used as the official car of the White House. Obama promised during his campaign to encourage consumers to buy energy-efficient cars with a tax credit of $7,000, to use $4 billion in federal funds to support the auto industry in promoting the sale of new energy vehicles, and to reach 1 million hybrid cars in the United States by 2015. Clearly, the core focus of Obama\\'s future energy plan is on new energy-powered cars. Records show that fuel cells are recognized worldwide as efficient, convenient, and environmentally friendly green energy devices. It is a device that generates electricity by using hydrogen and oxygen to produce water. The principle is the reverse reaction of the electrolysis of water in the middle school curriculum. Because the fuel is converted into electrical energy through a chemical reaction and then output, it is called a \"fuel cell\". Currently, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), alkaline fuel cells (AFC), and other fuel cells are widely researched and developed. Among them, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have the advantages of high energy conversion efficiency (generally 40%~50%, while the internal combustion engine is only 18%~24%), no pollution, fast start-up, long battery life, high specific power, specific energy, etc., because they directly convert the chemical energy in fuel and oxidant into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions without going through combustion, and have become the most widely used type of fuel cell. This technology has been recognized by developed countries such as the United States and Canada as the preferred clean energy system of the 21st century.']\n"

      "['', '正向', \"Experience exchange: The judicial examination is a process of wit and courage. I participated in the judicial examination for the first time this year and scored 434 points. I think the judicial examination is a process of fighting with intelligence and courage. Now I will share my experience in three stages with you all! I started preparing from mid-March, because it was my first time taking the exam, and I didn't have much confidence, so I started preparing early. Then we were also feeling our way across the river, with no systematic framework in mind for the content of the exam. Sometimes it felt like we were grabbing at straws. Perhaps our foundation was still quite good, and sometimes we got some unexpected results. In this way, the hazy two and a half months passed. Then a friend suggested that I sign up for a class, which might be helpful to me. I signed up for a class that meets on weekends and evenings, which can be arranged freely. I can decide to rest on my own when I am tired. In this way, I learn at the pace of the teacher. With the guidance of the teacher, the learning efficiency has greatly improved, and some places that were not understood were solved effortlessly, learning like a fish in water! This year's卷三 scored 122 points. The second stage was from July to August, which was less than three months away from the exam, and the Olympics was about to start. In the previous period, I went to look for a study room, and it took several weeks to move around, and my study plan was once disrupted. I had even gone to the Haidian Library, but it was too far from my place, and it took 4 hours to go back and forth by bus, which was not worth it. In the hot weather, I was even more irritable. After thinking and thinking, I could only read at home. Although it was quiet in my room at home, there was no one to communicate with me. I could only send text messages or surf the Internet to communicate with the bar exam companions every day. In this way, I could know their progress, see if I was lagging behind, and see which knowledge points I did not master well. Every day, I only stipulated that I should read for six hours, but I must be efficient. The rest of the time was rewarded to watch the Olympic games. I basically did not miss any important games. In the third stage, it was September. After I returned to Beijing, I did the real questions from 2003 to 2007 carefully, and found the relevant knowledge and looked at the places where I made mistakes. I just briefly looked at the rest of the time, I think the fourth volume is not necessary to put in too much effort, because if the basic skills of the first three volumes are well done, the fourth volume basically has no big problem, as long as it can be clean and clear handwriting! As the saying goes, ten years of work off the stage for one minute on the stage. Impromptu performance is also important, and at this time, it's about psychological quality. I was still a bit nervous. The second volume just came out, and I heard the teacher say that someone did not use an A4 pencil to fill in the admission number in the first volume. I suddenly realized that I did not fill it in. I kept thinking whether the first volume would be invalid, so I had杂念 in my mind when I took the second volume, blaming my carelessness. As a result, I performed abnormally in the second volume, and the criminal procedure was a bit off. After the exam, it turned out to be a false alarm. The invigilator said that they also filled it in for those who did not fill in the admission number. I was very regretful that I had failed the second volume, but I thought it was useless, and I could only try to turn the situation around in the next exam. I picked up my spirits and looked at the subjects I would take the next day. As a result, I adjusted quickly the next day and wrote very smoothly! This year's judicial examination can be considered a satisfactory conclusion, but the road of law in the future is still long, and continuous learning is needed! Keep moving forward! The journey is long and arduous, but I will continue to seek and explore! For more information, please visit the legal channel of Sina.com, legal examination forum, legal examination blog circle. Special notice: Due to the continuous adjustment and change of various aspects, all the examination information provided by Sina.com is for reference only, and candidates are advised to refer to the officially published information by the competent authority.\"]\n"

Last week, according to China Central Television, 13 provinces have completed the provincial integration of cable TV networks, while 10 provinces are advancing with the work. When viewed separately, the speed of the integration of the two aspects is not small, but the entire process of three-network integration in China can only be described as slow. The difficult problem is still the original difficult problem. The old expert in the industry, Shuhua Ying, revealed it in one sentence: to achieve the integration of three networks, the first thing to discuss is the issue of unified supervision. Unified regulatory bodies are the institutional foundation of the convergence of three networks. From the experience of the convergence of three networks in the past, setting up a converged regulatory body and implementing unified regulation of networks are the foundations for the breakthrough of the convergence of three networks, and typical countries include the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan, etc. In 2003, the United Kingdom established a converged regulatory body, OFCOM, based on the 2003 Communications Act, which completely broke down the various barriers that existed in the information sector, allowing technology and business to be further integrated. And the FCC, Federal Communications Commission, which is a convergence regulator in the United States, originally regulated public telecommunications, dedicated telecommunications, broadcasting, and television. Japan established the Information and Communications Policy Bureau and the Integrated Communications Bureau under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and also regulates the telecommunications and broadcasting industries. But in China, progress has been slow due to obstacles related to interests and policies. Prof. Shuhua Ying said that the coordination of departmental interests in the integration of the three networks is still a big problem, because the radio and television and telecommunications are managed by two different departments. The direct consequence of the unresolved problem of the strict barriers between radio and television and telecommunications is that the problem of the integration of the three networks, which has been debated for more than ten years, will be indefinitely shelved. Therefore, to truly achieve the convergence of the three networks, the information industry, telecommunications, broadcasting, and new media that rely on the network need a higher-level regulatory body to exercise regulatory powers. A national information supervision committee should be established to use this regulatory platform for simple supervision, achieving the separation of government and business. Mutual access to achieve market-oriented operation is a prerequisite. In the practice of the convergence of the three networks, most countries directly allow mutual access. The UK legislation explicitly stipulates that traditional broadcasting and telecommunications can enter each other, and adopts a competitive regulatory approach for the telecommunications industry, while the access to the broadcasting industry is relatively stricter. There are no legal barriers for telecommunications companies in Germany and India to provide integrated services. The development of the convergence of the three networks should fully play the role of market mechanisms, which are the prerequisite for promoting the convergence of the three networks. In terms of domestic reality, the integration of the three networks has indeed changed the external relationship between the broadcasting and television and telecommunications, but the intrinsic characteristics of both sides remain independent. But the trend of the convergence of the three networks is irreversible, and the demand for the convergence of the three networks is more urgent in the context of the current financial crisis. Although the Radio and Television Administration has been promoting reforms, it has also been reported that the Radio and Television Administration is both an athlete and a referee, which is not in line with the laws of the market economy. The suspension of IPTV by Huangshi Radio and Television Administration and the forced promotion of digital television by Putian Radio and Television Administration can be seen from this. The radio and television authorities should accelerate the pace of market-oriented reform. It is feasible to achieve \"separation of production and broadcasting\" in radio and television, that is, separating content from transmission. With this, the integration of the three networks will be a natural outcome. Tripartite network integration transcends all interests. Currently, the recovery of the global economy mainly benefits from the short-term effects of various countries\\' economic stimulus programs. A series of domestic policies of the country are related to stimulating domestic demand and creating new growth points. Issuing 3G licenses and accelerating the integration of the three networks are all moves in this direction, which are decisions above the group\\'s interests. Standing from this perspective, it is not difficult to understand the tight integration timetable set by the country. The integration of the three networks is extremely difficult for the broadcasting and television network, which is currently a four-level (provincial, municipal, county, and district) independent administration system across the country. The unification of the network must first reform the system, separate from the administrative and public institutions, and establish a corporate management model. That is, to separate from the Radio and Television Administration and establish an independent network group to form the \"fourth network operator\" to participate in the competition of the network industry. For the telecommunications industry, the current content bottleneck is still a key constraint on further development of the telecommunications industry, especially without the power of \"play\" and \"broadcast\". And in terms of content creation, the telecom industry is also a novice. For the telecommunications industry, the most appropriate phrase is to strengthen the transformation of the entire IP network, improve the operational capabilities of all businesses, and integrate the business provision capabilities of personal, family, enterprise, and vertical fields. But these are not enough to stop the inevitable trend of China\\'s three networks integration. It now seems that the formation of a market mechanism is not a one-day job, and unified regulation at the level of national will needs to be implemented first.']\n"

      "['杰伊·南卡罗,大卫·古德沃特,古德沃特,瑞恩·卡罗,塞巴斯蒂安·特伦,特伦,书聿', '正向', \"Google is lobbying in Nevada for its self-driving car project. Sina Tech News, Beijing time, May 12, 2018: Google is quietly lobbying to make Nevada the first state in the US to allow self-driving cars on the road. Legislative lobbying through these legislative proposals, Google hopes that Nevada will allow drivers to control the car by sending text messages without being punished. Less than a year earlier, Google had admitted that it was developing a car that could drive safely without any human intervention. Google responded to a journalist's interview last year that it had tested a hybrid self-driving car on the roads in California, with a total mileage of 140,000 miles (about 225,000 kilometers). More than 1000 miles of the journey were driven entirely by the robot. Another Google engineer tested the autonomous driving feature on a 50-mile commute to and from work. Google did not disclose its plans for commercializing the project at the time. But the company confirmed on Tuesday that it was lobbying the state of Nevada for legislation. However, Google executives refused to reveal why they chose Nevada as the destination. Jay Nancarrow, a Google spokesperson, said that the project is still in the testing phase. Google also hired lobbyist David Goldwater to help push two bills, which are expected to be voted on at the Nevada Legislature’s legislative session in mid-June. One of them is to allow the testing of autonomous vehicles, and the other is to allow drivers to send text messages to control electric vehicles. Goodwater said on April 7 that autonomous driving is safer than manual driving, and consumes less fuel, and can even promote economic development. Although the automotive industry is accelerating the popularization of artificial intelligence technology, fully relying on automated systems to drive cars still raises questions about safety and accident liability. Regulators and policymakers warn that current technological developments are advancing very rapidly and may exceed the scope of existing legal regulations. They think that if driverless cars become a reality, legislation will have to be enacted as soon as possible. Commercial policy analysts believe that Nevada is the first state to consider promoting commercial autonomous vehicles. This car can park itself, drive itself, and even serve as an autonomous taxi for the casinos in Las Vegas. In a sense, it is a good model and example. It acknowledges the need to create a process for testing such a car and to carve out an area in Nevada for testing. Professor Ryan Calo of Stanford Law School said. Google’s six driverless cars are both Toyota Prius and Audi TT models, which are easy to identify because of the radar detectors on the roof. These cars are also equipped with a variety of radar and camera sensors, as well as a large number of computer devices. In the test project, each car is responsible for one driver, and there is also a Google employee responsible for monitoring the equipment on the passenger seat. Because of the driver's participation, Google was able to sidestep the legal risks. The project is overseen by Sebastian Thrun, an artificial intelligence expert, who led a team of students and engineers to victory in the DARPA Grand Challenge, an autonomous vehicle competition held in the United States, when he was a professor at Stanford University in 2005. Since then, Tren has devoted more of his energy to Google’s projects, even giving up his tenured professorship at Stanford University and hiring many experts to help him complete this project. Tren has repeatedly stated in public that driverless cars will improve energy efficiency and reduce traffic accidents. He has also called for the establishment of complex carpooling systems to cut the number of cars on American roads in half. Google's ambitious autonomous car program shows that a new automotive industry is emerging in the Silicon Valley region. Mercedes, Volkswagen and other car manufacturers have already established laboratories in the region. IBM also launched a battery research and development project. With the push from the American electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, the Nummi car factory, which was originally jointly established by General Motors and Toyota, has also reopened. (Shu Yu)\"]\n"

      "['井楠,简岑', '正向', \"It is not easy to exchange foreign currency for the most cost-effective bank in China before the Spring Festival, and many citizens are enthusiastic about signing up for group overseas tours. How to exchange foreign currency and how much foreign currency to exchange are the questions of most newbies in overseas travel. Journalists have learned that there are many tricks, and tourists should exchange in advance in mainland China to save at least 10% of the transaction fees. By Jin Nan, a reporter, it is understood that when traveling abroad for tourism, there are generally three ways to exchange foreign currency, one is to exchange in the bank in China, the second is to exchange in the bank at the airport, and the third is to exchange with local tour guides after going abroad. From the perspective of tourists, among the three methods, it is the most cost-effective to exchange currency within China, and the least cost-effective to exchange at the airport. For example, the trip to Thailand favored by the residents of Guangzhou. The current exchange rate between the RMB and the Thai baht is 4.84. If you handle the transaction in the bank in the Chinese mainland, including a transaction fee of 0.3% to 0.6%, the price at which citizens buy is generally between 4.81 and 4.83. 100 RMB can be exchanged for at least 481 Thai baht. And the airport banks in various countries have high operating costs, and the exchange rate between foreign exchange buying and selling is generally 15% to 30% apart, which means that if citizens exchange 100 yuan at the airport, they can only get 410-420 yuan. As for the local guides, it is absolutely impossible for them not to earn money from foreigners. Generally, 100 RMB can only be exchanged for about 450 Thai Baht. According to the reporters, although the Chinese tour guides in various places have differences, earning 10% of the foreign exchange difference is an unwritten rule in the industry worldwide; the difference should also be shared with the team leaders in China. It is best to make an appointment with the bank branch one day in advance. Unless the time is really urgent, it is recommended that tourists exchange foreign currency in advance at the bank on the mainland. Currently, in Guangzhou, exchanging foreign currency at the China Bank is still the most convenient and cost-effective way, with transaction fees adjusted daily, generally ranging from 0.3% to 0.5%. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, and foreign banks also offer similar services, but some have slightly higher fees and some have limited business outlets, requiring a longer waiting time. Each branch of the bank has a limited amount of foreign exchange. Customers are advised to make an appointment one day in advance by calling the bank's service hotline for人工服务, choose the nearest business branch, leave your contact number, and wait for the bank's notification. Once you receive the notice, please bring RMB and your ID to the counter to handle the matter. Of course, most bank branches have sufficient Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, and euros, and sometimes you can handle the business on the spot without an appointment. How much extra foreign currency should be prepared for overseas travel in addition to the tour fee at a ratio of 1 to 1? Chen Zhen, a wealth management expert of Minsheng Bank, believes that for most Chinese tourists on the mainland, preparing an additional cost of 1 to 1 for overseas travel according to the cost of joining a tour group is appropriate. For example, the cost of a 6-day tour of Honshu in Japan, which is signed up for in Guangzhou, is generally 7,899 yuan per person. After everyone has paid the group fee, it is best to prepare about 8000 RMB in Japanese yen. This is because, apart from the travel agency fee, the cost of going abroad is generally divided into three parts. First are the self-funded projects. The maximum budget for self-funded items specified by general travel groups is 1/3 to 1/2 of the travel fee. If a tourist pays 8000 yuan for a trip, he needs to prepare at least 2400 yuan more if he wants to play all the items. In addition, mineral water, snacks, and other instant consumption are also major components of overseas spending, generally at a standard of 100 yuan per person per day. For a 10-day trip to Europe, you need to add at least 1000 yuan, and for a 6-day trip to Japan, you still need 600 yuan. Finally, tourists have to shop when they go abroad, and the differences are quite large depending on the country they visit, but in general, preparing one-third to half of the tour fee is always enough. The total cost of the three projects is roughly equivalent to the total cost of the group fee, forming a 1:1 ratio.\"]\n"

      "['宋华,斯亚克斯', '正向', '40,000 crabs washed up dead on the Kent coast in the southeast of England (photo report) Global Times special reporter Song Hua reports. According to the UK Daily Mail on January 5, there have been multiple mysterious animal deaths in many parts of the world in recent times. First, thousands of magpies fell dead in Arkansas, USA, and then thousands of dead fish were washed up on the shore. Now, another 40,000 dead king crabs (also known as devil crabs) have been washed up on the Kent coast in southeastern England. Reports said that tens of thousands of dead crabs were washed up on the shore of Kent, UK, and environmental experts believe that the cold weather in the UK may be the cause of the梭子蟹\\'s death. The梭子蟹 is believed to be the victim of the coldest December in the UK in 120 years, with the cold weather causing the sea water temperature to be much lower than usual. Tony Smith, a warden on the English coast, said, \"We suspect that climate change and warmer weather have lured the crabs to the coast, and they may have entered these waters in search of algae.\" We believe that the sudden drop in temperature caused the crabs to die from cold. At the same time, 50 crows\\' bodies were found on a street in Stockholm, Sweden on May 5. The veterinarian investigating the incident told the Associated Press that it was not yet clear what caused the birds’ deaths, but that fireworks had been set off at the site on the evening of April 4. Besides fireworks, the cold weather and the difficulty in finding food may also be the cause of the death of the birds, according to the veterinarian. Before this, there were several incidents of mass animal deaths in the United States. 450 birds fell dead in Louisiana on April 4th, the cause is unknown. On New Year\\'s Eve, more than 3,000 red-winged blackbirds fell from the sky in Arkansas. US officials admit that they may not be able to determine the cause of the bird\\'s death. Moreover, wildlife experts hundreds of miles west of the incident site are still struggling to find out why 100,000 dead fish were washed up on the riverbank.']\n"

The Nets lost to the Warriors in a 79-111 defeat. The Nets have suffered 10 consecutive losses. Sina Sports News, January 23, 2023: The Nets lost to the Warriors in a 79-111 defeat at home. What do you think of Yi Jianlian's performance in the whole game, scoring 2 points, 11 rebounds, 2 blocks, hitting his 500th career NBA shot, grabbing his 800th rebound, and 300 free throws? >>> The Nets (3-39) have lost ten in a row, which is already their third time losing ten or more games in a row this season. In their last 21 games, the Nets have won only one. Brook Lopez scored 21 points and grabbed 6 rebounds, while Courtney Lee scored 17 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. Yi Jianlian scored only 2 points from 6 shots, but grabbed 11 rebounds and had 2 steals and 2 blocks. In addition, after this game, Yi Jianlian's personal NBA career points reached 500, rebounds reached 800, and free throws made reached 300, becoming the second Chinese player to reach this series of milestones after Yao Ming. The Warriors (13-28) closed it easily. Stephen Curry played for 48 minutes, scoring 32 points and making 7 assists, Cory Maggette scored 29 points, and Anthony Toliver scored 12 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Monta Ellis played for 24 minutes and scored 4 points with 5 assists. In the last three games, the Warriors could only field 8 players, 3 of whom came from NBDL. Monta Ellis played all three games without a single minute of rest. Before, only Allen Iverson played all 3 games in 1997, and no one has played all 4 games for 23 years. Ellis had a chance to break the record, but he failed to do so due to a sprained right ankle. In the first quarter, the two teams were still in contention. In the last 3 minutes and 34 seconds of the quarter, the Nets only scored one basket, and the Warriors led 26-21 at the end of the quarter. Yi Jianlian attempted a shot and missed, and failed to score. Ellis was also off, missing all four shots in the quarter and failing to score. Yi Jianlian still failed to score in one more shot in the second period. The Warriors had a 19-point lead, 42-23, with 7:14 left in the quarter. After that, Lopez scored one point and Kutney Li hit three consecutive three-pointers. The Nets scored 13-4 and narrowed the score to 36-44. In the last 6 minutes, the Warriors only scored one basket, but they still maintained their advantage, leading 50-44 at halftime. With 10:17 left in the third quarter, Yi Jianlian finally scored a basket from within one step of the three-point line, which was his first score of the game. But the Warriors scored 4 straight to extend their lead to double digits. Then the Warriors continued to attack fiercely and ended the period with a 10-0 run, taking a 23-point lead, 88-65. In the last 3 minutes and 39 seconds of this quarter, the Nets did not score a single point. Beginning with 8:41 left in the fourth quarter, the Warriors failed to make a field goal in 3:35, yet the Nets failed to cut the deficit to within 20 points. With 5:06 left in the game, McGee hit a three-pointer, and the Warriors launched a 9-0 run to take a 104-73 lead with a 31-point advantage. The outcome was never in doubt, and the Warriors were forced to keep Curry and others on the court due to a lack of sufficient substitutes.

Wang Qing reported that New Zealand and Paraguay drew, and the Slovaks celebrated wildly. For the first time as an independent country, they entered the knockout stage of the World Cup, and they were truly a surprise. Assistant: The head coach Weiss was right: \"I personally admire Li Tie very much.\" But they have to win, we don\\'t. Who has the loose mind, who can take this game. From the process, Slovakia is more relaxed. Umberto Bossi, the Northern League representative and chairman of the National Federation Reform Commission, said before the match that Italy would buy Slovakia to qualify, and a large number of Slovaks will appear in the Italian Serie A next season, Wei Si was surprised: \"What do you mean?\" Is it a joke? I don\\'t know this person, and I have no idea what he wants to do. I only know the Italian Prime Minister from TV. Ves, the former Czechoslovak international, became a national hero, and no one would remember his brutality. After the second loss to Paraguay, he glared at the local reporters and even fought with them, criticizing the reporters: \"Thank you very much, you are better than foreign reporters.\" Having written so much bad stuff, do you have the face to interview my son now? What a shit, I want to punch you in the face\", and then wrestled with a journalist named Spachek. All cases were recorded by two FIFA officials, and Wei is likely to be punished. Viesse was firm: \"I regret it, but I will not admit it. Those people sent us negative signals that made us uncomfortable. Football itself should be joyful.\" With the World Cup 16th place slot in hand, Wei Si would not be bothered even if he hit someone. Vittek scored twice against the defending champion and once against New Zealand, scoring three goals to become the top scorer and stealing the spotlight from the top star Hamšík. Italy paid too much attention to Hamsik, who scored 30 goals in 107 league games in 3 seasons in Italy, and scored 12 goals in the just-ended Serie A season, equal to Eto\\'o and Park, the top scorer in midfield. What is even more terrifying is that he has a nightmare record against many Italian national team players. Hamsik admitted that his most beautiful goal was in the second to last round of the 2008 match against Milan. Milan lost the key match to lose the Champions League seat, and Hamsik intercepted the ball from Gattuso in the middle of the field and ran straight to score a powerful shot. Hamshic\\'s favorite target is Juventus, with 4 goals, 3 of which decided the game in the just concluded season, and 3 goals were scored in front of the Cannavaro and Chiellini center-back combination. Malacarne was not spared either, when Hamšík scored against him in November 2008, but last December, when Napoli drew 3-3 with Cagliari, Malacarne was in top form and saved all of Hamšík’s shots. True to the saying that enemies do not meet unless they are fated to. Hamšík was very excited after the victory, \"My position doesn\\'t matter, each coach has his own ideas.\" I am more in Paraguay this time, and a bit further back this time. It\\'s not a question of being 10 meters to the left or right, but the attitude of the whole team. Italy was like a mountain in front of everyone, and now we have climbed the mountain. There are quite a few Napoli players in the World Cup, with four in Italy and one in Uruguay, Gargano, but only Hamshik is a starter.']\n"

      "['尼克-杨,杨,杨摇,杨才,兰迪,沈洋', '正向', 'Single champion: Nick Young, who is familiar with the style of play of the west coast, plays well. The assistant coach is great. Sina Sports News, March 3, Beijing time (Washington time on the 2nd), in the fourth quarter of the game between the Wizards and the Warriors, it was undoubtedly the time belonging to Nick Young, this kind of crazy player, as long as he has a sense of shooting, no matter who stands in front of him, he is still unsolvable. Score 14 points in a single period and make a key shot in the last 6.9 seconds, bringing the game to the last second. Nick Young scored 31 points for the team, although they lost the game. Nick Young shook his head after the game, and even when he talked about his 31 points, he didn\\'t look happy at all. \"We lost the game, 31 points don\\'t matter much.\" Yang\\'s crazy performance in the last period made the Warriors feel the crisis after leading the Wizards by 20 points. While clamping down on Yang, but no matter how many hands were in front of him, Yang could still make it. From 11:49 of the fourth quarter, the performance continued until the last 6 seconds. With 6.9 seconds left, the Wizards were trailing by 4 points, 99-103. All the fans thought that victory was hopeless and left the stadium. At this time, Yang made a three-point shot, and two players\\' hands were covering Yang\\'s face. However, the ball still went into the net. The whole stadium was沸腾boiling. And Yang also revealed his trademark smile like a child. Unfortunately, after that, the ball never made its way back to Yang’s hands. The Wizards kept using the foul strategy, and the Warriors made 3 out of 4 free throws. The Wizards lost the game in disappointment. After the game, the reporters all wanted Yang to talk about his crazy performance in the fourth quarter, but usually Yang, who was always happy, was not happy. When I scored that goal, I felt good and thought we still had a chance, but unfortunately, we didn\\'t get a key rebound and lost the game. This is really a pity. Yang shook his head. A reporter asked why Yang found his rhythm in the second half of the game today. Yang said, \"Before, our whole team played poorly, and the attack was somewhat chaotic. I wanted to shoot, but the ball happened to bounce out.\" In the second half, I felt my hand gradually warming up, and I felt that although we lost a lot, the game was not over, and I should do something as soon as possible. The Golden State Warriors are from California, and Nick Young is also a native of California. Facing the Warriors, the star felt more familiar and warm. They play the basketball of the West Coast, I know very well and am very familiar with the basketball style of the West Coast, so I usually perform well in this kind of game. And you know, my family is over there, and I get so excited thinking about them watching my game, so I tell myself I can’t relax. Unfortunately, the team lost the game today. When it comes to the assistant coach\\'s guidance, Nick Young is very positive. He said, \"Randy has always told us to stay confident, always encouraged us, and not to think that because the other team is leading by a lot, we will definitely lose. That\\'s just temporary. Although we didn\\'t win the game, he is a good coach, and the belief he told us is very important.\" \"(Washington correspondent Shen Yang reports from the front)\"']\n"

      "['爱默生', '正向', 'Hot topic: What is the first secret to success in the postgraduate entrance examination? Confidence is the first secret to success. —- [US] Emerson American writer Emerson speaks very incisively, but is very philosophical. To savor, to give us endless thinking and encouragement. For students preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination, the phenomenon of weak foundation and thin base is widespread, and some candidates are still on the job, putting down the textbooks for many years, and reviewing for the postgraduate entrance examination is not an easy thing. Are we going to give up? No, such candidates are obviously not confident! Count the domestic postgraduates, not every one of them is naturally smart. Why can they be admitted, but not themselves? In Emerson\\'s words, it is confidence that is the first secret of success in the postgraduate entrance examination. Confidence, self-confidence, only those who believe they can succeed will have infinite power, and will let us prepare for success rather than find excuses for failure. For students in school, there are so many times that can be used for postgraduate entrance examination review, why sigh and move forward hesitantly? Last year, there was a student on the R&D Education Network who worked for a company in Tianjin and signed a three-year work contract with the company, and resignation required a huge breach of contract penalty, so he did not really leave the factory and resign for the postgraduate entrance examination until the end of August when the contract expired. Before calling the online school, I did not know that remote tutoring could be listened to anytime and anywhere, so I only started preparing at the end of August. For his first postgraduate entrance examination, his English was basically zero, and he had learned politics and mathematics since the second year of college, but he had put them down for five years, and at that time, he only barely passed with a score of around 60. After making a call to sign up, I enrolled in the experimental class, hoping to be admitted smoothly with the help of the homeroom teacher in the remaining time. The head teacher asked him if he had any psychological burden to start reviewing now. He said very frankly, \"Since it\\'s already too late, we have to think of a way to catch up. Thinking too much about other things is just a waste of thought.\" I resigned, I have time, and I know the difficulties of work, so I will definitely be more willing to learn than them, so I believe I will not fall behind and catch up. This student, relying on his confidence and perseverance, won a master\\'s degree in automation at Northeastern University under the guidance of the head teacher. Northeastern University\\'s automation is well-known nationwide. When someone is admitted, this confidence and perseverance are worth learning from many people. Many people give up on themselves, thinking they won\\'t pass the exam, but at the same time, they are crushing their own confidence and shattering their dreams of becoming a graduate student, what a pity! In Old Man Travels, it says: The world has a limited number of talents, and one should not undervalue oneself! It means that geniuses are rare, and everyone is about the same, so you should never look down on yourself! So when you doubt your own ability, you can say this sentence to yourself, increase your confidence, dispel your inferiority complex, and bravely move forward on the road to postgraduate entrance examination!

      "['阿Q,鲁迅,赵太爷', '正向', 'Shock the System: The so-called Aq spirit is not to be encouraged in the postgraduate entrance examination. Aq is a character created by Lu Xun. The so-called Aq spirit has been popular among the Chinese for decades. At the beginning, he was a purely tragic figure, and most of the arguments around him tended to be critical. But with the passage of time and the change of people’s views, the A-Q spirit is often beautified as self-comfort or the middle way. Is it really so? We do not make arbitrary judgments, but in the postgraduate entrance examination, this kind of Qian Zhong spirit is absolutely not to be taken. There should be no \"self-esteem complex\". The first characteristic of Ah Q is \"self-esteem complex\". Ah Q was a very humble person. He had no home and no fixed occupation. He only did short-term work for others, and no one really remembered him. However, Ah Q was very proud, and all the residents of Wenzhuang were not in his eyes, and even when Zhao Taier’s son passed the examination, he did not show respect in spirit, thinking that \"my son will be much richer than him.\" This kind of meaningless self-respect cannot bring us any spiritual pleasure, nor does it have any meaning in changing reality. For example, we often hear students who are preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination say that if they were like this or that, they would also be like this or that, or that \"University ××\" has something good, I am not willing to go, and so on, this kind of meaningless boasting. Here, it warns the students not to be like Ah Q, not to think about how to strive and work hard when they are not as good as others, but to slander or talk big without reason, and in the end, you will achieve nothing and live in envy forever. It is not about \"being weak and fearing the strong\". The second characteristic of Ah Q is \"being weak and fearing the strong\". Ah Q was fond of quarreling and fighting with others, but he would always assess his opponent. If the other person was talkative, Ah Q would curse them, and if the other person was weak, Ah Q would beat them. But when he met the “fake foreigner” on the road, he blurted out “bald”, and was heard by the “fake foreigner”, who raised his “funeral stick”. He immediately curled his neck and waited to be beaten, and he took several whacks without daring to resist. In real life, such people who bully the weak and fear the strong are everywhere, and they are really annoying. Moreover, we say that \"being weak and afraid of strong\" is not just reflected in dealing with people. For example, in the process of postgraduate entrance examination, many students also have the characteristics of \"being weak and afraid of strong\". For the subjects that they are interested in and find easy to learn, they can always review them first, review them more, and be willing to review them. For those difficult subjects, they always want to avoid their weak links, always hope to find a shortcut, and cannot take it seriously. They are always hesitating between making up their minds to study hard and self-denial and forgiveness. “Bullied the weak and afraid of the strong” is a kind of giving up mentality that is unwilling to try one\\'s best and deceive oneself, which has a serious negative impact on your subject review and postgraduate entrance examination success. Students must get rid of this bad habit. One cannot be a \"cheater\" as ArQ\\'s third characteristic is \"good at speculation\". For example, in his attitude toward the revolution, Ah Q had always been deeply opposed to it. But when he saw the panic-stricken looks of the crowd of birds and women in Nvzhuang (when the revolution was imminent), he thought, \"Revolution is also good. Get rid of the lives of these damned people, too repulsive!\" Too hateful! And I, too, would surrender to the revolutionaries. The purpose of Ah Q\\'s revolution was merely for his own benefit, \"I take what I want and I like who I like.\" Of course, the cunning and deceit we refer to here are more focused on the learning level, but the principle is the same, which is that cunning and deceit are not good. Cheating first of all falls into a wrong attitude. For the review of the postgraduate entrance examination, too many students cannot be down-to-earth, always thinking that without effort and hard work, good results can be achieved, little do they know that time is wasted in such a way. There is a path through the mountain of books for diligence, and a sea of learning without the end of hardship as a boat. In order to succeed, one must work hard without cease, and must not have the mentality of侥幸and speculation. Cannot \"Self-deception\" The fourth feature of Ah Q is \"self-deception\", that is, \"spiritual victory method\". When A-Q lost a fight with someone, he thought to himself, \"I have finally been hit by my son. The world is really not as it should be; my son has actually hit his father. Then he was satisfied, as if he had won a victory. Many people advocate this kind of mental victory, but in learning, this kind of mental victory is absolutely not to be tolerated. We come into contact with many classmates, and there are always such situations when reviewing. When encountering some difficult or not very good questions, we will comfort ourselves that it\\'s okay, this type of question is too biased and not easy to be tested; Sometimes we are lazy and do not want to review, and we will tell ourselves that it\\'s okay, I will rest for a few days, and it will not have any impact, etc. This is typical self-deception. Self-deception is essentially a kind of indulgence and irresponsibility towards oneself, which is not good for either study or life. I hope that all students can stay away from this kind of \"self-deception\". The fifth characteristic of Ah Q, the slave of learning, is \"slavery\". This is manifested in some students who are not proactive in learning and always feel forced to learn passively. Before university, everyone was learning under the supervision and control of teachers and parents. They did learn, but they did not develop good self-study habits. As soon as they were out of the supervision, they started to slack off and think about relaxing. This state may not be obvious before entering university, but once in university, away from the once tense learning environment and without the supervision of teachers and parents, a large part of the students will be lost in the enjoyment and relaxation. Many people say that today\\'s college students are very \"servile\" in their studies, mainly because they are not proactive in learning and cannot learn proactively, always passively and involuntarily. But for the postgraduate entrance examination, such a long-term process that requires hard struggle, it is necessary to require everyone to actively and proactively learn, because no one will remind you, supervise you, or help you, everything depends on yourself, so do not be a \"slave\" of learning, be the master. It is precisely because of these typical spirits of Ah Q that he has a tragic life. We should learn from it and not be Ah Q of the new era, and we should not bring Ah Q spirit to our study and life.

      "['蓉蓉,李琼', '负向', 'The \"sunshine prodigy\" is difficult to adapt to the life of studying abroad and returns empty-handed. New students of American top universities have traveled abroad. Foreign universities have been open for a period of time. Facing a new life and learning environment, can new students who just go abroad adapt, especially some little students? Journalists have learned that although overseas high school education does not have the pressure of the college entrance examination in China, the academic workload is actually not light. Academic and life pressures make it difficult for many international students, who have never left their parents since childhood, to adapt and generate many problems. Rongrong, a 17-year-old exchange student (a pseudonym), is facing such pressure. She told the reporter in detail about her experience from going to study abroad with high spirits to reluctantly returning home. Her experience may be of some reference to those parents and children who are planning to study abroad. I am 17 years old, and I should be in a high school in my country, studying in the second year of high school, but a few days ago, I was hiding in the dormitory of a foreign country, sobbing in pain. At that time, I hadn\\'t seen my parents and old classmates for a long time, and I also didn\\'t want to see the new teachers and classmates. Finally, my condition was known to the school, and as a result, I was advised to return home and take a leave of absence. With great enthusiasm: \"Sun God Child\" went to America. Since I was a little girl, I was always considered a girl with extraordinary intelligence, and the \"top chair\" in the class was always mine without much effort. I think I look pretty good, and because I often ride a bicycle for outings, my skin has been tanned into a healthy wheat color, and I have been given the美誉of \"Sunshine Child\" by those around me. I really like this nickname. My parents had high expectations for me, and I didn’t feel much pressure. With my usual level of performance, standing out was not out of reach. Though my city is not big, everyone is very concerned about the education of children. Affected by the surrounding environment, my parents asked me whether I wanted to go abroad to complete my high school studies when I finished my second year of junior high school, and then naturally choose a suitable university for further study. Of course, my answer is \"yes\". How tempting it is to go to a foreign country and receive even better education! Actually, I had already calculated it in the morning, to first read in high schools in the top 100 in the United States, and then choose a prestigious Ivy League school for further study, and to shape myself into an elite with a broad knowledge of both Chinese and Western cultures. My parents strongly support my idea. Although our family is not very wealthy, most of the top 100 high schools in the United States are private, and the tuition is very expensive. However, my parents still gritted their teeth and raised a huge amount of tuition. After a long and complex application, interview, visa, and other stages, I arrived in the United States, which I had dreamed of during my third-year summer vacation. Back then, I was full of confidence and ambition. Gradually, I felt lost: I always heard that China\\'s basic education was world-leading, so I never thought I would have any obstacles in my studies. In fact, it turned out not to be the case. I encountered difficulties right from the start - course selection. High schools in the United States are elective systems, and as long as all the credits are completed when graduating, it is up to the students to decide what courses to take each year, with no guidance from teachers at all. Is learning always what the teacher says and what the student learns in my concept? For this, my parents far away at home could not help me, and my classmates and teachers around me were unwilling to help me, as they believed that it was my own matter and that others were not convenient to intervene. So, in fear, I chose some subjects that I was quite good at back in China, and I also chose a medium to high level in terms of course depth. But after reading it for a week, I found something was wrong. First of all, there is the language. Although I have no problem with English, the speed at which I can listen to and think in English is obviously not fast enough to keep up with the teacher\\'s explanation. Therefore, I have to spend more time reading books. The subjects are very deep and difficult, and the worst part is that there is a large amount of homework every day, and the homework is not just doing exercises, but also includes looking up materials, doing practical work, and presenting one\\'s own arguments, and there are no standard answers for these, and students need to submit their answers by combining their own learning and abilities. Now I am completely lost. \"First\" seems to be a recollection of a past life. Total collapse: drinking to drown my sorrows was discouraged. Another thing that was not to my liking was extracurricular activities. Because the high school I applied to was very prestigious, and it was full of children from middle-class American families who had received very good education from a very young age, which was not just academic, but all-round. These children are both literary and martial, each excelling in a sport and an artistic subject. For someone who has always been focused on math, physics, and chemistry, and ignored everything else that is not related to exams, extracurricular interests and hobbies are almost blank. Although I often take pride in being \"all-round\" in China, I have only developed a little and am not an expert. With my complete ignorance, my American classmates gave me a restrained but surprised look, which isolated me from their world. I find it difficult to keep up with my studies and I am on the fringes of life, and my pressure is getting bigger and bigger. I tried my best, but I still couldn\\'t finish my homework, and I still couldn\\'t pass the exam. I couldn\\'t keep up with those damn sports, music, and art classes, and even when I ran a marathon, I fainted and had to be sent to the school medical station. Why did I become a weak person in America! I can\\'t understand, I think everyone around me looks down on me, so I am more and more closed, and I stay in the dormitory all day long, staring blankly. I often go to the school playground alone in the middle of the night and cry silently, and then I start to refuse to do all the homework and ignore the classmates who occasionally show concern. Finally, I even refused to continue studying, often skipping classes, secretly buying a large bottle of strong liquor to get drunk, and sobbing under the quilt. Finally, one day the school found me and suggested that I take a leave of absence for a while to adjust my state and mood. And so, the broken me was sent back home... Overseas students should be mentally prepared to deal with the impact of cultural shock between the East and the West. Experts in the industry explain that from the case of the \"sunshine prodigy\", it can be seen that the fundamental reason why she could not adapt to her life in the United States smoothly is that she did not have a full understanding of Western education and culture, and her psychology could not cope with the impact of cultural shock between the East and the West. She hopes to maintain the sense of superiority of \"excellent academic performance\" and \"serve as a model for classmates\" during her study abroad. But she did not understand that the \"first\" in China was very different from the \"first\" abroad. Abroad, being a \"first\" means having a comprehensive ability, such as excellent academic performance, special skills, being well-read and eloquent, strong social skills (even leadership), rich social experience, and social responsibility, rather than just excellent academic performance. She should view her differences from others with a positive attitude, making her inner self stronger, enhancing her stress resistance awareness, learning to view things with a multi-dimensional mindset, and continuously improving herself with effective methods, rather than always negating herself. Parents must communicate fully with their children on the issue of going abroad, and decide whether to go abroad based on their children\\'s personality, English ability, and development direction. For students, it is necessary to browse the website more before going abroad to learn more about the relevant knowledge of foreign education, society, and law. For responsible overseas study service agencies, since they have a large amount of first-hand overseas information and overseas student resources, they should arrange systematic departure counseling services for students before they go abroad, covering aspects such as life, culture, and psychology. Moreover, experts suggest that students should consult with classmates who have already taken the course to get a sense of the difficulty. Newly arrived international students can go to the International Student Affairs Office to ask more questions about course selection, life, and study. You can also choose clubs of your interest, make new friends, integrate into the big family, and accept new cultures. (Reporter: Li Qiong)']\n"

After ten days of silent and unobserved, Hou Zan\\'s lawyer Su Xiangxiang said that on the day of the court\\'s investigation and evidence collection, Hou Yaowen\\'s side was not present. It is analyzed that the defendant may raise an objection to the jurisdiction. On August 4, the plaintiff Hou Zan added two new requests and resubmitted the complaint to the Xicheng Court of Beijing again: 1. All of Hou Yaowen\\'s bank accounts should be investigated, because when the court investigated Hou Yaowen\\'s property before, only four banks were investigated, and the rest of the banks were not investigated; 2. The wedding gifts of friends and relatives at Hou Yaowen\\'s funeral, plus each of Hou Yaowen\\'s disciples paid 10,000 yuan, the total of the two is about 600,000 yuan, which is also in Hou Yaohua\\'s hands, and this should also be added. As a result, the case was postponed for trial and live streaming on the Internet, and both sides entered the stage of organizing the pleadings. Now, after more than ten days, Su Xiangxiang, the lawyer, said that the time for both sides to sort out the evidence had ended by 5 p.m. yesterday, and they needed to submit a new answer to the court. It was also reported that Chen Yijia, the young girlfriend of Hou Yaowen, was not mentioned in the three people who were sued by Hou Zan. There have been speculations online that Chen Yijia was not sued because she was seen to be \"busy\" at the farewell ceremony of Hou Yaowen, while his two ex-wives did not attend, and Hou Zan was moved by this. Su Xiangxiang said there was no such thing. He said that Chen Yijia left the Rose Garden with nothing, \"According to the evidence we currently have, Chen Yijia mainly took some of her own clothes and other personal items when she left the Rose Garden.\" The court may add to it only if it deems it necessary. Recently, Chen Yijia, who is not yet 30 years old, uploaded many travel diaries of the United States on her blog. It seems that she has started her new life after摆脱掉the impact of the case. As for Su’s statement that the two previous wives of Hou Yaowen did not attend the memorial service, it was “expected, after all, everyone now has their own lives.”']\n"

Smallville will return in September, and several major characters will change. Recently, at the San Diego Comic Con, four producers Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson, Todd Slavkin, and Darren Swimmer introduced a new season, which is still very popular with many fans. Although it is still Smallville, many characters will change. It can be confirmed that the male lead Clark will officially transform into Superman in the eighth season. Besides leading a double life, he will also work for the Daily Planet with Lois Lane, played by Erica Durance. Some fans may worry that Smallville will be too much like the 1990s TV series Lois & Clark, but producer Peterson assures that this will not happen. That\\'s not the style of our play, nor is it the style of the characters that our audience is familiar with. He introduced that the two of them would spark when they worked together, and there would also be times of tense relationships, so it would be very interesting to watch, but the overall character style would not change. Besides the sparks between Clark and Louise, the relationship between Clark and Chloe in the eighth season is also very interesting. There will be a lot of hidden pressure between the two of them, sexual pressure, emotional pressure. Peterson introduced. At the convention, the producers did not reveal whether or not the actor who played Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum, would return to the show, but they did reveal that the actress who played Lana Lang, Kristin Kreuk, would return. In the fifth episode of the eighth season, she will appear again, but it is very likely that she will no longer be the Lana that the audience is familiar with. Slavikin introduced, \"She looks different, no longer the Lana we are familiar with.\" She grew up, left the town, and came back as a woman. Obviously, marriage made her a woman, but she was still a child. Lana began a new life, while Oliver Queen, played by Justin Hartley, will explore his past, revealing the origins of the Green Arrow. We will explore how Oliver became the Arrow, why it was him, and how he learned to shoot an arrow. Hartley also talked about the challenges his role faced. Oliver will be a little sad, he will start to review what he has sacrificed for, and wonder whether it is worth it. Supernatural season 8 will return on September 18th.

Besides many world-class stars, there was also a guest who attracted the attention of the reporters, Daisy, the girlfriend of the Belgian player Hanniwell. Joey Hannifield is one of the most famous snooker players in Belgium, having won six Belgian snooker championships, and has also consistently finished in the top three in the European Championship and the World Games. Hanniford also achieved a maximum break of 147 at the European Championship in Germany in 2003 and at the Belgian Championship in 2007. He also does commentary for the Dutch-language Eurosport channel on a regular basis. Additionally, Hannewell is the only Belgian player in the current professional snooker world, reaching the highest world ranking of 53rd in the 03/04 season. After two seasons away from the professional tour, Hannaford returned to the professional tour in the 2009/10 season, following his fourth-place finish in the Pinty\\'s Series in the 2008/09 season. In the 2009-10 season, Hanniford not only qualified for the Chinese Open, but also scored 138 points in the World Championship qualifier, setting a new personal best. Actually, this is not the first time Hannewell has come to China. In the 2000 China Open, Hannewell lost 3-5 to Hendry and was eliminated in the first round. This time, Honeywell was not alone. As a father, he brought his \"child\\'s mother\" Daisy to Beijing, and even brought the baby who was still sucking on the pacifier. Daisy, who has already given birth, is still well taken care of. The black low-cut dress reveals her spicy figure, and it is unknown how many journalists\\' lenses have been killed. It seems that HN威 is planning to take his family on a good tour of the early spring capital. I just hope that next week\\'s Beijing will not be as windy as the last few days, and that a gentle breeze and warm sunshine will be the best weather for a spring outing! However, Hannewell, who was sitting in the players\\' seats, did not seem to attract much attention from the reporters, and everyone\\'s eyes were still focused on the super stars such as Higgins, Ding Junhui and Hendry, which also made Hannewell not the only player to receive such \"cold\" treatment. Although McLoud is the best at snooker among the blacks today, although Vattana and Suprabh are respectively the top players of Thailand in the past and present, their actions and freedom are much more. McLoud was free to move around the hotel, strolling around and listening to music, and no one asked him for an autograph as he passed through the fans. Vatanan and Supper went out with a Thai fan to look for food. (TOP147, Xi Liang)']\n"

Earlier, when promoting his new album in Taiwan, Fang Datong was awarded \"Little Giant Lung\". On his new album, he has made many new attempts. ●After three years, Fang Datong has released a new creation album, \"15\", which he has written all the music and arrangements, and also written more lyrics than usual. So much effort and enthusiasm, but it has sparked controversy. ●Our report: It is really not easy to be a musician. If you don\\'t change, you will be criticized for \"stagnation\"; if you change a little, you will be easily accused of \"shallow\". Actually, for most fans, being moved by a few songs and enjoying dozens of minutes of listening is enough. South Daily News, Zhu Yanxia, intern Huang Danting, wearing black-framed glasses, wearing a checkered shirt, singing soul and R&B music, this is Fang Datong\\'s usual appearance. Not too hot or too cold, this is the most common evaluation given to him and his musical style by the outside world. But this time, the new album 15 seems to have changed: reviews are polarized, with consistent praise and direct rejection – some are delighted by his new breakthrough, his attempt to blend blues, rock, soul, and R&B; others are deeply disappointed, criticizing his vocal performance, the shallow lyrics, and the theme concept, etc. “With this album, both musically and in the stories and thoughts I want to share with you, it is a challenge for me, and also for the listeners,” Fang DaTong wrote in the album, and it seems that he has already foreseen the possible reactions of the listeners. At the beginning of this month, Fang Datong brought his fifth original album, 15, to the mainland for a tour promotion. Yesterday afternoon, he met with Nan Du journalists in Guangzhou and talked about the very unkind controversy caused by 15, and finally talked about his \"King of Bad Jokes\". Fang Datong said, \"The production of this album is the best, the new changes and new standards are better, but what I do is black music.\" Controversy 1 New Fad Tasting Response: This is what I want to do with the new rock album, which includes 11 songs, produced by Fang Datong, Edward Chan, and Charles Lee. Fang Datong is responsible for all the composition and arrangement of the album, and also wrote more than half of the lyrics. The album largely continues its previous positive and fresh song attitude, and even the song \"No Mushrooms Friends\" that advises young people not to take drugs has a fresh and elegant melody. Nevertheless, Fang Datong’s attitude of seeking change in music can also be seen in this album. For example, in terms of performance, it is no longer \"one person\\'s madness\", but a band composed of two new partners, Chen Zhaogui and Li Yiding; in terms of arrangement, the retro guitar sound effect, the long horn group, the solo section, and the singing style of the old spiritual song are all very fresh to the fans. Some people are happy about this change, but others think that all changes are just \"a taste\" and that Fang Datong\\'s singing style is not well expressed in Bandsound, and that the rock music is not done thoroughly enough. In response to these doubts, Fang Datong replied, \"Although they are all black music, R&B is more gentle and soft, while the blues has more attitude and a bit more play with sound.\" It is easy to make the singing part cover the band, as long as I turn it up when mixing. Some people think that rock music should always have the vocals overpower all the instruments, but I don\\'t think that\\'s necessary. I think it\\'s important to not only hear the human voice, but also the arrangement. Fang Datong said that the rock music he likes is the kind of urban soul music like Jimi Hendrix and The White Stripes. Some people may think that the rock music I have done is not thorough enough, but he only understands a part of rock music. Controversy 2 lyrics are simple and thin response: I don\\'t need to be so direct. Fang Datong, who has always been committed to creation, has invested more energy in the lyrics this time. 11 songs have 8 lyrics with his participation, but the quality has received much criticism. Some music critics believe that Fang DaTong\\'s music is like missing a thread without Zhou YaoHui\\'s support. Many music fans also think that the lyrics are too simple, which makes the content too thin and weakens the atmosphere of the song. Even fans misunderstood the meaning of the lyrics. The fresh and elegant \"No Mushrooms\" was originally a \"anti-drug\" theme, which made many people stunned. The Southern Metropolis Daily reporter threw this question to Fang Datong, who laughed and said, \"I don\\'t need to be that direct and violent.\" I don\\'t understand some English lyrics, I have to study them slowly. Some songs can only be fully understood if the lyricist sits down and talks to you. For example, in \"My Red Carpet,\" the line \"I walked over the red carpet,\" which means that the police had arrived and the carpet was all blood, and someone had died on the sofa, according to the news report that inspired me. Fang Datong explained, \"I usually write lyrics, but this time I wrote more because many of the songs were not suitable for the people who had written lyrics for me before.\" This time, the style is blues rock, and the sentence structure and the singing style actually do not suit the general Chinese lyrics writing method too much. Album Name Analysis 15, Fang Datong named the album \"15\" because it is the age when he started to learn the guitar, and it also means that he will return to guitar-related content this time. In terms of music style, he will use blues and rock to decorate soul and R&B, and make an \"UrbanBlues/Rock\" (i.e. urban blues/rock). He introduced that this attempt was inspired by John Mayer (John. Inspired by Mel (Contin-uum) and blues guitarists Eric Clapton (埃里克·帕特里克·克莱普顿), Jimi Hendrix (吉米·亨德里克斯), B.B. King, etc. With more life experiences, he also touched on environmental protection, anti-drug, love and marriage in his songs. Off the record, Fang Datong talks about his \"boring\" jokes. Fang Datong always gives people the impression of being \"gentle and serious\": he always goes to the same restaurant and orders the same dishes; his voice is not too loud, and his speaking speed is not too fast, he is gentle and courteous; he has few rumors, often sings about love, but has been in a loveless period for six years. The album 15 is not an exception to have several love songs, such as Zhang Yongcheng, which was inspired by the movie Ip Man 2 and describes Ip Man’s desire to go home to see his wife and children, and Qingsheng Strategy, which criticizes young people today who treat love as a game, and Errenyou, which tells a story of a third man who says no to a man. When it comes to the topic of love, Fang Daotong said that his ideal partner has not yet appeared, but he hopes to get married before the age of 35. Fang Datong says that he is a slow starter. \"I like to observe and listen, but I am also quite talkative among friends.\" The reporter asked Fang Datong to tell a cold joke, saying that he was afraid that it would leave a bad impression on him. Then he still contributed two small jokes: \"When others ask me why I don\\'t plan to get married and don\\'t have a girlfriend, I say it\\'s up to fate, and I\\'m too busy with work and recording.\" He doesn\\'t believe me, I said you should check my Weibo, because I need to mix, so there is no marriage. \"I have a hairdresser named Carl. When others ask where he is, I say he is in the parking lot.\" \"(Carl and car - the pronunciation is similar)\"']\n"

      "['', '正向', \"Summary: Commodity Futures Market Bullish, Vegetable Oil Prices Hit New Highs Sina Finance News - Thursday, China's domestic commodity futures market saw a full market rise, with vegetable oil varieties collectively strengthening, with rapeseed oil, palm oil, and rapeseed oil all hitting new highs in the middle of the day. Rubber and cotton also saw significant gains, while chemical products and agricultural products mostly saw small increases. Today, the position of soybean oil in the oil category has increased to 09. The resistance level is at 10800 and 11000. It is expected to continue the upward trend in the near term. It is recommended to hold long positions. There are signs of the Bollinger Bands of US soybeans expanding upwards, and US soybeans may test $14 this week. US economic data was positive yesterday, leading to a significant rebound in the US dollar and a rise in commodities, with soybeans also rebounding to $13.9. Argentina's weather will return to drought this weekend, providing support for the soybean outlook. Tonight, the USDA will release the export sales report. If the sales data is good, soybeans will continue to rise. Due to the ratio of soybeans to other US crops still being below the average, the market is expected to rise in the future, and long positions should be held. Meanwhile, the demand for oilseeds, the fastest-growing and most difficult-to-cultivate agricultural products in the US, supports the price of US soybeans. The decline in palm oil production will lead to a decrease in inventory, which will provide strong support for vegetable oils. Domestic oils were influenced by the rebound of US soybeans and hit a new high today. The open interest increased, and the market is expected to continue to rise, but there is a short-term risk of fluctuation. It is recommended that investors maintain the bullish strategy and courageously increase their positions at lower levels. On January 12, the USDA will release the US crop supply and demand report, which may accelerate the rise in vegetable oil prices. In terms of rubber technology, the Lu rubber 1105 contract opened above the previous high on Thursday, and the intraday price fell to the closing price of the previous trading day, which was supported and rose. From the chart pattern, the moving average is in a bullish arrangement, and the upward trend is good. Based on the indicators, the MA, MACD, and KDJ all show a golden cross, indicating a good entry point. But currently, rubber in Shanghai is at a relatively high level from the early stage, facing significant pressure, and it is advisable to be cautious when chasing high prices. Overall, the fundamentals of Shanghai rubber still provide support. From a technical perspective, the moving averages are in a bullish arrangement, the upward trend line is intact, and it is only a matter of time before Shanghai rubber breaks through the previous high. It is recommended to continue holding the long positions in the early stage. [Full text] Today, the Shanghai copper price fluctuated at a high level, opened and rose to a high, then fluctuated and fell back, but still closed up. Boosted by the bottom rebound of the foreign market, the main contract Cu1104 opened at 72010 with a gap up, and reached a high of 72490 during the session. However, affected by the weak performance of the domestic stock market, the copper price fluctuated and fell back, closing at 72020 yuan, up 740 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Today's turnover shrank, with about 191,000 contracts traded, and the total position decreased by 8,414 to 338,696 contracts. Today's copper price has stopped falling and rebounded, and the price has re-stationed above the 5-day moving average, temporarily halting the short-term adjustment. However, today's price rebound is clearly lacking in the cooperation of volume and position, and there is still a certain fear of high prices in the market. Reduce positions at high levels as the main strategy. Currently, domestic spot copper consumption is suppressed by high prices and does not show the pre-festival stockpiling demand in the peak season, with spot premiums maintained at 200-350 yuan, which to some extent suppresses the market's bullish sentiment. Copper prices will continue to maintain an external strong and internal weak pattern, passively following the upward trend of the foreign market. It is expected that in the near future, the Shanghai copper will mainly oscillate at a high level, and it is advisable to be cautious with long positions. [Full text] Corn prices in the domestic market of corn today fell after a rise, despite the significant rise in the bean market, it could not effectively drive the corn futures price. Under the stable supply of corn spot, most of the funds have switched to other varieties with larger fluctuations. Currently, the corn on the ground price in Dalian Port is 2060-2070 yuan per ton, with 14% moisture. The price of new corn from Heilongjiang Port is around 2020 yuan per ton. The corn on the ground price in Jinzhou Port is around 2070 yuan per ton. The market transactions are still relatively weak. New corn of better quality in the Guangdong port is quoted at 2160-2180 yuan per ton, while old corn is quoted at 2180-2200 yuan per ton. The port's corn of better quality is sold quickly, and the port's corn inventory is about 230,000 tons. Recently, the prices of starch and corn oil in China have been continuously falling. The downstream demand is not strong and does not support the rise in corn prices for the time being. Under the situation of declining profits, there is a possibility of a slight adjustment in the acquisition price of deep processing enterprises. In addition, the Spring Festival is approaching, and farmers usually have a peak period of selling grain before the Spring Festival, which will increase the supply of corn. However, the main force in the early corn market acquisition was deep processing and centrally-owned enterprises, and ordinary traders have never had competitiveness. Under the circumstances of declining profits of deep processing and restrictions on centrally-owned enterprises, traders may seize this opportunity to sell grain to replenish their inventory, which will limit the downward space of corn. Overall, the corn market is still expected to maintain a range consolidation pattern, with the oscillation range of 2310-2360. Investors can conduct band trading, with the range ends as stop-loss. Crude oil saw market sentiment lifted on Wednesday after the US private employment data for December came in unexpectedly strong. Human resources service company AutomaticDataProcessingInc. The ADP and the employment report released by the consulting firm Macroeconomic Advisers show that the number of private sector jobs in the US increased by 297,000 in December. Economists had expected ADP to announce an increase of 100,000 jobs in December. The weekly inventory report released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 4.16 million barrels to 335.27 million barrels for the week ending December 31, compared to the expected decrease of 1.8 million barrels. On Wednesday, the number of private sector jobs released by the United States was better than expected, and the decline in crude oil inventories released by EIA also exceeded market expectations. The above fundamental factors offset the negative impact of the dollar's rise, which boosted the price of crude oil and recovered the 90-dollar level. In terms of Shanghai oil, due to weak demand in recent days, the price has been oscillating at a low level, but there is some support around 4900, and long positions established here can be held. [Full text] Early rice, from the recent spot market performance, the acquisition price of japonica rice in the north and North China region is steadily rising, the acquisition price of late rice in the Jiangnan region is relatively stable with a slight increase, at present, the early rice market is in a period of lightness, the trading volume in the market is insufficient. With the arrival of the peak consumption period of the Spring Festival, the market price of rice is expected to rise further. The overall upward trend of the international agricultural product market is intact, and the grain market has found new topics to support, which is expected to further increase the CBOT agricultural product futures price. Domestic grain markets have also been boosted, but early rice, constrained by policy pressure, is still rising slowly. But overall, it will still maintain an upward trend with fluctuations. The performance during the session shows that the early rice market in the near term needs to be supported by the surrounding atmosphere. With insufficient attention from funds due to the lack of effective support, it is recommended to be more observant and less active in operations, or to lay out phased long positions at low levels. [Full text] The gold price was boosted by the better-than-expected ISM non-manufacturing index and ADP employment data released by the United States, which led to a sharp rise in the US dollar index. The US non-farm employment report for December will be released this Friday, which may provide further guidance for gold. Recalling that on December 3 last year, when the US unemployment rate in November was as high as 9.8%, far worse than expected, gold rose by 28 dollars on that day, but a series of recent data have shown that the US economy has shown some signs of recovery, so the non-farm employment report to be released tomorrow is crucial. In the short term, gold may have some technical rebounds after a sharp decline, but constrained by the strong US dollar index, the rebound is expected to be limited, with the upper pressure level at 1390 US dollars and the lower support level at 1365 US dollars.

Xi Wei said that at present, the whole society has formed a wave of cleaning up and rectifying the lowbrow trend on the Internet, and the powerful public opinion pressure has strengthened the self-discipline awareness of the websites. Some websites, which have accumulated a large number of bad and illegal information in their columns and channels for years, have been difficult to clean up thoroughly in a short time, thus affecting the intensity and speed of the rectification. However, their attitudes have been very positive, and they have cooperated with the accountability calls from the reporting center. Some unexposed websites proactively contacted the reporting center to ask whether there were any problems with their websites, what aspects of the problems were, and some websites proactively closed the columns that were prone to problems, waited until they were cleaned up by themselves, and then opened them, and communicated with the reporting center in a timely manner to listen to the opinions and suggestions of the reporting center.']\n"

      "['顾云昌,范越,蔡,蔡总,陈,陈总,顾总,顾老,老虎伍兹,伍兹,姚明,范总,陈秘书长,陈志,顾老师,范秘书长', '正向', \"Yanxi Tai Xishan Golf Ridge Expert Appreciation Meeting (Photo Album) (2) Gu Yunchang, vice president of China Real Estate and Residential Research Association, spoke at the meeting [Fan Yue]: First of all, thank you for organizing this activity, Mr. Cai. I have been to Yanxi Tai twice before and have seen the environment here. I am very familiar with this place. Originally, climbing Xiangshan and going to the Summer Palace were spring outings organized by my school when I was in elementary school, and I felt it was unique. I have been playing golf for 18 years, and now there are nearly 80,000 people playing golf in Beijing. The increase in the number of people playing golf and our friend Chen, General Manager, I think the development of China's economy has indeed brought a very fast opportunity to improve people's living standards. And the development of real estate that General Manager Gu just mentioned. [Fanyue]: As for this, it should be unique in Beijing. Although it is now a 9-hole golf course, it has already formed a combination of real estate, villas, and golf with the community. This combination, as Old Gu just said, is basically the hardware in the international market. However, from the software perspective, in terms of golf culture, villas, communities, and even living environment, as we were chatting, Mr. Chen also said that many people like mountain climbing, and I also know many old comrades who like mountain climbing. Everyone believes that intense exercise is a good exercise. In fact, golf can be recommended as a sport for people in their thirties, forties, or even higher. You can start from the age of five and continue to the age of ninety-five. The span is very large. [Fanyue] : Such a nice villa, two people living in it should still be very wasteful. A good community should be that the elderly, children, and preferably three generations enjoy the life of the villa. In fact, why is golf not understood very much in China, while it is a very mature and excellent sports industry abroad, especially in this era, Tiger Woods, such a good player, has promoted this industry. My biggest takeaway from going abroad is that after painting, you can go play, and ordinary workers can go play. If a family lives here, the children, even the grandfathers and grandsons can enjoy this life, play together, and this is very common in foreign countries. A family of three, when I was playing basketball in the United States, I met a father and daughter and son-in-law. I talked to them, and he said that our family lives here, and we can play basketball right outside the door. The community's basketball court has a good thing, and we also put forward a suggestion, like Mr. Chen, to integrate the property management fee, so that playing basketball doesn't cost any money. [Fanyue] : I visited a senior community in Los Angeles, and this is still a high-quality golf course. Their golf course is shorter than this, about 5,000 yards. For the elderly, the short clubs are very short. Such communities do not exist in Beijing because you can see the mountains when you look up, and you can climb mountains if you want to climb mountains, and you can play golf if you want to play golf. This culture of golf has permeated because where is the concept of enjoying life through golf? The biggest concept is to adjust your mindset to enjoy life, rather than relying entirely on competition and confrontation, because many people need to relax after a lot of mental labor every day. The best way to relax with golf is to adjust your body and mind, and now many retired leaders have started to enjoy the joy of golf. [Fanyue]: Last month, I experienced in Japan that there are now about 60 to 70 elderly people playing golf and having dinner together in the evening, enjoying this life. In China, we still can't see this scene, but I think that for Mr. Chen and me, in 20 years, we will be able to enjoy the life of golf, enjoy this excellent community, property, and the combination of golf. I think this is a trend, but this location is no longer available in Beijing. If this location were in Shanghai, it would be amazing, because Beijing is still much cheaper than Shanghai. From an international perspective, I also support Mr. Cai. We held these forums last year, especially in Fangshan and the western part. We saw that the living standards cannot be reduced, only encountering some crises in the short term, just like people encountering some physical discomfort, etc. But no matter what, the community is moving forward, the living standards are constantly improving, and this foresight and predictability, as investors and real estate developers, we still need to look at the development of real estate from a high point. [Fanyue]: Why do I talk about golf culture? We also had an effect during the SARS period. When the people in the back group of Guangdong hit the people in front, many people wanted to hit. If I think that Mr. Chen and Mr. Cai are neighbors, one sentence will not cause more jokes. In China, golf has a good community platform, and everyone does not know each other in the building, which is also a very awkward life state. It is very friendly and friendly abroad because of the specifications of golf, etiquette and politeness. The higher realm is to think for others. Therefore, I think that from the perspective of culture and spirit, there are still many things to promote about golf. It is not easy for children who play golf to go bad. There is a realm and pursuit goal in playing golf. Many people put more energy on playing golf. Tiger Woods also gave a free golf academy to the United States. Including China, there is a basketball Yao Ming like NBA. More people like NBA, although Yanxitai is low-key, but it has also gradually seen the green name, which is quite distinctive. So I hope that our community will be better and better, and provide a good platform and exchange opportunities for Beijing's golf culture and residential culture. [Host]: Thank you, Mr. Fan. I also gave you an opinion just now. It's not good to be too low-key. If I had known about this project earlier, I would have considered it when I was buying a house. I really didn't know before. Today is the first time I've come to the project site. You play ball and know the information about the golf course faster than us. If we had started two years ago, we would have thought about what the price would be. But with the information about the golf course, we wouldn't have lost the opportunity to buy a house. [Host]: What you just said about the development trends abroad, like the developed countries in Europe and America, their today is our future. In a few years, we will even surpass them in many aspects. Yesterday at noon, I talked to a friend who used to work in the government and is now in finance. During the whole process, we only listened to him talk. He is now encouraging people around him to buy good properties, such as houses in good locations for education, sports fields, and hospitals, because from the overall economic situation, it is still deflation now. But from the global economic situation and the measures taken by the government to save the market, it is certain that the second half of the year will enter the inflation period. The overall price index, what is the most secure, the investment in real estate from the current market, we have already seen that a large number of investors have already entered the market. In our private conversation, he said that we must hold good resources of property. In the next one or two years, he predicts that the inflation will reach double digits by the end of this year, and I think the government also needs to take a comprehensive consideration. From the reform and opening up to the present, it is often a problem of the situation at both ends. In the past, we lacked a lot of experience and means, especially in the development of the real estate market. When we talked to Secretary-General Chen, we were always worried that we needed to rescue the market, but we couldn't go too far, leading to a sharp rise in housing prices. This is what the government is worried about, but the overall situation is here. It's not just China that is rescuing the market, but Europe and America are also rescuing the market. The United States is printing a large amount of money, and the impact on government consumption stimulation and promotion is still very high. Many people expect that by the second half of next year, there will be a very obvious manifestation. At this time, I think that from the perspective of people's property investment, financial management is also something that needs to be closely watched. This is the vice secretary of the Beijing Real Estate Association, Chen Zhi [host]: Secretary Chen, you are very familiar with the market in Beijing, and I also hope that you can talk about your views on this aspect. [Chen Zhi]: Just talk casually, because Teacher Gu is here, he is a senior in golf, I have never played golf, I play football, now many of my friends have been pulled into golf, football is a sport for young people. Today I am very happy to come to Yanxitai project, and the environment is very good when I take a look. As Mr. Cai also mentioned just now, Mr. Gu also talked about the situation of real estate, which actually involves a credit issue. Yesterday afternoon, I communicated with the Beijing Banking Association, and we also talked about the credit issues. From the whole country, the credit scale of 4.58 trillion yuan in the first quarter is quite scary. The annual target is 5 trillion yuan. It is only the first quarter, and we feel that in order to save the market, the credit scale has rapidly expanded in the first quarter. As Mr. Cai said just now, we are worried that so much money will be poured in, and whether it will quickly cause large-scale inflation, even uncontrollable. When I talked to the comrades of the banking association, I got a piece of information. Now more than 60% of the scale is still in the bill market, and has not entered the real economy. But with so much money, how to use it in the real economy, how to use it in the real economy, we are thinking about it. In the second half of this year, we will launch a system that can truly objectively evaluate the credit of real estate enterprises for banks and financial institutions. This is what we talked about yesterday with the banking association, and we reached a preliminary agreement. This is something we will do in the second half of the year, which can truly evaluate real estate enterprises and banks through evaluation, and make banks more aware of the value of our enterprises. [Chen Zhi]: When it comes to investment, Gu teacher mentioned a basic concept just now, that is, after fifty or sixty years, the life cycle of the house has ended, but its economic cycle has not yet ended. The land is constantly increasing in value. From the perspective of investment, I think more attention should be paid to scarce resources, especially the resources of scarce locations. Beijing is an international metropolis, the center of politics, economy, and culture. In particular, this city where the headquarters economy converges is a very special one, and it has a very obvious window effect and demonstration effect. This is an irreplaceable resource in all the cities in China. In such a city, we still have such a good project, occupying such a large amount of scarce resources. As we said, the properties on the subway, the urban trunk line, as long as the subway is connected, the price will rise. From this perspective, we can see that the Yanxi Terrace project, from the perspective of investment, I personally think there is no problem. It should be that with the development of the economy, with the promotion of internationalization and urbanization, such resources will be less and less. As a scarce resource, Secretary-General Fan said just now, including education, the cultivation of people's character, etc., all have many effects, and it is also a kind of pull on the economy. So I think such a project, it is impossible to be too much, because it is scarce, it is impossible to be too much. I think it should be a product worth treasuring.\"]\n"

Sina Sports News  On October 23, according to nj.com, before the game between the Nets and Knicks on Tuesday, coach Lawrence Frank asked Sean Williams whether he should start, and the result was that Williams actually firmly refused Frank\\'s kindness. Frank did not look at Williams with a look of amazement as if he were an alien or a fool, questioning his ambition. The Nets coach just shrugged and smiled, because he knew Williams too well. \"He is extremely sincere in giving up the starting position,\" Frank said. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s weird. He is just like that.\" Shien is a team player, he is not a selfish guy, he is very kind-hearted, and he really feels that it is appropriate to give Brook a starting opportunity. But Frank\\'s defense still couldn\\'t cover up the real problem, did Williams really have the heart to compete for the starting center position? If he did, why did he retreat at a time when he needed more playing time to prove himself with better data? Williams, who is the main center of the Nets, has already fallen behind Lopez and Josh Boone. What kind of mentality is it if he doesn\\'t rise up and learn to be Lei Feng? Wasn\\'t Williams supposed to be the Nets\\' No. 1 player in training camp for the first two weeks? \"Bro, I know what I can do,\" Williams said. \"Everyone on the team knows my ability, now it\\'s training camp time, and the coach is just doing what he has to do to get everyone ready for the new season.\" All I can do is work hard every day to prepare for the opportunity of the new season, do you understand? Williams played for only 89 minutes in the five pre-season matches, while Lopez played for 139 minutes. In fact, Williams did not fully demonstrate his ability. He was still full of energy, but this did not translate into tangible data or influence on the game. \"Oh, I am actually regressing a little,\" Williams said. \"I just try to get back on track and run to the right position on the court and do the right things to improve myself further.\" I have a lot of confidence in my own abilities. This is just the pre-season, and these games don\\'t count. I just want to fully enjoy the fun of playing and find the feeling of teamwork. The whole team is working hard to get better, and now there are a lot of injured players, and many new players have joined, it\\'s just the stage of cultivating team chemistry, do you understand what I mean? Williams’ new season outlook is becoming increasingly unclear, as he has not received many opportunities to play as a power forward, which has affected his playing time. And Williams is average offensively and needs work in the low post. But what Frank was worried about was not Williams\\' data, but that his performance was not yet stable enough. \"Sean must be the kind of player who can change the course of a game, a dynamic player who runs the floor, looking for easy baskets, grabbing offensive rebounds to protect the paint,\" the coach said. \"These things must now be his signature and hallmark in the league.\" (Camus)']\n"

It will not be long before the dust settles, Peng Yang, an intern reporter of Financial Weekly, writes. 1+1<1 When will this situation occur? It often happens in Shanghai. The most typical case is that Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China, was put into use in 2000, which gave Shanghai an \"one city, two airports\" model similar to Incheon and Kimpo airports in South Korea\\'s Seoul and Narita and Haneda airports in Tokyo, Japan. However, in the past 9 years, the market share of the two airports in the Yangtze River Delta has actually declined from 78% to 70%. And if the much-anticipated expansion of Hongqiao airport is completed by the end of 2009 and opens for trial operation in March 2010, the weak appeal of Shanghai airport’s listed assets at Pudong airport will be further diminished. So, will Shanghai Airport (600009.SH) inject it into the Shanghai airport before the expansion of Hongqiao Airport is completed, so as to achieve a full listing? It is believed that the dust will soon settle. \"Asset injection catalysts are approaching\" with market rumors intensifying recently. And the securities firms began to write intensive reports recommending Shanghai Airport, as Sunyuan said, \"Shanghai Airport has entered a period of rapid growth, and its long-term hub status has been strengthened. Phase II of Hongqiao will be put into operation in March next year, and at the same time, it will face business diversion and competition from peers. The catalyst for asset injection is approaching, and the rating has been upgraded to buy.\" UBS Securities analyst Wei Qiang believes that the assets of Hongqiao Airport are likely to be injected into Shanghai Airport before March 2010. As early as the shareholders\\' meeting of Shanghai Airport on June 26, Yu Wuyan, the chairman of Shanghai Airport, made an urgent statement, \"The integration of Pudong Airport and Hongqiao Airport is inevitable, but there is no specific timetable at present.\" The journalist contacted the office staff of Shanghai Airport, and the reply was that \"the company is currently studying specific integration plans, and there is no specific timetable.\" The internal integration of the two airports is basically in place, and the key at present is to wait for the government to make a decision. According to a securities analyst close to Shanghai airport, the two airports had already prepared for the overall listing of the Shanghai airport group when they reached an agreement on asset swap in 2003. Shanghai Airport Group General Manager Jia Ruijun expressed the logic of the above analyst as early as after the expansion plan of Hongqiao Airport was approved in 2007. It seems that the management is strongly motivated to push for a full listing of the Shanghai airport. The expansion project of Phase II of Hongqiao has now completed the topping out of the terminal building structure and will be put into use in March 2010. The securities analysts believe that before the completion of Phase II of Hongqiao Airport before March next year, the assets of Hongqiao Airport are likely to be injected into Shanghai Airport, and will not violate the original commitment of asset injection and share reform. Shenwan\\'s latest research report said that Shanghai Airport may take over Phase II of Hongqiao in two ways: one is to inject it into the listed company together with Hongqiao Phase I and other mature assets; the other is for the listed company to lease and use the assets of Phase II of Hongqiao, and to acquire them from the group in the future through financing. \"25% increase in 2009 performance\", domestic passenger traffic entering a period of rapid growth, international passenger traffic will resume positive growth, the successful reorganization of Air China and Shanghai Airlines, and the approach of the Expo, all undoubtedly injected a catalyst into the integration plan of Shanghai Airport. In 2008, the number of international and regional passengers at the two airports in Shanghai reached 164.8 million, which was clearly higher than that at the Capital Airport and Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou. In addition, the 2010 World Expo will bring an additional 6.2 million passengers to Shanghai, representing a 12% increase in passenger throughput. Currently, the revenue of Shanghai Airport mainly comes from aviation income, including landing and take-off fees, passenger transit service fees, and ground service income, and non-aviation income only accounts for 30%, and non-aviation development is not sufficient. With the implementation of the commercial development plan of Pudong Airport, there is a great potential for development in non-airport revenue areas in the future. According to Shenwan, the injection of mature assets such as Phase I of Hongqiao and cargo station will increase the 2009 performance by 25%, and the 2010 performance by 10%-15%. The Hongqiao Phase II, which may be operated through one-time injection or leasing, with a capital expenditure of 15 billion, may have a negative impact on the short-term performance of Shanghai Airport. Above, the UBS analyst believes that \"rational coordination by the management of the two major airports in Shanghai will be beneficial to small shareholders.\"']\n"

Now, he should have returned to Portugal and joined the team for a series of preparations and matches in another place. However, Wang Gang, who was determined to wear the national team jersey, suffered an injury in the summer match, which not only made him basically unable to participate in the pre-season training camp of Belenam, but also Portuguese media said that this might affect his final signing of the new season's work contract with Belenam. Although Wang Gang's injuries were not serious after the MRI check, he still chose to be alone in the days before returning to Portugal, as his mood was not good. On the 20th, it was the day Wang Gang said he would return to Aveiro, Portugal. But according to his agent, he did not join Belenam directly, but will recover alone in Aveiro, which means that Wang Gang is likely to miss the entire pre-season preparation for the Portuguese Super League. However, the agent later gave a somewhat reassuring message, that Wang Gang's injury was not as serious as the Portuguese media reported, and would not affect his participation in the new season of the Primeira Liga. He revealed that Wang Gang will sign a new season's work contract with the team after returning to Aveiro from Bella Maral's summer camp.

India, which borders China, is located in the South Asian subcontinent, with an area of about 2.98 million square kilometers and a population of 1.166 billion. The Indian economy is based on traditional farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, modern industry, and other supporting industries. In India, the communication market has great potential, and the openness of the market has also attracted many operators to participate, making competition increasingly fierce. Aircel is a controlling subsidiary of Maxis Group, a new mobile operator in Southeast Asia, and 74% of its shares are owned by Maxis. Currently, Aircel has 19.6 million users in India. As one of the leading mobile network service providers in India, Aircel has already covered 10 states in India. Currently, it plans to cover the whole of India.

Sina Sports News, among the 32 countries participating in the World Cup, Italy was the third to announce the list, the national team of 23 people, in the end, Xisigou, Kousu, Casani, Bolelo, G-Rossi became the last to be excluded. Although the previous Grosseto\\'s elimination caused quite a stir, at least the controversy was not very big, but this time the five eliminated candidates have attracted a lot of doubts. The most questioned omission was that of Borrelli, despite the explanation of the veteran Baggio, who said that \"Terry Pratchett wanted a substitute with similar characteristics to Gialiddo, so he chose Paolini and left Borrelli out.\" But former Inter Milan star Baccaroschi still feels sorry: \"I know that Prandelli prefers Gialiddino, but I still think that Borrelli had a great season.\" The problem is not whether Prandelli chose Pachini or Borrelli, but that Borrelli and Giuseppe Rossi are both talented players. After both of them were left out, first, Italy lost a powerful striker, and second, D\\'Inazio no longer had a substitute. In the attack, Italy only has Gialiddino, Pachini, Aquilanta, Dinatale, and Quagliarella, which is indeed a little thin. And among them, the Italian media had previously predicted that the striker who would be left out would definitely be Quagliarella, and Rossi and Boleslo would \"compete\" for a spot, but Liapi\\'s choice surprised everyone. From Liapi\\'s choice, he still hopes to play 4-3-3 as the main, compared with Rossi, Quagliarella is a true winger, but Liapi\\'s first choice must still be Aquilani and Dinatale, will Liapi really dare to use Quagliarella, who is in poor form, if one of the two is injured? If so, why did Liapi not select Balotelli, even if he deliberately excluded Cassano? Kossu\\'s defeat was expected by the media, but it was still a difficult matter. Once Italy needed to add a central midfielder, the only choice was Camoranesi. However, compared to Kossu, who scored 12 goals and had a long-range shot skill in the current season, Camoranesi, who had grown a little potbelly, was indeed too poor in form. Between experience and form, he chose the former. I wonder if Li Pei made the right choice. There are also some doubts about Cassani\\'s absence from the back line. Currently, Li Pi only has 7 defenders, including four center-backs, Cannavaro, Chiellini, Bonucci, and Bocchetti, and three wing-backs, Majo, Cristit, and Zambrotta. However, among the three wing-backs, Majo and Cristit play as wing-backs in the 3-5-2 and 3-4-3 formations in their respective clubs, which is quite different from the wing-backs in the 4-4-2 formation. Zambrotta\\'s position is still a substitute. Even if Li Pi moves Chiellini to the left, Chiellini still played as a left-back in the era when Capello coached Juventus, and his level as a left-back is much worse than that of a center-back. In this way, it not only weakens Chiellini, but also weakens the position of Italian center-backs. And the lack of a genuine full-back is likely to become an irreparable hole in Italy’s World Cup campaign. (Shen Fei)']\n"

Scoring and grabbing a rebound every two minutes, Sina Sports News, on October 29, Beijing time, the Chinese men\\'s national team defeated the American star team, the opponent, in Ningbo Beilun, and won the first victory in this series of warm-up matches. Tang Zhengdong performed excellently in this game, scoring 7 points and grabbing 7 rebounds in just 13 minutes of play. With 5 minutes left in the third quarter, ZHU Fangyu passed to TANG Zhengdong after drawing the defense to the top of the key. There was no defender by Tang Zhengdong at the moment. He hesitated for a moment and did not attack immediately. The American star team\\'s defenders quickly surrounded him, forming a three-man encirclement, and Tang Zhengdong turned and attacked strongly, causing the opponent to commit a foul. This offensive fully demonstrated Tang Zhengdong\\'s current condition. After being away from the court for a period of time due to injury, Tang Zhengdong\\'s feeling on the court has not yet reached the best state, and there is still some hesitation in his offensive and defensive choices in the game, and his speed is still a little slow. But against this American all-star team, Tang Zhengdong still had an absolute advantage in height and weight, and even when three people surrounded him, the opponent could only use fouls to block his attack. Height and weight advantages will still be maintained by Tang Zhengdong in the Asian arena, but he needs to quickly find the feel of the game and speed up his footwork. Although Tang Zhengdong\\'s condition was not at its best, it is certain that the current Tang Dynasty is working hard. With 3:42 left in the third quarter, Tang Zhengdong fell to the ground to save the ball during a rebound battle with the other team. It should be known that this was his second time falling to the ground to save the ball in this game. Such a scene has never been seen even when Tang Zhengdong was in good condition. How could it be now that his knee injury had not yet fully recovered. At least from this, we can see Tang Zhengdong\\'s attitude of effort. With the ball in hand, he went to the backcourt to attack. After grabbing the front court rebound, he launched a second attack. He passed the ball to his teammate, who made a good assist. Although his playing time was not too much, Tang Zhengdong had fully demonstrated his power in the frontcourt in this game. Compared with his peak performance, he can only be said to have recovered 50%. Even so, his efficiency is still less than one point and one rebound every two minutes on average. Su Qun, a famous commentator of CCTV, said about Tang Zhengdong\\'s performance: \"After being away from the court for such a long time, Tang Zhengdong has a 99% chance of participating in the Asian Games, especially when Su Wei cannot participate in the Asian Games due to injury, which is a very good opportunity for him.\" The last time Tang Zhengdong wore the national team\\'s uniform to compete on the international stage was back in the 2006 Doha Asian Games. But that experience was one that Tang Zhengdong would rather not recall. At that time, the national team coach was the stubborn Yujun, who only gave Tang Zhengdong one chance to play and then completely sat him on the bench. Since then, Tang Zhengdong has completely fallen into a low point, and he has been plagued by injuries in the league. He always misses the national team training. Now, after recovering from injury, Tang Zhengdong finally has the opportunity to prove himself on the Asian Games stage, while Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian are unable to participate due to their NBA commitments, and Su Wei is also unable to play due to injury. This might be a turning point in Zhang Zhen Dong\\'s career. (Baby doll)']\n"

Sina Sports News 0-3, this is the result of the national team and the Korean team before the match, no one expected. Three days ago, this Korean team lost to Hong Kong by a score of 1-4. In the face of such an outcome, the Chinese Olympic team collectively fell silent after the game, and the coaching staff did not go downstairs for dinner. Many domestic reporters came to interview this game because everyone was looking forward to the record of Chinese football breaking the 20 years of not winning against South Korea. But in the end, everyone witnessed the shame of Chinese football once again. After the match, the head coach Liu Chunming patiently received the interview from everyone at the press conference. Because there were so many reporters asking questions, when the reporters rushed to the mixed interview area after the press conference ended, they found that there was no one there. Just as we thought that Guo Ao had already left, the volunteers told us that the Guo Ao team had not yet come out. It was not until nearly ten minutes after the press conference ended that the members of the Olympic team came out of the passage of the rest room in silence. The substitutes, such as Yu Yang, who did not participate in the game, led the way. After the main players walked out, they hurriedly left the waiting reporters at the mixed zone. Even if one or two of them were pulled back, they pleaded with a sad voice: Brother, don\\'t interview, there\\'s nothing to say, and they are not allowed to say anything. Who is it that doesn\\'t want to say, or is it an excuse? The reporters waiting in the mixed zone then held back two players, who gave a consistent answer: the team really doesn\\'t allow them to talk. In fact, the Olympic team had already refused a media interview during the field training session right before the match. Even in front of the CCTV lens, the Olympic team refused the pre-game interview on the grounds that the delegation had a unified regulation and could only be interviewed in the press conference and the mixed zone. But after the game, in the mixed zone, there was even a voice that did not want to be interviewed. After the players said this, they rushed to the bus, and in the end, the team leader Li Xiaoguang came out of the rest room. When the reporters asked if they were not allowed to be interviewed, Li Xiaoguang was puzzled: No, there was no such thing. Then, four more media outlets came to the hotel where the Olympic team was staying. The Under-23 team had dinner at 10:30 p.m., and when it was time to eat, the players still walked into the dining hall with a disappointed expression. He would only stop occasionally to chat in a low voice with familiar journalists. In the end, the reporters could only go upstairs to ask what was going on. After team leader Li Xiaoguang understood the whole process, he explained: \"The delegation did have a rule before, which was that they could only be interviewed at the press conference and the mixed interview area, so they did not accept interviews before the competition according to the rule.\" But today it was definitely not that the players were not allowed to speak; it was that the players were in a bad mood. After all, they lost the game and by a large margin, so it’s understandable that the children are sad. But the next one will definitely arrange for the players to cooperate with the interview, even if they lose again, and even if the players are in a bad mood, I will still call them down from the bus. The players had no mood for an interview, and the coaching staff had no mood for eating. The coaches did not leave their rooms until the players had finished their dinner, and it seemed that this night would be another sleepless one for the Olympic team.

After the \"May Day\" in 2011, Vice President Peng Liang of Kuba Network was a little \"fire\", this fire came from \"moving house\". In 2010, the staff of Kuba Network was only more than 200 people, and it has now exceeded 800 people. The old office was too small to accommodate so many people, so we had to move house again and again. Peng Liang said, \"The staff are still expanding. The most urgent problem at the moment is to rent a house as soon as possible, otherwise the office will not be enough again.\" Not long ago, Peng Liang leased half a floor of the Ruida Building, and the office area of Kuba Network in Beijing increased by more than 1,000 square meters on the basis of 3,000 square meters, and the office area of Kuba Network across the country exceeded 10,000 square meters. The number of staff increased three times in five months. Peng Liang told the Electric Appliances reporter with no lack of pride that the growth of the number of staff was proportional to the growth of the sales on the website. In 2010, the sales of Kuba Network were 500 million yuan, and it will be between 1.5 and 2 billion yuan in 2011. During the May Day promotion this year, Kuba.com achieved sales of more than 100 million yuan. The market has developed rapidly, and it has achieved a sales scale of 100 million yuan in just a few days. This was unimaginable for most home appliance e-commerce platforms last year. In 2010, there were only a few websites in the home appliance e-commerce channel that exceeded 100 million yuan in annual sales. According to AVC data, in 2010, the scale of home appliance online shopping in China was 8 billion yuan, accounting for less than 2% of the overall scale of the home appliance market. Among the 8 billion yuan in sales, JD.com and Suning.com ranked first and second with more than 2 billion yuan, Kuba reached 500 million yuan, and Xin Qitian Electrical Network reached 550 million yuan. Taobao Electrical City and Newegg both exceeded 100 million yuan. Industry insiders said that compared with 2010, in 2011, all traditional channels will focus on the network platform, and the home appliance online market will show explosive growth. On February 23, 2011, Suning电器 released the overall development plan for 2011 with e-commerce development as the focus, announcing the establishment of a separate operating company - Suning Ebuy, parallel to the physical chain retail business, aiming to achieve a fourfold increase in sales and reach 8 billion yuan, and to achieve a sales revenue of 10 billion yuan in the near future. In April, the newly revised Gome online mall (www.gome.com.cn) was officially launched. Gome plans that in the next 2-3 years, its online mall will account for more than 10% of its sales, and will occupy more than 15% of the capacity of China\\'s home appliance online market. Zuo Yingjie, the president of Xin Qitian Electric Appliances Network, believes that in 2011, JD Mall and Taobao Electrical City are expected to achieve a home appliance sales scale of 4 billion yuan, and Kuba and Gome Online Mall will reach 4 billion yuan in total, and Xin Qitian will achieve 500 million to 800 million yuan. If Suning can achieve a sales scale of 10 billion yuan, the scale of home appliance online sales in China in 2011 will be nearly twice that of 2010. AVC predicts that home appliance online shopping will maintain rapid growth in the next few years, and it is expected to exceed 100 billion yuan in 2015, accounting for 14% of the overall scale of the home appliance market, and becoming the third largest channel model in the home appliance market. Currently, the main competitors in the home appliance network channel in China have formed three categories of platforms, namely, third-party B2C home appliance network platforms represented by JD Mall and Taobao Home Appliances, traditional chain channel network platforms represented by Gome and Suning, and enterprise self-built network platforms represented by various brand owners. In terms of sales scale, JD Mall, Gome Appliances (including Gome Online Mall and Kuba), Suning.com, Taobao Appliances City, and Xin Qiqi Appliances Network have already established their industry status. Industry insiders say that third-party B2C home appliance network platforms and traditional chain channel network platforms are the main force in the development of network channels, and enterprise self-built websites have a smaller sales scale than the other two channels due to their single product and lack of price advantage. In 2011, the sales performance of home appliance enterprises\\' self-built network platforms also grew, but the increase was smaller compared to the other two major platforms. As a self-built website of the enterprise, Hisense Online Mall has been online for exactly one year from May 2010 to now. Chao Hongzhai, the general manager of Hisense Kelon\\'s e-commerce department, said, \"So far, the sales of Hisense\\'s online mall have exceeded the task volume set by the company at the beginning of the online launch. However, the development of China\\'s home appliance online shopping market is so rapid that the growth of our sales scale has not reached our psychological expectations.\" Meanwhile, Zhuo Hongzhai said that although Hisense had its own online mall, more than 70% of its online sales still came from third-party B2C home appliance online shopping platforms. Some companies are getting ready to build their own online shopping malls. Liu Chunhua, the executive vice president of Shuangang Group, told the Electrical Appliances that the network channel is the future direction of home appliance sales. Two years ago, ShuKang established its first online marketing department, which was the first online marketing department in the domestic kitchen appliance industry. Currently, the sales performance of Super King on third-party B2C home appliance network platforms accounts for 5% to 8% of the company\\'s total sales. We are planning to launch our own online mall at the beginning of next year. This mall is not only a sales platform, but also an information exchange platform, a brand display platform, and a user interaction platform. We will build a forum on it, and we will also interact with users through Weibo. We took three years to set up the online mall, also considering that the Internet is a double-edged sword, which can infinitely magnify both the advantages and disadvantages of a company. The Ouxi online mall is also under construction. According to the relevant person in charge of Ouxi, Ouxi realized the strategic significance of competing for the network battlefield three years ago, and began to cooperate with Taobao in September 2009. The main function of the online mall is to provide enterprises with the opportunity to promote their products and services, to bring enterprises and customers closer, and to facilitate communication between enterprises and consumers. Compared with 2010, the sales of Oux in third-party websites in 2011 exceeded the expected growth, and Oux is expanding the manpower of the online shopping department to cope with the rapidly growing business volume. Such rapid growth is related to the product layout of Ouxi. The products sold online by Ouxi are different from those sold offline. The online products are mainly network exclusive models, with regular models as supplements. Win-win new model emerges with the growth of the market. In 2011, some new models of home appliance online marketing appeared. Until 2010, the three types of network channel platforms operated independently. With Gome\\'s acquisition of Kuba Network on November 22, 2010, third-party home appliance online platforms began their first cooperation with traditional chain channels, creating a new model for online channels. After the launch of the new Gome online mall, Gome\\'s president, Wang Junzhou, said that Gome would participate in the competition of e-commerce by adopting a dual brand strategy, \"the two e-commerce platforms will share Gome\\'s logistics, procurement, service and human resources.\" Some industry insiders expressed confusion over Gome and Kuba’s cooperation. An appliance brand company website manager believes that Gome\\'s dual-brand strategy is \"like watching flowers through mist.\" Both Gome Online Mall and Kuba sell Gome’s offline products. Selling the same products inevitably leads to competition. As a child “raised by a stepmother”, Kuba will be at a disadvantage in the competition with Gome Online Mall and will eventually disappear. Peng Liang said that Kuba’s sales growth of more than 300% in 2011 proved that this cooperation was correct. The home appliance industry itself is a highly monopolized industry, and in the past ten years, there has been no new brand with representative characteristics in the Chinese home appliance industry. It is therefore difficult for an individual to create a brand in the industry. Kuba.com started selling home appliances online in 2006, and was one of the first websites to sell home appliances in China. However, by 2009, we saw a \\'ceiling\\' in our development. Many of the difficulties we have faced in the past, including supply chain challenges, are likely to be encountered by other websites as well. Gome has a purchasing scale of more than 100 billion yuan, and it occupies an advantageous position in the industry. In our cooperation with Gome, we integrated Gome\\'s supply chain resources, which enabled us to reach the current scale. This cooperation is a win-win situation. Han Depeng, the general manager of Gome Online Mall, told the Electrical Appliances that after the Gome Online Mall was revamped and launched, it achieved a 600% increase in sales in just one month. This also serves as a side proof of win-win cooperation.']\n"

By Andy921 Recently, LG has successively released three low-end straight phones abroad, GS106, GS107, and GS155. LGGS106 and GS107 are designed quite similarly, the main difference can be seen from the picture, which lies in the design of the navigation keys, GS106 adopts a metal key design, while GS107 is a plastic design. The parameters of the two machines are very similar, both using a 1.5-inch 128*128 pixel screen, the same body size and weight, with a size of 103.9x43.5x12.9mm and a weight of about 70 grams. From the words below the screen, it can be seen that the two phones are mainly FM radio receivers, which is also a relatively good selling point in low-end phones. In addition, the two machines are equipped with a standard 950mAh lithium battery, support GSM 900/1800MHz network and microUSB connection. The other LGGS155 focused on the color of the mobile phone body, and the GS155 launched up to five colors. The hardware parameters of the mobile phone are basically the same as those of GS106/GS107, with a screen of 1.5 inches 128*128 pixels, and also supports FM radio function, but the size and weight are slightly different.

      "['罗素,DeronWagner', '正向', 'Daily watch: USD ETF bounces back to major support Yesterday, the US stock market opened slightly higher, but immediately reversed and plunged sharply in the morning. By midday, all major stock indices had fallen by more than 2% from their intraday highs, with volume also surging. Although the downward breakout in the morning was decisive, the major indices stabilized in the afternoon and rallied strongly, but there was some selling pressure in the last hour before the close. Overall, the afternoon rally greatly boosted the bulls\\' confidence, as it clearly meant that investors were buying on the dips. The Russell 2000 small-cap index bounced off the 200-day moving average, closing down just 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly by 0.3%. The S&P 500 closed down 0.4%, while the S&P 400 Midcap index and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Most stock indices closed slightly below the amplitude median, but well above the day\\'s low. Volume was up across the board, with the NYSE seeing a 17% increase in volume from the previous session, and the Nasdaq up 26%. Volume declines have caused the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to see another \"distribution day\". Market internals were in line with average levels, with Nasdaq declining volume to advancing volume ratio at 2 to 1 and the NYSE ratio at 1.2 to 1. Although technically yesterday\\'s trading day was a \"selling day\", we cannot say that it was a rather bearish trading day, as both the bears and the bulls had a good performance. Due to the support of the 200-day moving average on the daily chart, PowerShares U.S. Dollar Bull Index (UUP) has returned to our watch list this week: UUP has a strong level of price support from February to April. The weekly chart shows that UUP has retraced slightly more than 50% of the Fibonacci retracement from the December 2009 low to the June 2010 high, thus providing us with a trading opportunity with a positive risk-reward ratio. Additionally, the Euro (FXE) is rising to a huge level price resistance, so it is possible that it will soon resume its downward trend. This UUP position formation is for medium to long-term opportunities, as there is currently insufficient positive price momentum for short-term traders to follow. The 200-day moving average still constitutes a formidable resistance on the daily chart of the S&P 500: although all major indices returned above the 50-day moving average last week, we have not seen a strong follow-up buying that would suggest the market is ready to launch a major rally. Before the S&P 500 index breaks through the resistance of the 200-day moving average, we expect more wide-ranging price movements in the broader market.

      "['王勇,朱永廷,朱淼泓', '正向', 'An elderly teacher sold calligraphy to save his sick son on the street. □ By Wang Yong. Zhengzhou News Agency. Yesterday, a scene appeared on the sidewalk at the intersection of Longhai Road and Songshan Road in Zhengzhou: 59-year-old Zhu Yongting, a teacher at Zhonghua Middle School in Zhengzhou, helped by his wife, spread out his calligraphy works he had written, and wrote on a white paper: \"Sell calligraphy to save my son!\" The old teacher\\'s actions attracted the attention of passers-by. Give love and save my son! Donate a little money, and I will send you a piece of my calligraphy! Zhu Yongting was shouting on the street in the morning yesterday. Zhu Yongting has been teaching for 32 years, and six of his students have won the first place in the college entrance examination Chinese language test. Zhu Yongting said that his hometown was Kaifeng, and his son Zhu Miaohong was 31 years old this year. When his son was four months old, he fell to the ground accidentally while being held by someone, resulting in intracranial hemorrhage. Since then, his son\\'s symptoms have not been relieved, and he has no self-care ability. In 2007, his son was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis after a consultation of experts from the Provincial People\\'s Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Zhu Yongting and his wife have run to hospitals in more than ten provinces and cities for their son\\'s illness, but they have not been cured. Now they are facing another surgery, but the tens of thousands of yuan in costs have made them feel helpless. Many people who passed by Zhu Yongting\\'s \"calligraphy stall\" couldn\\'t help but take a few looks, and many of them gave money to the elderly teacher. After most people donated money, they did not take the teacher\\'s calligraphy works. After one of the company bosses learned about the situation, he took out 1000 yuan and handed it to Zhu Yongting. Yesterday afternoon, the reporters came to Zhongzhou City Huaxia Middle School. The school leaders and teachers said that Teacher Yongting Zhu and his wife never abandoned their son who was seriously ill. The school teachers were deeply moved, and we wanted to donate money to their family several times, but they refused. \"']\n"

      "['陈琼,秦洪,马佳颖', '正向', 'Can the large-scale increase in holdings by China Investment Corporation trigger a market rally? Host: Chen Qiong Special guest: Senior market commentator Qin Hong Special guest: Cinda Securities Analyst Ma Jiaying Host: According to the announcement released by China Construction Bank on the evening of December 2, China Investment Corporation has increased its holdings of China Construction Bank A-shares through the Shanghai Stock Exchange by more than 70 million shares from September 23 to November 28. This is the second time that Huijin has increased its holdings in ICBC. Compared with the previous purchase of 20 million shares, Huijin\\'s move this time is quite \"generous\". What do you think it reveals? Qin Hong: One is to maintain the stability of shareholding, because foreign banks will hold more shares of the Bank of Communications. Second, to demonstrate the efforts of CSFI to stabilize the A-share market. Jiaying Ma: Since October, the authorities have been taking swift and forceful measures to boost the real economy. If the three favorable measures announced on September 19 were intended to boost market confidence, they were more of a “show of support,” then this time the authorities have really taken the issue of the capital market seriously, as can be seen from the recent large-scale purchase of shares of China Construction Bank by China Investment Corporation. The host said that the announcement released by the Construction Bank on December 2 also said that H-share of 19.58 billion shares held by the China Huarong Asset Management Company was transferred to Bank of America, and the shareholding ratio of Bank of America increased to 19.13%. Some market players believe that the US bank’s large-scale increase in its holdings of ICBC shares is a prelude to its subsequent reduction. How do you see it? Ma Jiaying: It is worth thinking about why US banks, when facing a financial crisis at home, a capital adequacy ratio and liquidity in trouble, still massively increased their holdings of shares in ICBC. As stipulated in the agreement, the US bank\\'s increase in holdings cannot be transferred before August 29, 2011, so it is unlikely to make a large-scale reduction in the short term. The host: How will CICC\\'s increase in holdings affect the A-share market and bank stocks? Qin Hong: It will improve expectations for the A-share market, at least it can reflect the efforts of the management to stabilize the market and the underlying expectations. For bank stocks, this can also improve valuation and signal to the market that bank stocks have clearly become undervalued, and bank stocks may have reached the bottom. Jiaying Ma: I think, first, due to the large-scale reduction of weight stocks, especially bank stocks, by institutional funds mainly based on funds in the early stage, the increase of Huijin this time has the meaning of indirectly establishing the confidence of institutional investors by the management; second, in the recent A-share market, the trend has been摆脱the interference of the foreign market and has been oscillating in a narrow range between the 30-day moving average and the 60-day moving average. It is not easy to say how long the market can maintain a consolidation, and Huijin\\'s large-scale increase of bank stocks at this stage will to some extent stabilize the market center and add another support to the support around 1900 points. However, given the global economic trends and our expectations, we do not see a systemic opportunity in the A-share market. Therefore, I believe that the CSRC\\'s purchase of bank stocks is only to stabilize the market and will not lead to a significant rise in bank stocks and the A-share market. Host: Yesterday afternoon, the market showed a rare volume increase, was it also due to the boost brought by the increase in holdings by China Securities Finance Corporation? Qin Hong: There is a certain necessary connection between the two. This signal, together with the increase of the social security fund\\'s investment in the secondary market, reflects the trend of continued warming of the policy face. Jiaying Ma: With the market enthusiasm fully mobilized under the background of policy support, the rise of large-cap weight stocks such as bank stocks and coal stocks is different from that of theme stocks participated by speculative funds. It must have a fundamental support, but the current environment obviously does not have such an environment. So, I am personally cautious about the blue chips, which may mean that the rebound is coming to an end. Host: Can a series of actions such as CMBI\\'s increase in holdings and the Social Security Fund\\'s increase in its position be regarded as a signal that \"the market bottom has arrived\"? Qin Hong: There is no necessary logical inference. Ma Jiaying: Currently, the Shangzheng Index has returned to the vicinity of the 60-day moving average. This is the third time that this key point has been challenged since the rebound. At this time, the blue chips are starting, with the intention of forcing the index to break through the 60-day moving average. However, if the index is pushed to break through the 60-day moving average by pulling up the index, I personally feel that its sustainability is not strong.

Apart from singing and dancing, all hosts transformed into \"magicians\" and amazed the audience. This is a major event of the 17-day Spring Festival Gala of the Eastern Satellite TV, \"My Appointment with Spring\", which has been held for the sixth time this year. In order to welcome the World Expo, the \"appointment\" of the Year of the Tiger has been comprehensively upgraded and will be broadcast on the Eastern Satellite TV at 7:30 p.m. tonight (the eighth day of the first month). All the famous hosts from all over the country have joined Zhejiang TV for Zhu Dan\\'s first song. Because of the popularity of the 2009 nationwide host \"Dance in the Forest\", many famous hosts from all over the country have developed a deep affection for the Eastern Satellite TV. This time, \"I Have an Appointment with Spring\" has truly become a carnival party for hosts. The leading lady Zhu Dan from Zhejiang TV, Chen Chen, the beautiful host from Beijing Satellite TV, Nadiya from Xinjiang Satellite TV, Jiang Yuting from Yunnan Satellite TV, and Zhang Yangguoer, the happy nut from Anhui Satellite TV, have all joined in. In addition to the beautiful hosts, Shen Ling, Liu Gang, Liu Erjin, and other multi-talented male hosts have also joined in, singing and dancing, using all their skills. Many famous hosts from all over the country have come to the Eastern Satellite TV to drop their important programs. For this, Lin Hai, the overall planner of the evening, expressed his gratitude: \"I would like to especially thank the hosts from other TV stations, who really worked very hard.\" Zhejiang TV\\'s leading lady Zhu Dan chose to debut her latest single \"Think of\" at \"Me and Spring Have an Appointment\". She held hands with Lin Hai and said, \"Thank you to everyone in my life. I cherish you very much.\" Foreign songs are at hand, and Cao Kefan dances to \"Nobody\" and \"I Have an Appointment with Spring\". This year\\'s evening has a clear theme, and the evening is divided into several parts. The first part is the round singing of zodiac songs, and Cheng Lei\\'s \"Descendants of the Dragon\" and Ni Lin\\'s \"A Thousand Years in Waiting\" have won applause. To welcome the World Expo, the hosts were required to sing foreign songs. Of course, they were not difficult for them, who were good at singing. Whether it was Jin Wei\\'s imitation of Vitas, or Ni Lin\\'s passionate rendition of the theme song of \"Blood and Love\" in Japanese, it brought the party to a climax. You sing and I dance, in addition to performing beautiful songs, of course, there is also dancing, especially the most popular dance of 2009, \"Nobody\", which once brought the climax of the scene. Cao Kefan, Liu Gang, these male hosts who are completely unrelated to dancing, unexpectedly became the main characters. The clumsy and lovable performance, combined with the sturdy figure, made the audience laugh continuously, leaving a deep impression. Lin Hai revealed: \"To make Teacher Cao dance this dance, we took a gradual infiltration approach.\" Cao Kefan himself was also excited to say, \"I only rehearsed for one day, mainly to be the cushion for Lin Hai.\" “Dai Jun” Retro “sang “Ailian” this year. There is also a section of classic old songs in “I have an appointment with spring”. Cao Ke Fan sang Wang Jie’s “Annie” on a motorcycle, which was quite a taste. Dai Jun, the original singer of “Ailian” that was popular all over the country, sang the familiar melody again after many years. The audience at the scene gave a warm applause, and many of them were red-eyed. The background was also equipped with Dai Jun’s style when he performed “Ailian” in the past. Each generation of viewers relives the past in a series of golden songs. The hosts\\' performance of magic tricks was a real embarrassment this year, and the performance of magic, which was specially added this year and was called the \"most difficult\" by Lin Hai, the overall planner: it is not difficult for the hosts to sing and dance, but performing magic is troublesome. Dandan, Nali and Beibei\\'s quick costume change amazed everyone; Cheng Lei, Wang Guan, Xiaofeng and Jiang Yuting performed a heart-stirring floating act. When Wang Guan successfully floated in mid-air, the audience was amazed. When it came to the four female hosts, Zhou Jin, Jixueping, and the others, it was rather embarrassing. First, Zhou Jin\\'s little fish came out of the fish tank early, and then Wang Guan\\'s goldfish bit her clothes tightly, refusing to let go. This magic show brought more laughter to the audience. But it is still worth praising that hosts who are usually busy with work can understand the essentials of magic in a short time. Lin Hai, the overall planner, modestly said, \"I dare not expect the ratings, and this year is just a trial.\" \"']\n"

And with only Ghana qualifying for the quarter-finals from the two continents of Asia and Africa, Asian and African football continue to live in the shadow of European and American football. The scent of turmeric evokes the Dutch countryside and windmills, while their football is often a symbol of tragedy. This is not a joke, Dutch football led the storm of total football and attacking football, but they have never won the World Cup. But this time, the tulip finally waited for the bud to bloom, and the appearance of a group of excellent players such as Robben, Sneijder, and van Persie made the Dutch people see the glitter of the golden cup. And Van Marwijk\\'s tactical system not only met the prevailing style of play at the time, but also brought out the best in the characteristics of the Dutch players. And under the guidance of this benevolent father, the Dutch players put aside all personal grudges and focused all their thoughts on the game.

In the last Germany World Cup, in the 1/4 final, the Germans eliminated Argentina by penalty shootout, almost creating a \"winter fairy tale\". But in this World Cup, we saw a Germany team that was familiar but not entirely familiar. With the same iron will and the same iron blood, this German team is more gentle, with the exquisite front cooperation and foot skills of the Argentinians. The German team, while winning game after game, has brought us a visual feast with a strong impact. Another halo that envelops the German team is sunny and handsome. More and more female fans are falling in love with the German team, and coach Löw has become a spokesperson for the trend. In this season\\'s European competitions, the Germans were always at the center of the topic. The German youth team won the European youth championship one after another, and the German club teams rushed into the top European leagues. This series of good news has made German football return to the ranks of top teams. For the current German team, the biggest problem is that the team is too young, and if they can adjust their mindset, these young people may perform a wonderful \"winter fairy tale\" on the land of South Africa. The Sahara of Africa African football has brought us too many surprises. In the summer of 1990, Cameroon defeated the Pampas Eagles in the opening match in Italy; in the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup, the young guards of Senegal once again made the French bow. However, this time in South Africa, they were almost wiped out, and if it were not for the Ghanaians grabbing the last straw, the Africans would have ended the World Cup with a shame. Ghana\\'s excellent performance in this World Cup has made all fans dazzled, they have the South American delicate footwork, and a group of players in European leagues have brought the overall concept of European football to them. At the same time, the Ghanaians also reminded the African teams to make good use of the power of immigration. The No. 23 player of the Ghana team, Boadu, was born in Germany and previously had dual citizenship of Ghana and Germany, and he had also been selected into the German youth team. However, before the World Cup, the Ghana Football Association accepted him, and he successfully represented Ghana to play, and performed excellently in several matches. There are many players with similar experiences in Europe. The decline in the strength of African teams in this World Cup is obvious, excluding the luck factor of the group, African teams have not shown the determination to win. In recent years, there have been more and more factors hindering the development of football in Africa. Few African countries have a complete league system, and more and more teenagers lack systematic youth training guidance. And the European league has repeatedly restricted the joining of non-EU players, which has also made more and more teenagers who aspire to the European league give up their nationality. Due to a series of unfavorable factors caused by poverty, African football, which was once glorious, has fallen into a football desert. Asia would have been left out again if not for the excellent performance of South Korea and Japan in this World Cup. The fine details of the tactics, the free-kick skills, and the never-give-up spirit have become the banner of Asia. The Korean team has the concept of stars on this basis, while the Japanese football, after many years of exploration, has its own striker. This World Cup will be a stage for Park Ji-sung and Kiyoshi Hasebe to show their talents. After scoring in the first match, Park Ji-sung became the core force of the whole team of South Korea in the following matches, and even when South Korea was behind, the South Koreans still fought bravely under the leadership of Park, the big boss. And the young Japanese player Gouzo Honda became the soul of the Japanese team, his delicate footwork and fighting spirit in the front field made the whole world feel the strength of Asia. This World Cup, Asia has 4.5 spots, and the four teams that ultimately qualified for the 32 teams all left an impression on the world. With South Korea and Japan advancing to the 16th place, AFC can reasonably demand a spot from the underperforming CAF. Of course, in order to really compete with the world\\'s top teams, Asian football still has a lot of important things to do. Refusing black whistle and refusing fake games, these slogans that have been shouted for many years have not yet stopped the negative impact of gambling forces on Asian football. And Asian football cannot rely solely on Japan, South Korea, and the西亚球队 Middle Eastern teams; we in China must catch up as soon as possible. The success of the brothers Gu has a share of luck, on the other hand, it also relies on the team\\'s overall strength. Paraguay has always been good at defending, and they only conceded 1 goal in 4 matches, their excellent defense is beyond the reach of all teams. In the next match, Paraguay will face Spain. Whether Paraguay can continue their good defense against the powerful Spain will be crucial. Compared with the whole of Paraguay, Uruguay is more skilled in individual skills, and the individual abilities of Franch and Suarez will become the devil of Ghana\\'s back line. Of course, Uruguay\\'s weak midfield control will likely put them at a disadvantage in the match. Of course, both of these teams have a big advantage in this World Cup, that is, many of their players come from their own leagues. Due to the heavy burden of European professional leagues, many big-name players were injured before the games, and the European leagues did not end until half a month before the World Cup, so for European players, the dual fatigue of body and mind made South American teams more outstanding in this tournament. Who could have imagined that Maradona and Argentina would sail smoothly through the World Cup, with the outside world believing that this first-class player, third-class person, and unskilled coach would lead the Argentine team to an irretrievable abyss. But everyone was wrong, Maradona\\'s seriousness and perseverance have already transformed the Pampas Eagles. After Messi was successfully molded into a playmaker by Maradona, Messi gradually emerged from the midfield after retreating from the forward line, but it disappointed all Argentine fans that Messi has not scored so far. Instead, Iguan was at the top of the scorer list with his assist. As Argentina’s best helper for Brazil, it bears the glorious mission of eliminating Germany from South America. With the team on track, these little sprites寄托 their longing for the championship with their perfect performance. Brazil\\'s dominance in South American football is unparalleled. In the streets and alleys of Rio de Janeiro, you can see boys playing football everywhere, and it is this atmosphere that has created the glory of Brazil with five stars. Deng Jia led the Sun Boys, Kaka, the Bike Boy, Robinio, and the Roaring Lu Xio, and wherever the Brazilian team went, they were the focus of the spotlight. And the performance of the Samba军团 in the previous four matches, as well as the advantage of heaven, earth, and people, has given us hope for the sixth star. Brazil was treated differently from other teams as soon as it arrived in South Africa, and most of the fans in South Africa, apart from supporting their own teams, supported Brazil the most. After the South African team was eliminated, the Brazilian team became the spiritual寄托of the South African fans. So far, all the World Cups held in the Southern Hemisphere have been won by South American teams, which has made fans who believe in the curse even more eager to see Brazil\\'s performance. In this World Cup, Dunga\\'s team has become more European in its tactical choices. With counter-attacking tactics in vogue today, the Brazilians have also joined the ranks of this tactic. In the match, you will find that the beautiful samba dance is gone, replaced by practical passing and cutting cooperation. And if a Brazilian team were to defeat European teams in the European way and ultimately win the trophy, should European teams learn from the strengths of American teams in future matches?

      "['豪格,罗伯特-豪格,HelmutLense,诺伯特-豪格', '正向', 'Haug denied that Mercedes would withdraw from F1 in the future, and the future rules would decide the fate of the Mercedes star. Mercedes F1 team manager Robert Haug refuted the rumor and denied that Mercedes would withdraw from F1 due to the \"perjury door\" incident of McLaren. This week, the German media Stuttgarter-Zeitung analyzed in an interview with Helmut Lense, a member of the Daimler supervisory board, that due to the gloomy situation of the global automotive industry and the possible further punishment of McLaren for the \"perjury\" incident, Mercedes is under pressure. Mercedes, which holds 40% of the McLaren team, may withdraw from F1. Today in Bahrain, Norbert Haug, the three-pointed star’s car boss, denied it. Some people hinted that Mercedes would withdraw from F1. NO, Mercedes will not withdraw. \"Haag said to Auto Motor und Sport in Bahrain on Friday.\" But the Germans do acknowledge that the current industrial situation does make the participation of car manufacturers in the race uncertain. Of course, every honest person is considering the current situation, which is a fact. Our sponsorship behavior does indeed always exist with uncertainty. I can\\'t predict what will happen in the automotive industry in the next two, three, four, or five months, and I can\\'t predict whether the industry situation will improve. But if you sell more cars, your situation will definitely be better. \"Haag analyzed,\" he said. He then pointed out that the decision of whether Mercedes would remain loyal to F1 in the long term was not the \"perjury\" incident that people were discussing, but what kind of rules F1 would have in the next few years, especially the issue of whether F1 would introduce a budget cap. As it stands, everything is as usual. The media\\'s understanding is that as long as you face the FIA hearing, they will think that your future is in doubt. But the general view is that the first thing we need to be aware of is the overall economic situation of the automotive industry. It is impossible to make a commitment that Mercedes will remain loyal to F1 in the next five years when people ask me. More importantly, can we find a set of rules, whether caps or budget ceilings, that, if possible, would be helpful. This requires the FOTA and FIA to work together and negotiate, and everyone needs to take it seriously. This is a very serious and real problem, and there must be no negligence or shirking of responsibility. Is it now about the diffuser and whether or not to use KERS? All the teams should consider the important things. Haug continued. (Traveling Cloud)']\n"

The police launched a swift investigation after receiving the report and arrested the three suspects involved in a cross-provincial crime within 12 hours. Recently, the Huangpu Procuratorate approved the arrest of the suspects Kong Mou, Lisi, and Tang Mou for the crime of kidnapping. Kong, a jobless person from Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province, conspired with his fellow townsman, Li and Tang, to kidnap for financial gain. Kong provided his friend Mr. Li, who was engaged in construction projects, with information about his family and address. Li and Tang used the funds provided by him to purchase baseball caps, cloth bags, tape, knives, anesthetic sprays, and fake Shanghai license plates in advance, and rented a black car. Since September 12, Li and Tang have been waiting at Mr. Li's residence several times to kidnap his wife, but they failed to find the right opportunity.

Then the two people called to extort RMB 10 million from Xiao Jie's parents as ransom, threatening to kill him. After the police received the report, they immediately launched an investigation. After locking down the location of the suspect, they launched a swift operation.

Among them, only 3 companies disclosed in the week after the Spring Festival; 15 companies in the second week; 37 companies in the third week; and 103 companies disclosed in a concentrated manner in the last week, accounting for 65.19% of the number of companies scheduled to disclose annual reports in February. 浦发、民生月底秀年报According to the performance of the listed companies that disclosed their annual reports in February, 10 of them were in loss, accounting for 6.37% of the total, and the negative impact was not significant. Statistics show that among 157 listed companies that disclosed annual reports, only 4 have a total market value of more than 50 billion yuan, namely,浦发银行, 民生银行, 五粮液 and 苏宁电器. Pre-increase扭亏for profit stocks are thriving. By analyzing the financial indicators of the first three quarters of the top ten listed companies with the highest earnings per share, it can be seen that the company\\'s performance is better, and the earnings per share of the first three quarters of 2008 are all above 0.90 yuan. Besides *ST Malong, which is expected to turn a profit, Yitai B shares, Xingfa Group,步步高, Jinniu Energy, Shandong Gold, and Coal Gasification have all announced increased profits for the first nine months. The remaining companies, including Xiaochangcheng and Yunwei Corporation, have not yet announced increased profits. And the performance快报 of the Golden Bull Energy rose 6.4% this week, and the *ST Malong, which is expected to turn a profit, rose 24.41%. In addition, Gasification rose 11.31%, and Xingfa Group rose 7.53%. February is worth looking forward to, as the characteristics of the February annual report are low loss company ratio, and the blue chip companies and large-cap companies will play a positive role in the latter half of the month. Zhang Gang, a strategy analyst at Southwest Securities, said that the performance of multiple sectors such as banks, winemaking, real estate, commerce, and pharmaceuticals will be affected by the annual reports of major listed companies, and it is expected that most will have a positive impact, and there may be some performance at the end of the month. Based on the development of the annual report season in recent years, except for the fact that there was no annual report season during the launch of the share reform in early 2005, there has been annual report season hype every year, usually starting in early to mid-January and ending in early April. Yesterday, a fund researcher told the reporter that the annual report performance of this year would not be as spectacular as that of last year, but would be a stock performance. Private equity investor Wu Guoping said that a wave of phase strengthening may appear in February and March when the annual report is concentratedly disclosed. As for how high we can go, we dare not be too optimistic. Part of the stock price adjustment is not sufficient, and special attention or avoidance is needed for these varieties. If the performance of these stocks is affected, the stock price may even experience a \"catastrophic\" decline. Journalist Liu Yang related report: artificial performance is hard to last, five companies\\' annual report analysis, under the pressure of annual report, institutions rush into large blue chips, 2009 is expected to continue to rebound, pay attention to the annual report and theme investment opportunities, bank annual report performance is abnormal, 2009 will quickly fall, many listed companies\\' annual report is not optimistic, steel price drop leads to many steel companies\\' annual report performance pre-reduction']\n"

WU Yang, CAO Meng, ZHANG Qingjiang, September 16, 2021, Nanyang, Henan province (China News Network) - In the afternoon of today, the Intermediate People\\'s Court of Nanyang City, Henan Province, carried out the death penalty in accordance with the execution order signed by the President of the Supreme People\\'s Court, and lawfully verified the identity of Liu Xiangyu, a primary school teacher who raped and molested children, and transported him to the execution ground for the death penalty. According to the investigation, in the first semester of 2008 and the second semester of 2009, Liu Xiangyu, taking advantage of his position as a homeroom teacher at a primary school in the Hongniwan Town of Wancun District, Nanyang City, raped and molested several girls aged 6-9 in the classroom, and even molested girls on the podium during class time on multiple occasions. On July 5, 2010, the Intermediate People\\'s Court of Nanyang City ruled that the defendant Liu Xiangyu was guilty of rape and sentenced to death, deprivation of political rights for life; guilty of molesting children and sentenced to 13 years\\' imprisonment, and decided to execute the death penalty, deprivation of political rights for life.  Liu Xiangyu was不服不服 means dissatisfaction or disagreement, but it\\'s not a proper term in English. I will translate it as \"disagreed\" or \"was dissatisfied\". So, the sentence would be: Liu Xiangyu disagreed, and appealed. The Henan Provincial Higher People\\'s Court, after the second trial, ruled to dismiss the appeal, uphold the original judgment, and submit it to the Supreme People\\'s Court for approval. After the Supreme People\\'s Court reviewed the case, it found that defendant Liu Xiangyu, taking advantage of his teacher\\'s identity, repeatedly raped multiple young girls in public places such as classrooms, causing one of them to suffer serious injuries, and the crime was extremely serious. He should be punished more severely according to the law. The first-instance judgment and the second-instance ruling were accurate and appropriate, and the Supreme People\\'s Court approved the criminal ruling of the Henan Provincial Higher People\\'s Court to uphold the first-instance judgment against the defendant Liu Xiangyu. Liu Xiangyu, who was accused of rape and molestation of children, was once widely concerned by all sectors of society, and netizens commented that he was the \"most shameless teacher\" and \"beastly teacher\".']\n"

On the day the winter transfer window closed, Chelsea\\'s offer of 50 million pounds to Torres was finally accepted by Liverpool, and soon Chelsea\\'s official announced that the Spanish forward had officially joined the team. This transfer soap opera, triggered by the player himself submitting a transfer application seemingly out of the blue, has finally come to an end. Afterwards, The Daily Mail revealed that Torres himself had already had the idea to leave the team last year. Torres himself revealed that last summer he was thinking about leaving, as he wanted to take his career to the next level and realize his aspirations as a professional player. Chelsea, a team that competes for all the trophies every season, especially the Premier League and the Champions League, when such a team wants you to join, you can\\'t refuse. Many Liverpool fans are not so enthusiastic about his ambitions and ideals. After Torres\\' transfer was confirmed, some radical Liverpool fans even chose to burn his No. 9 shirt to protest. Liverpool will play Chelsea at home soon, and it is unknown how the fans will treat Torre in the match. Faced with the angry Liverpool fans, Torres said, \"Just like when I transferred from Atletico Madrid to Liverpool, it was like fate, and I just followed it and chose to leave.\" I have never said anything bad about Liverpool and I will never say anything bad about them. Now that I play for Chelsea, I will do my best for the team. Torres also said that he was eager to play in the next match against Liverpool and score a goal, but he would not celebrate to show respect for his former club. When it comes to the new life he is about to start at Chelsea, Torres said, \"I have undoubtedly joined a great team – Terry, Lampard, Drogba, they are all big shots, and I believe I will also be one of them.\" I will work hard to do a good job, train seriously, score more goals, and integrate into the team. I also want to thank Chelsea FC for giving me the opportunity to take the next step. In addition, Benayoun, who used to play for Liverpool, will help Torres to quickly integrate with his new teammates. I was a good friend with Benayoun before, and I am very happy to play with him again. I hope he can recover from his injury as soon as possible. I am also looking forward to meeting my new friends. Almost at the same time as his signing, Chelsea\\'s fan shop immediately launched a jersey with Torres\\' name on the No.9 shirt, and more than 20,000 jerseys were sold at 50 pounds each even before the official confirmation of the transfer. His arrival has certainly sparked a Torres craze among Chelsea fans, with countless fans rejoicing at his signing. For the new signings, the head coach Ancelotti also has something to say: \"I can\\'t wait to meet them right away, their arrival is a dreamlike event for the team.\" The arrival of two leading players one after another has made the Italian hand better. Whether Chelsea can catch up in the final stage and win the Premier League trophy, we will have to wait and see. (Avedo)']\n"

Commentator Cold Ice: Liverpool has no Gerrard, Manchester United has no Fletcher, the absence of two midfielders has caused a subtle change in the balance of the game. Benitez and Ferguson are both versatile, Giggs appears on the left to link up the front, but because Liverpool\\'s midfield is too strong in ball recovery, Giggs hardly made a few deadly through balls in the first half. Torres and Benayoun, who are technically excellent, attack on the right, and Manchester United\\'s attack also shifts from Giggs to Valencia\\'s right wing. But because of the lack of Giggs\\' performance, Rooney and Berbatov were almost silent in the front, which was the fundamental reason why Manchester United only had 2 shots in the first half. Liverpool\\'s problem is that Kuyt cannot replace Gerrard, Benayoun has his own characteristics in breaking and crossing on the right, but Kuyt\\'s ability to seize opportunities is very ordinary under the premise that Torres has opened up the space. So Torres even began to try to break through and dribble on the wing more often, but the old problem of no support in the middle left the Reds with no real threat. In the second half, Manchester United\\'s lack of offensive ability was even more obvious, with O\\'Shea, who was poor at assisting, defending at the back, and Valencia, who was brave but not wise, rushing to the byline to cross. In terms of the double pivot, Mascherano and Lucas are far superior to Carrick and Scholes, and Giggs has fewer opportunities to receive the ball, so he can no longer provide assistance to the front line. In the 65th minute, Manchester United paid the inevitable price for their inability to attack, Ferdinand and Vidic\\'s combination could not compete with Torres in terms of speed, and Torres\\'s goal was only a matter of time. Man United had a slight edge in possession, but there were few passes that found space in the box. On the contrary, Benayoun’s role when Gerrard is absent is almost incomparable to that of Giggs, who occupies a mirror position. In 10 minutes, Ferguson made his tactical changes: Owen came on to play with Rooney to emphasize speed, Nani replaced Scholes to play on the wing, while Giggs returned to the middle to link up attack and defense. Giggs has outstanding personal skills, especially Nani\\'s breakthrough on the left is very effective. The physically exhausted Reds finally encountered a real problem, and Benitez replaced the injured and tired Torres with the tall forward youngster Enogge. Ferguson’s five-man front line, who staked everything on the attack, caused Liverpool, who were playing a more defensive game, a great deal of trouble. But clearly Benitez had Benayoun and Kuyt on for the counter-attack, and they had a distinct advantage over Manchester United. In the last 20 minutes of the game, Manchester United paid the heaviest price for their lack of attacking imagination in the face of Liverpool’s solid defense. Vidic and Mascherano\\'s red cards did not affect the tactical setup of the two teams. As for Engoge\\'s goal in the final moments, Manchester United, without Vidic, could not stop it. At least at Anfield, Benitez’s 451 set up a strong midfield advantage that made Ferguson’s already unimaginative attack irrelevant. Without Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United is indeed very different. Without \"Ferguson Time\" and a bit of luck, Manchester United would not have reached its current ranking.']\n"

And Zhang Hanyu\\'s version of Song Jiang was also praised by netizens as the most realistic one, not only in terms of heroic temperament, but also in terms of the air of a commoner. In the latest set of photos, the golden line on the forehead of Zhang Hanyu is faintly visible, and it fully expresses Song Jiang\\'s martial and literary spirit. Both tough and gentle, with a strong and imposing demeanor. From the time the news of his participation in the new version of \"Water Margin\" was released to the hot shooting of the TV series, the \"flower scarf\" incident received criticism from netizens, but for Zhang Hanyu\\'s \"Song Jiang\", netizens gave him consistent praise. The production team also recognized Zhang Han Yu as the only choice to play Song Jiang from the beginning.

      "['徐一钉,温家宝', '正向', \"The volume may not be a sign of the price of land in Europe and America, and the worries may drag down the A-share market. This week, the A-share market trading volume was 1051 billion yuan, setting a new record for the lowest trading volume in this round of adjustment. After the volume of transactions, is it the land price? Not necessarily! On June 20, the A-share market traded 110.1 billion yuan, setting a new low volume of this round of adjustment, although a rebound from 2,610 points to 2,826 points or 8.27% appeared, the Shanghai Composite Index then set a new low of 2,437 points. Premier Wen Jiabao recently said that the economic slowdown was not beyond expectations, and the orientation of macro-control could not be changed. It may take a while for monetary policy to be structurally fine-tuned as many institutions expect, and funding shortages remain one of the main factors constraining a strong rebound in the A-share market. In the first half of this year, a total of 2,244 listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges achieved a total operating revenue of 10.13 trillion yuan, up 25.78% year-on-year, and realized a net profit attributable to the shareholders of listed companies of 994.33 billion yuan, up 22.31% year-on-year. In the first half of last year, 1,947 listed companies achieved a net profit attributable to the shareholders of listed companies of 784.989 billion yuan, up 41.17% year-on-year. Net profits of listed companies in the first half of this year grew much more slowly than last year. Notably, in the first half of this year, 16 listed banks achieved a net profit of 461.088 billion yuan, up 34.27% year-on-year, and the net profit of the 16 banks in the first half of the year accounted for 46.37% of the net profit of 2,244 listed companies. If excluding banks, the remaining 2,228 listed companies achieved a net profit of 533.24%, with a year-on-year increase of only 13.56%. Clearly, the excellent performance of 16 banks has masked the sharp decline in net profits of the remaining 2,228 listed companies. In the first half of the year, the gross profit margin of listed companies fell by 1.3 percentage points, mainly due to the rising inflation and the rising comprehensive costs of raw materials, labor, financing, etc. caused by the tightening credit environment, which is eroding the profit margin of listed companies to a large extent. The author expects that the year-on-year growth of listed companies' net profit in the third quarter will continue to decline. The latest report from Citibank points out that the global economy, especially that of developed countries, is continuing to deteriorate significantly. The BofA Merrill Lynch model calculations show that the probability of an economic recession in the United States has exceeded 80% according to the latest surveys from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve and the University of Michigan, and the eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell from 50.4 in July to 49 in August. Among them, Germany's PMI in August fell to 50.9 from 52, the lowest level since September 2009. And among the 17 countries in the eurozone, only Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria remain above 50, another sign that the European economy is losing momentum. It is worth noting that, in the face of a poor economic recovery, economic deceleration has replaced inflation as the main concern for emerging markets, and some emerging economies have quietly eased their monetary policies. The central bank of Brazil cut the benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 12% this Wednesday. If there are no unexpected favorable or unfavorable factors, the Shanghai market will maintain a weak equilibrium consolidation in the area of 2500-2600 points. Although A-share valuations are at low levels, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets seem to lack the impetus for a decline. I am concerned that the US economy or the European sovereign debt crisis may flare up again, which would break the current weak equilibrium between bulls and bears.\"]\n"

      "['赫伯特,Argus,Vickers,莫兰德,子衿', '正向', \"US stock market commentary: insiders are buying back stocks: although the stock market was disturbed by Japan's troubles, the speed at which corporate insiders sold stocks last week suddenly slowed to half of the previous week. Mark Hulbert, an investment newsletter expert and MarketWatch columnist, notes that this actually means that insiders have regained confidence and are using the chaos as an opportunity to enter the market. The following is the full text of Herbert's commentary: It seemed that the market was about to suffer a heavy blow under the pressure of insider stock sales, but at this moment, insiders withdrew. To know that such things have been going on for more than a couple of years, and to wonder whether they are just playing with us. At the specific level, let us first understand the response of the insiders during the Japanese crisis last week. According to the view of insiders' behavior research experts, if they continue to sell the stocks of their own company at the previous speed, it means that a super ominous sign has appeared in the market. An omen of ill omen means that they have almost no confidence that the stock price of their company will recover in the short term. Fortunately, they did not do that in fact. To understand the real situation, we can refer to the ratio of insiders buying and selling their own company's stock last week - the latest version of the VickersWeeklyInsiderReport published by ArgusResearch, which provides this ratio. The latest edition of the Monday newsletter shows that the insider buy-sell ratio last week was greatly reduced, only about half of the previous week. According to the data provided by Vickers, this is the lowest ratio since September last year. Jonathan Moreland, the editor of Insider Insights investment newsletter, explained the obvious change as follows: insiders saw the chaos of the past week as an opportunity to buy at the bottom. Last September, when this ratio was last this low, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading at around 15,000 points, nearly 2,000 points lower than it is now. The bulls, finding the insiders had made such a big step forward in the market, of course would be very happy in a similar posture. The investment newsletters tracked by Herbert Financial Digest all chose to increase their positions this week, based on insider behavior. So, what stocks do they recommend to their clients to buy? Vickers recommended the wireless service provider USAMobility (USMO). Moran recommended three stocks, two of which were pharmaceutical stocks: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and Threshold Pharmaceuticals (THLD). Mollander's third recommendation is UraniumResources(URRE). He said it was an “extremely nerve-wracking” choice, given the stock’s price plunge during Japan’s nuclear crisis. But if you want to follow the approach of the insider, your strategy will inevitably be a nervous one, because, like all contrarian analysis strategies, it will often require you to buy stocks that most people do not like.

The college entrance examination will begin on June 7, and the examination affairs will be arranged by the district and county today. According to the regulations, the examination room will initiate the handling method for accidental events in the college entrance examination when there are 20 situations such as mixed examination papers, unclear printing of examination papers, and candidates cheating. The teacher particularly reminds that the foreign language test must arrive 15 minutes in advance. The college entrance examination regulations stipulate that if a candidate forgets to bring or loses their admission ticket, the invigilator may first verify the candidate\\'s appearance. If it matches the photo on the admission ticket stub, the invigilator may allow the candidate to enter the examination room for the exam and require the candidate to bring the admission ticket for the next exam. In addition, the invigilator should record the questions answered in advance by the examinee before the examination signal is given or the questions answered after the examination signal is given in the \"Record of Violating Candidates\". If the examinee experiences a faint or illness, and there are more than 30 minutes left before the end of the exam, the examinee should be isolated for treatment. The teacher reminded the candidates to pay special attention to the entry time for each exam. 20 minutes before the exam (30 minutes before the Chinese exam), candidates may enter the examination room with their admission cards and other relevant documents. It is especially important to note that foreign language tests include listening tests. To avoid affecting other candidates, candidates who are late for the foreign language subject are required to enter the examination room 15 minutes before the start of the exam, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the examination room. Other subjects are not allowed to enter the examination site to take the exam for that subject after being late for 15 minutes. No student may leave the examination room before 30 minutes before the end of each subject. This year, except for math, all other subjects will be graded online. To ensure the scanning effect, it is stipulated this year that the subjective questions of the college entrance examination must be answered with a black ink pen or a signature pen. To make the scan clearer, the teacher suggested not to use too fine a pen, and suggested using a 0.5mm pen. Test takers should carefully read the instructions on the answer sheet in the \"Instructions for Test Takers\" and answer the questions according to the regulations to avoid affecting the evaluation of the test paper due to irregular answers.

The Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open, with a total prize money of about $1.7 million, was originally scheduled to start this morning at the East Course of the RokkoKokusaiGolfClub in Hyogo Prefecture, Kobe, Japan. But after 25 minutes of play, the referee blew the whistle to suspend play at 7:25 p.m. due to the heavy wind and rain. As the rain continued to fall, the tournament officials canceled the day's play at 10 a.m., and announced that the tournament would be shortened to 54 holes. In this way, the first round of the competition will be held on Friday, with the kick-off time still as before. After 36 holes on Saturday, the players who qualify for the final round will be determined, and the final round will be held on Sunday. According to the weather forecast, Hyogo Prefecture will be sunny in the following days. Jittisak Tamprasert, the managing director of the Asian Tour, said that after deliberation, the tournament committee decided to cancel the first day's play because the situation was not conducive to holding the tournament. The Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open will now have three rounds of competition, and the first round will be restarted in the morning of Friday. This is the second week in a row that the Asia Tour has had to cut the tournament to 54 holes due to weather. Last week, the new Asian Tour event, the Yunda TPC Golf Open, held at the LinKou International Golf Club in Taiwan, had to be shortened to 54 holes due to the impact of typhoon weather on Sunday. The 2008 Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open attracted a number of top players from the Asian and Japan Tours, including Liang Wen-chung, the 2007 Asian Tour money leader, 19-year-old Korean star Ryu Tae-yeol, who leads the Asian Tour money list at present, and Higa Ryo, the 2007 Japan Tour money leader. They are all the favorites to win this week, with Chinese veteran Liang Wenchong finishing tied for second in the 2016 Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open, losing only to champion Daisuke Maruyama.

      "['崔晓黎', '正向', 'Prepare to challenge the early high point and pay attention to the opportunities of the two sessions. Yesterday, the two markets fluctuated slightly after opening, and reached as high as 2930 points during the trading process, approaching the two peaks of the two rebounds in mid-February and late December last year, with the support of heavyweights such as real estate and banks. But in the end, the market failed to rise due to the lack of a leading sector, and closed with a small bullish candle with an upper shadow, and the volume also showed a significant increase. The K-line pattern showed a pattern of rising and falling. Overall, due to the lack of mainstream leading hotspots, the market lacks the support of人气to make a sharp upward attack in the short term, and it is still mainly温和oscillation in the later period. From the plate, the leading high-speed rail, heavy industry, water conservancy and other varieties in the early stage have undoubtedly entered the stage of oscillation and consolidation, and the signs of ebb and flow are very obvious. And the agricultural, cement, and other sectors have shown uneven performance, with poor coordination, and graphene is even too highbrow for the masses, making it difficult to stir up market enthusiasm. The market has formed a chaotic situation with each player fighting for themselves, and the majority of individual stocks\\' trends depend on the fluctuations of the index. When the index rises, individual stocks rise, and when the index falls, individual stocks fall. So for most investors, there is currently no clear hot spot for medium-term operations, and they can only adopt a strategy of patient waiting. From the external environment, there are many favorable factors for the market. On the one hand, given that the “two sessions” are about to be held, the market is likely to maintain a stable operating environment, and a large drop is unlikely. On the other hand, the lag effect of the country\\'s tough measures to regulate the real estate market is gradually becoming apparent, and the inflationary pressure is correspondingly relieved, and the threat of monetary policy to the market will be somewhat reduced. Of course, there are also negative factors, the most typical of which is that the market liquidity is still not sufficient at present, and even if inflation eases, the liquidity will not improve in the short term. Moreover, the country’s tone for increasing the proportion of direct financing would remind people of the large-scale expansion of the main board market. Taken together, the external environment will provide some support for the market to maintain stability in the short term, and some policy benefits that may occur during the \"two sessions\" will also stimulate the market to some extent, causing some local hotspots to be active. Technically, the market is operating in a range with upward pressure and downward support. There is a clear upward pressure at 2950 points, and a breakthrough upward requires the cooperation of mainstream leading hotspots and trading volume; the support at 2700 points is strong and will not easily break through without major negative external environmental impacts. It is estimated that this lateral oscillation pattern will continue in the near term to wait for the clarity of the breakout direction of the medium-term. Operationally, before the direction of a major breakthrough is clear, the most stable operational strategy is to wait and see, and to participate in those varieties with small gains in recent periods and no problems in fundamentals with a small position, waiting for the opportunity to rebound and catch up. Once a certain gain appears, it is also necessary to exit with profits in time. For short-term hotspots triggered by sudden policy factors, it is necessary to combine market conditions and also to cash in when the opportunity arises. For Xin Huan Information Cui Xiaoli, the combination of views, the large fluctuation of the golden certificate advisor during the day is conducive to the digestion of pressure. Yesterday\\'s market continued the strong pattern, after four consecutive days of growth, the Shenzhen Composite Index continued to advance courageously towards the previous high point, the highest price during the day reached 2931 points, basically reaching the previous high point, the Shenzhen Composite Index was stronger, closed above the recent high point, and created a new closing high since November 12, 2011. The two markets\\' trading volume continued to increase in a gentle gradient, the price increased and the volume increased, indicating that the incremental funds were gradually entering the market, which was conducive to the continued improvement of the stock index in the future. In the afternoon trading session of yesterday, the stock index showed violent fluctuations, and the SSE Composite Index experienced a continuous plunge when it approached the previous high point, but it regained support and rose again near the 2900-point integer level. We believe that the stock index has accumulated a certain amount of pressure of being trapped at around 2920 points for six consecutive trading days, and it is reasonable for the stock index to show a fluctuation and consolidation at this position. A slightly panic-driven plunge is beneficial for cleaning up the short-term unstable profit-taking shares, which is conducive to the stock index continuing to attack upward in the future. Meanwhile, this also reflects, to some extent, that the main players are looking to the long term. ● Donghai Securities is about to challenge the previous high point. The economic leading indicator PMI released yesterday was 52.2%, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, which is also the third consecutive month of decline, indicating a slowdown in the ring ratio of economic growth. However, we believe that the basic economic situation will show relative improvement after March. First, the increase in new loans in January rebounded, indicating strong potential investment demand from enterprises. We believe that corporate investment demand will emerge as the growth rate of money supply rebounds. Second, real estate investment is expected to improve, as the largest-ever housing security program in China has been fully launched, which will significantly make up for the shortfall caused by the decline in residential investment. Based on the performance of Poly Real Estate and other real estate stocks that have announced their performance in the past, the dynamic P/E ratio will quickly fall below 10 times, and the rebound momentum of real estate stocks is becoming increasingly strong. Second, the overseas economy continued to recover. Recent leading indicators of the economies of Europe and America show that the overseas economic recovery is continuing. Although the Middle East situation has led to a sharp rise in oil prices, it will not have a significant negative impact on the world economic recovery at present, and there are signs that the Middle East situation is becoming clearer. As expected, the tense international situation is expected to ease in the near future, and the peripheral markets have already started to rise continuously, which will stimulate the A-share market to rebound accordingly. It is expected that the market will maintain an upward trend in the next few trading days and break through the previous highs of 2939 points and 2944 points. ● Beijing stock traders rose and climbed more focused on opportunities. Yesterday, the major market fluctuated and rose. In the afternoon, after the banking sector rose sharply, it quickly dived. At the end of the day, the stock index recovered some of the lost ground under the impetus of the two oils. From the chart, the traces of the main players setting the trap are quite obvious. In recent several quick drops, the trading volume has been instantly enlarged, and then the funds have risen to take over the positions, pushing the index to continue to improve. But the main driving force for the upward pull at the end of yesterday\\'s trading was the heavyweights, and combined with the fact that some funds flowed out in net terms in the morning, it indicates that there is a concentrated realization of profits for some stocks with large gains. Thus, while the long-term trend of the market remains positive, the trend of sector divergence will be strengthened in the short term. We believe that as long as there are opportunities to make money during the trading day, they should not become obstacles to operations, and since the medium-term market outlook is positive and the probability of large systemic risks is small, aggressive investors can look for opportunities in sectors such as new materials, cement, agriculture, etc., while conservative investors can continue to control their positions and wait for clear market hotspots to appear.']\n"

      "['佐藤', '正向', 'How much is your house worth? Mr. Sato lives in Nakano, Tokyo, and his son who has already settled in Nagasaki has no intention of returning to Tokyo. Mr. Sato is already 72 years old and his health is deteriorating. Recently, he has been running around the banks to consult about reverse mortgage. Your age, property rights, and other conditions all meet the requirements. Now, the key issue is the valuation of the land and the house. The land with the house, which he had bought for one hundred million yen forty years ago, should be appraised at more than eighty million yen, he thought. But the valuation was 42 million yen, and Mr. Sato did not believe it, so he ran to four banks in a row, and the valuation was about the same. The valuation of the house and the land is the most important part of reverse mortgage, because it is related to the mortgagee\\'s financing quota. In Japan, although each bank has its own designated appraisal agency, the main appraisal indicators are the same, including land price, depreciation rate of houses, current price of houses, and expected future price, etc. Most Japanese banks do not accept apartments as collateral. According to data from 2003, the ratio of land prices to the market value of houses in Japan was 6.9:1. In reverse mortgages, the proportion of land prices is higher, and most people say that the valuation of the house is close to 0, which is also the main reason why most banks do not accept apartments as collateral for reverse mortgages, although banks have not explicitly stipulated that they do not accept reverse mortgages with apartments, in actual operation, apartments are generally refused. In history, the appraised value of a few high-end apartments that were accepted for reverse mortgages was also very low and was not comparable to the purchase price. Actually, the apartment in Japan does contain a small piece of land, but because the area is too small, the proportion of its value in the reverse mortgage valuation is still too small to play a role in preserving value. The amount that can be loaned is usually discounted to about 70% of the appraised value. Thus, financial institutions generally only deal with real estate with an appraised value of 50 million yen or more, and some even require it to be over 100 million yen. For reverse mortgage applicants, banks used to limit the age to 55 or above, but with the extension of the average life expectancy in Japan, most banks now set the age limit at 60 or above, and some products even require applicants to be 65 or 75 or above. The ownership of the property is required to be the loan applicant or the couple as the only property owner. At the same time as signing the reverse mortgage contract, the applicant will be required to sign a will to clarify that the property will belong to the lending institution after the loan period. Promoting reverse mortgages in China is difficult, and there are still many issues to be studied in promoting reverse mortgages in China. Compared with the properties in Japan, there are many differences in the properties in China, such as the houses in China do not include land, the right to use has a time limit, the average service life of the house is shorter, and the house price has been in a rapid price increase channel. What is the average lifespan of a house in China? Data show that the average lifespan of new buildings is less than 30 years. Thus, when valuing such a house, there are too many uncertain variables, and it is difficult to value the house. Therefore, a scientific valuation model needs to be established, which can balance the interests and risks of both the lending and borrowing parties to the greatest extent. In addition, technical issues such as the valuation standard, the selection of the valuation agency, the constraints on the mortgaged property (such as the age of the building and the level of maintenance), the agreement on the loan interest rate (floating interest rate is generally adopted in Japan), and the prediction of the loan term of the borrower, etc., are also some of the issues that need to be resolved well during the promotion of reverse mortgage. What role should the government play? Then, who should be the operator of reverse mortgage? Banks, insurance companies, plus the government. The banks and insurance companies are good executors, but from the actual operation history of Japan and the United States, the government must play the role of a promoter. In Japan, the lending parties of reverse mortgages are divided into government institutions and private institutions. The main ways of reverse mortgage services provided by local governments include: local governments directly providing financing, local governments coordinating financing through private financial institutions, financing through local social welfare associations, and financing through local housing provident funds. In Japan, the government finances loans for borrowers whose property valuation is below 50 million yen, to help financial institutions serve the middle and lower-end customers that they are unwilling to serve. Japanese apartments account for about 10% of total housing, and there is a market of 800 billion yen that is yet to be developed. Because it is a mid-to-low-end market, it is still estimated that the government will need to take the lead in promoting the development of the reverse mortgage market for apartments. In the United States, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an insurance agency, provides insurance services for reverse mortgages, and has the power to directly guide and educate the appraisal agencies on the key point of \"real estate valuation\" directly related to the interests of the lender. This is a great guarantee for the lender, can effectively reduce disputes later, and promote the promotion of reverse mortgage. Reverse mortgages have been difficult and long to promote in Japan, but their benefits to the country and its people have been recognized by society. It is estimated that if 20,000 elderly people use reverse mortgages, it can reduce the Japanese government\\'s expenditure by 10 billion yen. May reverse mortgage soon benefit the elderly friends in China as well. (The author is an expert in the Japanese elderly care industry and a director of the Royal Manor Management Company.) I would like to comment.']\n"

On January 31, the Moody\\'s Investors Service held a press conference and released the \"Mid-Year Outlook for Sovereign Ratings in the Asia-Pacific Region\" report, stating that the overall sovereign credit ratings in the Asia-Pacific region remained stable and even positive. Moody\\'s sovereign credit risk analyst for Asia and the Middle East, Thomas Byrne, said that the sovereign credit ratings in the Asia-Pacific region have not been downgraded as a result of the global financial crisis, and that the fundamentals of most sovereign credit in the region are likely to remain stable over the next 12 months. Since the beginning of 2010, Moody\\'s has upgraded South Korea\\'s sovereign credit rating and India\\'s local currency credit rating, and adjusted Indonesia\\'s rating outlook from stable to positive, while Thailand and Vietnam\\'s rating outlook remains negative. Bain noted that China’s strong economic growth helped to shape a V-shaped recovery in the region, with strong demand for exports from mainland China serving as a key driver. Most countries in the region have recovered fully to their pre-crisis levels of economic output, and China and other emerging market countries led the global economic recovery in the first half of 2010.

Moreover, Japan’s rating outlook would face downward pressure if policies to consolidate the budget and restore economic growth were to fail. Moody also noted that if China and advanced economies slow down, the growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region will also decline, and the uncertainty facing the growth of advanced economies may also affect the growth intensity of the region in the coming years.']\n"

      "['', '正向', \"Apple Sues HTC for Patent Infringement, Continues the Ring of Lawsuits ChinaByte, June 24, 2008 - According to foreign media reports, Apple has filed a lawsuit against HTC in the Delaware District Court this week, claiming that HTC has infringed on two of its patents. According to the court documents, Apple mentioned four patents in this lawsuit. But two of them were already included in the earlier litigation. The two patents that Apple added to this lawsuit are: -6282646: System that adjusts in real time with changes in display configuration, and -7380116: System that adjusts in real time with changes in display configuration. In early March of this year, Apple sued HTC, claiming that HTC had infringed on 20 of Apple's patents related to the iPhone's graphical user interface, architecture, and hardware. The U.S. International Trade Commission is still investigating Apple’s infringement complaint against HTC. In the absence of a definitive ruling in the previous lawsuit, Apple’s renewed attack is clearly an attempt to exert more pressure. Currently, both companies have sued each other in the US International Trade Commission, requesting a ban on the import of the other company's products. Industry insiders say that many Chinese companies that focus on the overseas market know that litigation, especially patent litigation, is quite common in foreign competition. Apple's lawsuit against HTC, a Taiwanese company, is an example of a large tech company trying to prevent a rising competitor from carving up an existing market. HTC is a smartphone manufacturer, and in 2009, the company ran the Google Android operating system on the phones it produced first. Soon, HTC began manufacturing the Nexus smartphones, which Google widely promoted. In early 2010, HTC launched a new smartphone (Legend), whose design looked very much like the original iPhone. Thus, HTC is regarded as one of Apple’s most threatening competitors among smartphone manufacturers. As of June 9, 2010, it is reported that HTC had only about 100 patents (excluding those being purchased and licensed). This figure is much lower than that of other major mobile phone manufacturers. And the same database shows that Apple has over 3,000 patents, not to mention the large number of patent applications. So, Apple’s strategy is to attack the weakest link of its competitors in order to prevent or at least slow down the pace at which competitors are encroaching on its market.\"]\n"

      "['三军哥,三军,胡双,崔三军,崔大叔', '正向', 'A female college student from Hunan province has been fundraising for a congenital heart disease patient in Guangdong province. She wrote a tweet to mourn her friend, saying \"see you in the next life\". Information Times (Reporter He Jianhui) The Information Times reported on the 20th of this month that a female college student from Hunan province, Hu Shuang, went to Guangdong to raise funds for a congenital heart disease patient. At around 8 p.m. the previous evening, Cui Sijun, a 23-year-old man with congenital heart disease, died after unsuccessful resuscitation at the Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital. Hu Shuang came to Guangzhou again yesterday to see off Cui Sanjun, and left a message on Weibo, \"Brother Sanjun, see you in the next life.\" Upon learning of Comrade Sanjun\\'s passing, the two sisters rushed to Guangzhou early in the morning. At 6:58 am yesterday, Hu Shuang, who was in Hunan, called the journalist in tears, saying, \"Auntie Cuile said that Comrade Sanjun passed away last night.\" I can\\'t believe it, he was just transferred out of the ICU a few days ago. At 10 a.m., Hu Shuang\\'s sister called the journalist to say, \"Hu Shuang has already boarded the high-speed train to Guangzhou. She is not well, and it would be a bother if you could pick her up.\" At 1 p.m., Hu Shuang arrived in Guangzhou. Because she also suffers from congenital heart disease, she looked even more weak and red-eyed. During the trip to Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital by subway, she kept telling the reporter, \"The doctor said that Sanjunguo could at least last a month when I left Guangzhou a few days ago.\" A celebrity in Shanghai has been concerned about San Junge\\'s condition and said that he could invite the best doctor to Shanghai for treatment in a few days. How could he suddenly die so suddenly? San Jun did not sign an agreement to donate his body. At 2:30 PM, after arriving at the provincial people\\'s hospital, Hu Shuang rushed to the ward where San Jun lived before. The nurse comforted her, saying that the young man had already died after being sent to the ICU ward on the 4th floor for rescue last night. Don\\'t cry, go and ask if you can see him again. Hu Shuang then ran into Cui Sanjun’s father, who was handling Cui Sanjun’s funeral. Uncle Cui, seeing Hu Shuang’s red eyes, couldn’t help crying, “Complaining” to Hu Shuang, “Why did you come over? This is just wasting money again.” Hu Shuang said, \"Uncle, what are you talking about money at this time? Can I still see Brother Sanjun?\" But after Mr. Cui Sijun’s father finished the procedures, he took Hu Shuang to the hospital’s garage. The vehicle that carried Cui Sijun’s body had already left for the morgue. Hu Shuang told the reporter that she specially came from Changsha to Guangzhou, one of the purposes was to help Cui Sanjun realize the wish of donating his body. Hu Shuang said, \"During his hospitalization in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Sanjun哥also told me many times that he wanted to donate his body after death.\" He hopes to make contributions to society and that someone will care about his father, who is over 60 years old, and his mentally disabled brother. Unfortunately, because Cui Sanjun did not actually sign a donation agreement for his body before his death, his body can only be cremated. Hu Shuang said, \"The doctor said that Sanjun哥 had not signed a contract.\" And the time has passed, the body donation should be done within two hours after death for all protective measures. Only cremation was possible for Sanguan Ge\\'s body, and his only wish could not be fulfilled. \"Double Sister was tired after running around and was admitted to the hospital for oxygen inhalation. Yesterday afternoon at 6 o\\'clock, after a busy 12 hours, Hu Shuang accompanied Cui Sanjun\\'s father back to the place of accommodation.\" Hu Shuang said, \"I feel a bit short of breath.\" In order to be on the safe side, Hu Shuang went to the hospital for a check-up after settling Cui Sanjun’s father. Because she was a little tired in the afternoon, the doctor asked her to inhale oxygen to recover. Today, Hu Shuang will accompany Uncle Cui to the funeral home to see off the three armies. After confirming that Cui Sanjun had passed away, Hu Shuang took the time to write a sentence on Sina Weibo \"Cui Sanjun\\'s Cry for Congenital Heart Disease\": \"There is no poverty and no disease in heaven... Another strong boy has been added there. Brother Sanjun, I can only be your little sister in this life. \\'See you in the next life\\'.\" Event review The true story of two patients. Cui Sanjun is from Wuyang, Henan. He was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at the age of 7. Due to his poor family background, he dropped out of vocational school and came to Guangdong to work. Last spring, his condition gradually worsened, and his family and he began to seek medical treatment all over the place. In August last year, Cui Sijun registered a Sina Weibo account named \"Extremely Cry\" to seek help, recorded his medical experience, and once said that he was willing to donate his body to help others.

      "['杨磊,程满清', '正向', 'The Fund: The significance of Central Huijin\\'s entry into the market is more important. Securities Times reporter Yang Lei Cheng Manqing The market is looking forward to the favorable policy, and the favorable policy of single-side collection of securities transaction stamp duty and Central Huijin will purchase stocks of the three major banks of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Bank of China is issued at the same time. Fund managers generally believe that timely policy support is conducive to stabilizing the confidence of stock market investors, and that the entry of the CSRC is more important than unilaterally levying stamp duty. Bank stocks\\' rise supports the index, fund managers generally believe that the central Huijin Company\\'s unexpected direct purchase of the three major bank stocks, this move is significant, will form a clear support for the stock market. Because the weight of the banking sector in the Chinese stock market is the largest, accounting for more than 20% of the CSI 300 index, the upward expectation of banking stocks will form a great support for the index. The main role of unilaterally collecting stamp duty lies in the psychological level. After all, with the current transaction level, unilaterally collecting stamp duty can only save about 10 billion yuan in funds annually, which has little direct impact on the liquidity of funds. If investors lack confidence in the stock market in the future, a single reduction in stamp duty will have a limited impact. \"A fund manager in Beijing said. Reviewing the stock market performance after the stamp duty was cut from 0.3% to 0.1% in April this year, some fund managers are still concerned about the effect of one-sided stamp duty collection. Some fund managers believe that the macroeconomic situation and the issue of state-owned and non-state-owned shareholders are still the biggest problems affecting the stock market. The policy of reducing stamp duty can only alleviate market panic. If the international and domestic economic situation continues to decline, the effect of one-sided stamp duty to rescue the market may be negligible. Buying the stocks of the three major banks is a win-win situation, said a fund manager in Shenzhen. As shareholders of the three major banks, the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC) can directly buy the stocks of the three major banks, which can alleviate market concerns about the reduction of N-block shares of bank stocks. And in terms of purchase price, the Construction Bank is much lower than the A-share IPO price, and the Bank of China\\'s closing price yesterday was still slightly lower than the IPO price of 3.08 yuan. Only the Industrial and Commercial Bank is slightly higher than the IPO price. The China Investment Corporation purchases the stocks of the three major banks at or even below the issue price, which is a win-win situation for all parties in the market. Journalists learned from the interview that many funds have been gradually increasing their positions after the Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 2000-point mark. One fund manager said that the decision to increase holdings below 2,000 points was mainly based on valuation considerations, and there was no deliberate attempt to \"gamble\" on favorable policies. After the combination of unilateral stamp duty and the purchase of the three major banks by the Gold Exchange was introduced, the fund will operate in a wave according to the market situation. From the current situation, the phase bottom of the Shangzheng Index at 1800 points has also been basically identified.']\n"

      "['华友,孙冰,董朝晖,诸葛辉,王秦岱,赵旭枫,陈天桥,张先生', '正向', 'After four years of anticipation, Huayou finally received a generous offer from Shanda. The integration may be difficult. Sun Bing, Beijing report. After the plot of Huayou, which was full of ups and downs, finally turned several times between Shanda and an independent consortium, Huayou finally received a generous offer from Shanda. Acquisition is not news for Great Wall, which has been \"shopping\" all over the place in recent years, and acquisition is not news for Huayou, which has been losing money for years and has been on the market for a long time, but the acquisition of a SP and a music company by the \"King of Online Games\" will still trigger countless speculations in the industry and the public. On the evening of June 8, 2006, Great Wall Interactive Entertainment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Great Wall\") and Huayou Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Huayou\") jointly issued an announcement: the two parties have signed a formal agreement, and agreed that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Wall will initiate a tender offer to acquire 51% of the total number of ordinary shares issued by Huayou, with a total acquisition price of about US$46.2 million. This acquisition price provides a 25% premium compared to Huayou\\'s stock price on the previous trading day (June 5). The 51% acquisition ratio is somewhat different from the 80% that was rumored before, but the $46.2 million bid is higher than the $40 million bid made by an independent consortium led by Dong Zhaohui, president of Happy Media. Previously, the independent consortium had been the main subject of rumors of Huayou\\'s acquisition, but Huayou\\'s board of directors rejected its acquisition offer, and the market spread rumors that Shanda would join as a third party and be invited by Huayou\\'s management. \"Acquiring Huayou is in line with our long-standing strategy of interactive entertainment media,\" Zhu Jihui, the spokesperson of the public relations department of Dangdang, told China Economic Weekly, \"Our long-term goal is to be in the interactive entertainment business. We have been working towards this strategic direction, and the acquisition of Huayou is in line with this strategy. We have always been evaluating and paying attention to similar strategic opportunities.\" But Zhuo Hui did not reveal how Great Wall would integrate Huayou. We respect the efforts that Huayou Board and management have made in the past and the strategy and direction they have set for Huayou\\'s future. I believe that with the support of Grand\\'s users, resources, and platform, Huayou will achieve greater development. He said, \"But we are only putting forward an intention at the moment and have not yet launched a specific tender offer.\" This is a series of programs, and what we are doing now is the first step, just that both parties have signed such an agreement. According to relevant reporters, even without any changes, the tender offer would take at least 20 trading days to be completed. Journalists tried to contact Huayou, but the phone of the relevant person in charge was always unanswered. Wang Qin Tai, chairman of Huayou, has not yet appeared in front of the media, but only stated in the official statement sent to the media: \"We believe that Huayou and Suning have a common vision to become the leaders in the digital entertainment industry.\" The complementary nature of the two companies in terms of content, distribution platforms, and user base will provide significant synergies for the future development of both parties. For Huayou, Shanda is definitely a better choice. Zha Xufeng, an analyst from iResearch, told China Economic Weekly that an independent consortium could only provide Huayou with some financial aid, while Shanda could provide Huayou with more resources and help, not to mention that Shanda’s bid was higher. She said. According to an insider of Shanda, Shanda had actually negotiated with Huayou for acquisition as early as 2005, and the deal was almost done. But at the time, Shinei was busy acquiring Sina, and it had limited cash. In addition, there were different opinions among the senior executives, so it ultimately failed to go through. Huayou\\'s stock price was three times what it is now at that time, and it is much cheaper to buy now. The person said. Just a cheap shell? Why did Grandview have such a strong preference for Huayou, even for several years? Despite its self-proclaimed identity as an “interactive entertainment company” and its aspirations to be known as the “Internet Disney,” the public still classifies Shanda as a game company, and its revenues are largely derived from its gaming business. According to the first quarter financial report of Shanda in 2009, Shanda\\'s total revenue in the first quarter was 1.107 billion yuan RMB (about 162 million US dollars), of which the revenue of online games was 1.062 billion yuan RMB. Chen Tianqiao, who started his career in games, seems to have a somewhat complex feeling towards games today. He once tried to shift the focus of Shanda from online games to \"boxes\" (i.e., home entertainment strategy), but it led to a significant decline in Shanda\\'s performance and even a huge loss. After that, Chen Tianqiao immediately adjusted his strategy and returned to games, which led to Shanda\\'s impressive revenue of over 1 billion RMB per quarter today. But Chen Tianqiao and Shanda never gave up on their strategy of interactive entertainment media. Currently, the Great Joy Group owns three wholly-owned companies, Great Joy Games, Great Joy Literature, and Great Joy Online, as well as other investment companies and businesses. Given the vast asset base and deepening business structure of盛大at present, Chen Tianqiao needs another listed company to carry some business modules, so that it looks more like a group rather than just a game company. Zhao Xufeng said. There are many speculations that Suning may use Huayou as a backdoor to list Suning Literature. Shanda Literature was established in July 2008, integrating Qidian Chinese Network, Hongxiang Tianshang and Jinjiang Original Network, which Shanda had acquired previously. Currently, Suning Literature has taken up 80% of the market share of original copyright online literature in China, and its revenue has entered the level of hundreds of millions of yuan. On May 25, prior to this,盛大 announced that its subsidiary, Shanda Games, had filed for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. So,盛大文学 is likely to seek an independent listing as well. Zhao Xufeng does not agree much with the speculation that Huayou was bought just to get a shell for listing. For Shanda, there is no need to do so. Moreover, if Huayou was bought just for a shell, the price of the shell might be a little too high. She believes that as a company that integrates telecommunications value-added services (SP), music and musical production, games, artist agency, and new media platform construction, Suning is more likely to want to enter the wireless field with its numerous paying users, good relationship with operators, mature team, and rich industry resources, and compete for opportunities in the 3G market. 盛大 long ago acquired Shudihong, a company that specializes in mobile games, and the paid reading of Qidian Chinese Literature Network can also be integrated into the mobile platform. If Shanda can integrate the SP and music businesses of Huayou with these resources, there may be better development in the future. She said. Currently, the mobile game business is highly regarded by the industry, and its industrial chain has basically matured. According to the data from iResearch, the number of mobile game users in China has exceeded 150 million in 2008, so some people say that mobile games are on the verge of a \"bloom\". In particular, in the first quarter of this year, with the huge promotion of mobile games, Kingsoft Online achieved a profit for the first time in nearly three years, with revenue of nearly $30 million, reaching the historical peak, greatly increasing the industry\\'s attention to mobile games. Of course,盛大 had no reason not to see such a trend. Integration is difficult: Previously, when Great Prosperity acquired some small online game companies, the price was over ten million US dollars, and a listed company was less than 50 million, which was really cheap. Mr. Zhang told China Economic Weekly that he is a senior executive of a company that was acquired by盛大 (Shanda). But “cheap” Huayou may not be so easy to “digest”. Zhao Xufeng believes that it is actually quite difficult for Shanda to integrate Huayou, because it only gets a controlling stake, and it is not easy to really influence and control this company. According to the financial report of Huayou, the company lost $42 million in 2007, $12 million in 2008, and $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2009. Zhao Xufeng thinks it is still hard to say whether盛大\\'s entry can help Hua You out of the loss, \"It can help them to last for a longer time.\" She thinks Huayou\\'s business line is somewhat awkward, and the profit model is not yet very clear. The business also has breaks. Huayou SP and mobile music business are not very profitable. Huayou\\'s business line is expected to have a bright future, but at present, these are all unprofitable. She said. Another greater uncertainty and challenge comes from the country’s policies and the prospects of 3G. There are still many policies about 3G that have not been finally determined, especially the charges, if they are still very expensive, then these things are unlikely to happen. Zhao Xufeng said. Given the current situation of Grandview, it is not yet ready to integrate Huayou. Great energy is always limited, and Hu友\\'s business is unfamiliar to盛大. Mr. Zhang revealed that \"The integration of the companies acquired by盛大is actually very small. Many times, they just give a sum of money, and how to operate and make profits still depends on the original operators.\" But this company is huge and is its own, and the level of commitment is much less. Mr. Zhang said, \"To buy it outright and just leave it there without any management, let alone to invest in it.\" But the concerns of the outside world, from a certain perspective, do not seem to be necessary. This grand acquisition of Huayou was made through the secondary market, and these 51% are all tradable shares, which can be completely thrown away, as long as they are sold at a higher price than the current purchase price. Zhao Xufeng believes that for both sides, this is not an absolute acquisition, and both sides have room for maneuver and reservation. Zhao Xufeng said, \"This acquisition is essentially for Suning to become the majority shareholder of Huayou, unlike a full acquisition, where they would be responsible for it and not be able to sell it easily. If it doesn\\'t do well, it will become a bad asset.\" In 2005, when many people saw the news of Shanda\\'s acquisition of Sina, they thought Chen Tianqiao was \"talking nonsense,\" and he indeed could not enter Sina\\'s board of directors to realize his beautiful wish of integrating Sina\\'s resources for Shanda\\'s use. But soon after, he sold his Sina stock, successfully extricated himself and turned around to make over 100 million US dollars. So Chen Tianqiao once again told everyone that he would never be a loser.']\n"

When talking about the change of Shaanxi men\\'s basketball team from Yali to Lithium Power, a person who knows said with a smile. At least, even Liuyuan Club’s “ringleader” Liang Ruilin did not deny this fact in public interviews with the media. The investment party, Lithium Power, and the Yaloo Sports Industry Group Co., Ltd. are actually related by a common lineage. Yalv Group controls Zhehai Lithium Power, and has invested in three more Lithium Power companies in Tangshan, Changchun and Liaoyuan based on Zhehai Lithium Power. These four companies also form part of the Chinese Lithium Power Group with other companies. Since the club has already returned to Yalv, and lithium source power products are Yalv\\'s new investment main business, the new name of the team will be named after the name of lithium source power. Since lithium power is now completely comparable to \"new wine in old bottles\" compared to the era of Yalv, it is only natural to continue the思路 of Yalv, and the idea is to save money first. From the bare playoff last year without any foreign players, to the \"no one left\" of Daliang, Zhang Wei, Chen Zhaosheng, and Dayong, and then to the release of the last big boss. No matter how dazzling the sign of \"cultivating new people\" is, it can never cover up the fact that it is \"self-destructing martial arts\". Can\\'t see the future, such decision lithium source can grow? \"In the new season, our slogan is: to train new people. We hope that fans and the media will understand us, and we will do our best, but the results will definitely not be as good as last year. When looking forward to the new season of the Lithium Source men\\'s basketball team, the new head coach Shliping said so. The team needs new players, and new players always need time to grow. These vast fans of San Qin naturally understand and are tolerant. But to turn this “short-term pain” into no pain at all, the “technological content” involved is far from a problem that can be solved by just saying slogans. During multiple chats with reporters, \"Magic Coach\" Wu Qinglong has repeatedly stated that the cultivation of new players must respect the laws of basketball, and they should be improved in terms of their ability to use technical and tactical actions, their ability to perform on the spot, and their experience in dealing with games, on the basis of maintaining their confidence. With the current roster of the lithium source men\\'s basketball team, it is expected that these young players, who were not fully trained in the second team, will shoulder the heavy responsibility in a short period of time. Is it \"helping the seedling grow by pulling it up\", or \"hastening success\"? For this, several veteran coaches of CBA also said, \"Now, the kids of Shaanxi team, their level in youth league is after the 10th place, without the old players\\' passing and helping, they will be lost if they are forced to play CBA.\" Journalist Zhang Yong']\n"

      "['李琛,陈洁', '负向', \"Publicly-raised funds collectively miscalculated and increased their holdings of financial stocks against the trend, resulting in heavy losses. Heavy holdings of financial stocks put funds in an embarrassing situation. According to the statistics of the reporter, in the just past round of stock market adjustment, due to the proportion of financial stocks (the leading sector to fall) in the position was too large, many stock funds suffered serious shrinkage in net value. After the increase in position, the sharp decline occurred. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, the top seven heavily held stocks of the fund were all financial industry stocks. Among them, China Merchants Bank has 208 funds, Ping An of China has 205 funds, Industrial Bank has 166 funds, Minsheng Bank has 117 funds, CITIC Securities has 110 funds,浦发银行 has 96 funds, and Beijing Bank has 94 funds. There is a clear sign of a significant increase in this figure in the third quarter of 2009. The fund explained that, due to the high valuation of small and medium-sized stocks, the risk is currently high, so they are reducing their holdings. And financial stocks are the most obvious undervalued areas in the entire market. Adding to financial stocks can help avoid risks, and at the same time, it is expected to obtain excess returns. Unfortunately, the expected style shift from small-cap to large-cap stocks did not materialize, and funds once again became the last recipients before the crash. As of February 5, among the top seven holdings of the fund, all financial stocks except for Minsheng Bank were more than 10.31% lower than the market, with CITIC Securities, Beijing Bank, and Industrial Bank falling more than 15%. The plunge of the financial stocks in this round has caused heavy losses to the funds. Morningstar data shows that the number of funds with a decline of more than 10% by February 5 has exceeded 120, and the heavyweights of these funds are mostly financial stocks. Why does huddling together for warmth fail? But it is worth noting that the fund seems to have picked the wrong financial stocks, and the wrong companies within those stocks. With only 9 funds, the China Merchants Bank, which has fallen only 4.62% so far this year, is the stock with the shallowest decline among all financial stocks. Guangda Securities and Shenzhen Securities, which have fewer than 5 funds, have even seen increases so far this year. Among the insurance companies, CPIC, which has the fewest funds in the insurance industry, has only dropped by 8.82%, making it the only insurance stock whose decline has not exceeded 10%. This also shows that financial stocks with a concentration of funds have fallen more than financial stocks with fewer funds. The fund抱团取暖not only failed, but also became a burden. In fact, the financial stocks selected by the funds are generally of better quality than the financial stocks selected by funds with fewer selections. Analysts point out that the failure of the funds to huddle together for warmth is due to the fact that some funds dumped their holdings first. Because there are more funds in the financial sector and the policies are more transparent, it is unlikely that the funds will move in unison. In fact, analysis has pointed out that the champion Huaxia大盘of the fund industry in 2009, had already dumped financial stocks, so it avoided the sharp decline in this round. Another reason is that, from the fund's increased position at the end of the fourth quarter last year, the funds that should have bought financial stocks have already bought them. Thus, when there is a continuous outflow of funds, the funds to take over are clearly insufficient, and financial stocks can only fall. Will you have to buy financial stocks in the future? But, for now, funds are not giving up on financial stocks. Li Chen, an analyst in the fund industry of Xinda Securities, said that from the current situation of fund reduction, the reduction in a single week is only about 1%, and sometimes there will be an increase in holdings. This suggests that, apart from a small portion of funds, the rest of the funds have not significantly reduced their holdings in financial stocks. In terms of performance, although the expectation of a tight policy is strong, analysts still expect the performance of the financial industry to be stable, which is also the reason why funds are still unwilling to give up financial stocks. After this round of decline, the funds have realized that it is difficult to expect high returns in the stock market this year, so the first priority is to pay attention to risks. And financial stocks, after a decline, saw further declines in valuation. After the policy is clear, the fund still needs to buy it, the purpose is not to obtain excess returns, but to obtain average returns. As stated by a fund industry insider.

What was the purpose of him hitting someone, burning the car, and throwing 6 \"gasoline bombs\" at passersby? The burn victim, who has 95% of his body burned and is in the ICU, what is the relationship between the victim and the attacker? It was speculated that the incident was revenge. The scene of the incident>> After hitting someone, he threw 6 gasoline bombs at 12:00 on the 29th, at the west side of 20 meters from the traffic post of South 13th Road, Bao Gong Street, Tiexi District, Shenyang City. Two fire trucks are parked by the roadside, and the scene of the incident is cordoned off with police tape. Beyond the police cordon, a dark green jeep with the license plate number Liaoning AY0548 was parked at the scene. The vehicle had been burned through, and the front and rear windshields had melted. There was a bottle of yellow transparent liquid white wine near the rear door, and a white bucket was placed next to the bottle. There was a black leather shoe under the car. Some burnt clothing remnants were left on the curb less than two meters away from the jeep, and a silver belt buckle fell on the ground, the belt melted. According to the eyewitnesses of the nearby store, the incident occurred around 11:30, when a man drove a jeep and knocked down a pedestrian. After getting out of the car, the driver found that the person was still alive and threw two glass bottles out of the car. At first, we thought he was saving someone, but later we found that both the person and the car were on fire. The witness said that the person who was lying under the car crawled out slowly, stood up and then fell down again. Many people who passed by gathered to help call 120 and 119. A witness said, \"He kept crawling to the roadside, climbed onto the roadside curb, and I saw that his clothes and pants were on fire. He rolled on the ground repeatedly, trying to put out the fire.\" Just then, the jeep driver took out four glass bottles from the car! Another eyewitness described that the driver threw a can of gasoline, because the fire on the pedestrian was even bigger after he threw it. Witnesses said. Another eyewitness said that after the bottles were thrown, a lot of hundred-dollar bills flew out of the car, and the wind blew the money away, and I saw someone picking them up. Soon, the firefighters arrived at the scene and quickly put out the fire in the jeep. The ambulance rushed the injured to the hospital for emergency treatment. The culprit has gone missing>>He is a sturdy middle-aged man. Witnesses from nearby shops said, \"We were all watching the person who was burned by the fire at that time, and no one noticed where the culprit ran?\" Only after the injured was taken away by 120 did everyone realize. The criminal investigation team of the criminal investigation detachment of Tiexi District, Shenyang City, visited a large number of shops in the scene, but did not obtain any information about the perpetrator. At this time, an old man holding a camera said that he had taken a picture of the culprit. But the camera could only see a middle-aged man with a sturdy build and a slightly older appearance. At 15:00, the accident vehicle was towed away by a tow truck. At 4:45 p.m., several families of the injured followed the police to the public security department to make a statement. At 6:00 p.m., the reporters contacted the police station of Baogong and queried the traffic information network for the dark green jeep with the license plate number Liaoning AY0548. It was found that the car had no record of traffic violations, but according to the license plate, the car belonged to Faku County. The perpetrator had not been apprehended by the time the journalist submitted the report at 7:00 p.m., and the case was still under further investigation. It was speculated that the incident was revenge. The patient\\'s condition is critical>>The son cries out, \"Dad, you have to hold on!\" At 1:00 p.m. on the 29th, the reporter met the injured person who had just finished the radiological examination in the elevator of the inpatient department of the Liaoning Provincial Armed Police Corps Hospital. His face was black, wrapped in a white plastic sheet, with a little blood oozing from the corner of his mouth, and a big bump on his forehead. Seeing his father lying on the hospital bed, the son burst into tears, \"Dad, you have to hold on, hold on...\" At around 1:50 PM, the injured person was taken into the operating room, and several family members rushed to the hospital. A relative of the injured told the reporter that the injured was 58 years old, surnamed Tong, who used to work at a market supervision office, and now runs a furniture factory in the Huyu District of Shenyang, specializing in the production of sofas. \"He lives near the scene of the incident, and I haven\\'t heard that he has any grudges with anyone before?\" How could you be so ruthless? According to the doctor who received the patient at the hospital, the patient suffered from extensive burns over the whole body, with 90% of them being severe burns, and the condition was critical, requiring immediate surgery. We are considering tracheotomy for the injured, who has inhalation injury, and the respiratory tract may have problems. The doctor said that in general, patients with large burns need anti-infection treatment, and if the burned skin is infected, there will be trouble with later surgery. Because the patient is older, the doctor has scheduled a skin graft for the patient three days later, and the specific situation will depend on the extent of the patient\\'s recovery. At 3:45 p.m., the patient was wheeled out of the operating room. The doctor said, \"He will be very dangerous tonight, and there may be problems at any time, and he needs to be sent to the ICU for treatment. We will also closely monitor his condition in the next few days.\" \">Lawyer Says >> The man who set fire to the car is suspected of intentional homicide. Qin Dajun, the head of Lingning Chengming Law Firm, said that the man who set fire to the car in the case may be suspected of intentional homicide. He believes that if the jeep driver sends the injured to the hospital immediately after hitting them, he may not face criminal prosecution. But pouring gasoline on passers-by is not a traffic accident crime, but a criminal case,涉嫌 attempted intentional homicide. If the perpetrator has mental problems but no mental disability certificate, they still need to bear corresponding criminal responsibility. In addition, if the victim dies in the end, the perpetrator will face the death penalty. (Comprehensive report) Related: A murder case with a lit gasoline can occurred in Shenyang. The police are arresting the suspect.']\n"

Sina提示: This article belongs to the research report column, which is only the personal opinion and view of an analyst on a stock, and is not a formal news report. Sina does not guarantee its authenticity and objectivity. All relevant information about the stock, as announced by the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges, shall prevail, and investors are advised to pay attention to the risks. Bank of Ningbo is in a period of rapid expansion, with fast capital consumption. We expect RWA to reach around 85 billion yuan by the end of 2009, and financing of 5 billion yuan will increase the core capital adequacy ratio by 5.9 percentage points to around 16.4%. Assuming an annual growth rate of RWA of 40%, ROA of 1.15%, and a dividend payout ratio of 20%, this financing can meet the business development needs of Ningbo Bank from 2010 to 2012. For Ningbo Bank with a high return on risk-weighted assets (RoRWA), timely capital replenishment is conducive to long-term development and the creation of shareholder value. But the financing model can still be improved. First, whether the core capital adequacy ratio and the capital adequacy ratio targets should be maintained at above 9% and 12% respectively still needs to be discussed. Second, if Ningbo Bank appropriately reduced its dividend payout ratio, its core capital adequacy ratio in 2010 could have remained around 9%. Equity financing in this case would be highly dilutive to existing shareholders. After this increase of 430 million shares, EPS will be diluted by 17%, and ROE in 2010 will be diluted from 18.3% to 14.7%. We believe that convertible bonds with secondary terms are a better way to replenish capital than direct equity financing when the core capital adequacy ratio is between 8% and 11%. Managers should seek a better balance between capital adequacy and shareholder returns, and fully leverage. We agree with Ningbo Bank\\'s capital replenishment behavior at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner, although the current plan, although the certainty of replenishing core capital is stronger, but the one-time dilution is large. Although we are optimistic about Ningbo Bank\\'s long-term business development model and management capabilities, the valuation in the short term is not attractive. ——From Ma Junhua\\'s article \"Bank of Ningbo: Financing is beneficial for long-term development, but the method needs to be carefully considered\" on CICC.

The world\\'s largest group buying website, Groupon, has entered the Chinese market through a joint venture with Tencent, which has basically been confirmed. On February 14, the domain name of the joint venture \"Gaopeng\" - gaopeng.com has been transferred to Tencent, and it is said that the transaction price is 980,000 RMB. High Friends is about to go online, and there are not a few people taking advantage of the opportunity to hype it up. Groupon.cn, holding the Chinese domain name of Tuanbaowang, launched an advertising blitz on the national office buildings with the prominent heading of Groupon after the Spring Festival; meanwhile, the domestic group-buying website “Manzuo” also harbored resentment over the reasonable association of the Chinese idiom “gaopeng manzuo” (full of distinguished guests) and the “gaopeng” (distinguished guests) of “Manzuo” (full of), and claimed that it would strictly guard against any infringement by the other party. How to avoid a similar \"HappyNet\" name war when Groupon entered China, became a question to be solved. The Chinese name \"transfer\" yesterday, The NBD News reporters through whois queried gaopeng.com, found that the domain name information has already changed, showing the current holder is Shenzhen Tencent Computer System Co., Ltd. The information shows that the domain was created in 2001, and the previous holder was \"Home of Information Technology Education in Primary and Secondary Schools\". It was renewed in June 2010, and the next lease expires in July 2012. It is claimed that four months ago, Tencent began to inquire about the domain name and bought it for 980,000 yuan. The change of the \"Gao Peng\" domain name proves the previous industry rumors. In early January 2011, Groupon\\'s intention to enter the Chinese market was revealed, and Groupon decided to temporarily abandon the acquisition of independent group buying websites and instead cooperate with Tencent. On February 11, it was reported that Tencent had set up a joint venture with Groupon, with a registered capital of $100 million, and each party holding 50%. The Chinese name of the group-buying cooperation project is \"Gaopeng\". Taobao.com refused to cooperate, and many industry insiders believed that “Gaopeng” was not the best choice for Groupon, but it had no choice because the most suitable domain name, groupon.cn, had already been occupied by the domestic group buying website Taobao.com. Taobao Group was established in March 2010, claiming to achieve profitability two months after going online, and currently covers more than 300 cities across the country. According to Ren Chunlei, CEO of Groupbuy, in the end of 2010, Groupon executives came to China to negotiate cooperation and acquisition with Groupbuy, but they were politely refused. At the beginning of this year, Groupon’s entry into China was announced, and TuanBaoNet took the opportunity to shine. After the Spring Festival, the company launched an advertising blitz on major buildings in Beijing, Chengdu and other places, and announced the launch of a recruitment team of 2000 people. Groupon and Tencent, which lost the best Chinese domain name, finally agreed on the Chinese name \"Gaopeng\" for their joint project, but then another complication arose. There is doubt in the industry that there is already a group-buying website called \"Zuozuo\" in China, and the association of \"high guests and full seats\" may confuse and divert consumers\\' impression of \"Zuozuo Network\"? President Feng Xiaohai of Manzuo Network expressed dissatisfaction. He said that Manzuowang took the meaning of \"a thousand miles of welcome, and a full house of distinguished guests\", and racked his brains to come up with a name when it was founded. Now we can no longer remain silent. If Groupon\\'s promotion in China infringes on the rights of Full Seat Network, we will go all the way. \"']\n"

Sina Sports News. On September 10th, Beijing time, according to ESPN, the NBA season will start in two months, and various new NBA games will soon be released. Recently, ESPN expert Mark Stein obtained some information about the popular game NBAJAM in advance through personal channels. The following is a translation of the original text: NBAJAM is a TV game, the main gameplay is star 3 on 3 bullfight, the style is cartoon and slightly humorous. Currently, most team rosters include 3 active players (all of whom are fan-voted stars) and a legendary player. There are 9 teams with current players in the fourth place because the fan voting statistics are too close, and the game developers can only keep these popular stars. In addition, there are some teams without legendary stars, and there are usually two explanations for this: 1. There are problems with the authorization of the players (such as Michael Jordan); 2. The team lacks history (such as Charlotte Hornets). Moreover, after the game has progressed to a certain extent, players can unlock some hidden players. To our surprise, the Wizards are one of nine teams with four current players, and Yi Jianlian even entered the Wizards\\' 3v3 team with extremely high popularity. According to Stein, the Wizards\\' current roster includes Yi Jianlian, Andray Blatche, Gilbert Arenas and John Wall, while the legendary player is the legendary center Manute Bol, who has passed away. Although Stein did not specify who the most popular star in the team was, according to the ranking of the team\\'s roster, the first place of each team should be the popularity king selected by the fans. For example, the Boston Celtics\\' lineup consists of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, and Ray Allen; the Chicago Bulls\\' lineup consists of Derrick Rose, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, and Carlos Boozer; the Miami Heat\\'s lineup consists of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh. The Orlando Magic\\'s roster consists of Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, and Rashard Lewis. Stein said that Ariza was added to the roster despite not being included in the fan vote due to the negative impact of the \"gun incident,\" but the producers ultimately included him because of his strength. So, the Wizards\\' three most popular players should be Yi Jianlian, Baty, and沃尔. Although Zhou has not yet played a game for the Wizards, he has already become a popular star of the Wizards, which also shows the status of Zhou in the hearts of American fans. In the face of such enthusiastic fans, Alain can only repay their generous love with action in the new season. (Gudu)']\n"

At 6:30 in the evening, the artists began to enter the venue one by one. The most surprising artist was the son of Jackie Chan, Feng Zunming. Zunming said that he came to the wedding today to learn for his future wedding. Although he did not know when he would get married, he still came with his good friends Huang Licheng and Li Jiazheng to participate in the wedding. Feng Zunming, Huang Licheng, and Li Jiazheng are old friends who have known each other for many years in the United States. Huang Licheng and Li Jiazheng also said words of blessing to the new couple. They are the friends of Pi Pi, the female, because Pi Pi, who served as a dancer, had once danced with Li Jiazheng. Lin Junjie and Koo Yulun entered the venue together, and when they saw their friend Tung Tai get married, they also felt itchy to get married and listed a lot of conditions for choosing a partner. Koo Yulun said that he hoped the other party was very good at cooking, could do housework, could write lyrics, and could accompany her to make music. A wife with ten abilities made everyone doubt whether Koo Yulun really wanted to get married. While JJ said that as long as it was someone who loved and protected you mentally and physically, it didn\\'t matter who the marriage partner was, and also wished that Head and Papi could be together forever. After all the guests arrived, the main male and female stars of the night were about to make their appearance. Today, Tapon, wearing a formal suit, and Pipi, wearing a white wedding dress, walked slowly from one end of the red carpet to the auditorium. Many gossip magazines said before the wedding that Tapon was a marriage without love, which made people not expect their marriage. Tapon said that she would use time to prove that she and Pipi were really in love. When talking about the master, Tapon said gratefully, \"Before the age of 20, I was taken care of by my parents, and after the age of 20, I relied on Jay Chou\\'s strong promotion.\" All the gratitude for Master Jay Chou (listen to the song) is written on his face. The biggest climax of the night was Jay Chou, the big boss of the record company JVR, appearing to perform magic. He performed three consecutive magic shows, including conjuring a bride, floating a human body, and making a wine glass appear in a bag. Everyone knows that Jay Chou loves to perform magic, and today he will perform at the wedding because it was Pop\\'s request, and also because the new album to be released soon will have a music video in the form of a magic show. So Jay Chou has been diligently learning magic recently. Halfway through the interview, Jay Chou couldn\\'t resist the urge to perform, and he spontaneously performed a magic show for the people around him. When it comes to Tung\\'s head getting married, Jay first went dumbfounded. Jay said that actually Tung\\'s head is only a little younger than him, and for him, marriage is still a long way off. He expects to get married at the age of 35. Seeing Tung\\'s head get married like a flash, Jay said that it was really unexpected, because he originally thought that Tung\\'s head and Papi would just play around and split up very soon, but he never expected that they would get married. It also made him break his promise and gave Tung\\'s head a gift for a European honeymoon. Because Jay originally did not think that the two would get married, he boasted that if they got married, he would give them a European honeymoon. Now, Tung\\'s head has made a profit, not only with free star performances, wedding red envelopes, but also with a European honeymoon trip. It seems that having a rich and powerful master is very popular. Jay Chou also revealed that his new album will be released in October, and the style of the new album is still the Zhou style, combining magic performances. Jay said that in the new album, he hopes to become a healing song king, and there are many love songs in it, to save the hearts of many broken-hearted men and women now, Zhou-style love songs will explode next month.

Huaxun Financial [Huaxun Financial, June 5th, market review: ] Affected by the performance of the surrounding market and the end-of-day performance of the previous day, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets opened high on Friday. Under the promotion of weighty stocks, the market has created a new high of the recent rebound. However, after the market approached the 2800 point, the upward pressure was slightly revealed. The market showed a strong oscillation adjustment trend. Due to the fact that the collection of opinions on the new rules of IPO is due today, all parties are becoming more cautious. However, at the end of the day, steel and finance led the plunge, and the market quickly turned green. The 5-day moving average of the two markets was nearly lost. From the chart, it can be seen that the number of stocks that fell was more than those that rose, with a ratio of about 3:5. In terms of sectors, the brewing, papermaking, shipbuilding, agriculture and forestry sectors performed relatively strongly, while the cement, power, finance, real estate, and steel sectors performed relatively weakly. In terms of news, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released the ship industry adjustment and revitalization plan; 61.9% of the government's public investment funds were allocated in 2009; the IPO consultation ends today, and the window for the resumption of the IPO is about to open; the $19.5 billion investment in Rio Tinto by Chinalco has been revealed to have failed; the main macroeconomic indicators in May are not optimistic, and the typical early signs of stagflation have appeared; the five power groups have agreed on the coal contract in Shandong, with a price increase lower than the requirements of the coal companies; there are more changes in the iron ore negotiations: BHP has proposed index pricing again. Union Finance believes that the stock market will continue to maintain a high oscillation pattern on Friday. Due to the fact that the deadline for collecting opinions on the new IPO rules today, the market is worried about the resumption of IPO, and the stock market fell sharply at the end of the day, and the two market indices turned green quickly, and there is a desire to test the support of the 5-day moving average. Overall, the market fluctuations are still within a reasonable range, and investors do not need to be overly concerned. It is expected that the market will maintain a fluctuating pattern in the short term. In terms of operations, pay attention to the short-term operation of individual stocks. For stocks with a larger increase, you can appropriately reduce holdings, while focusing on the opportunities of stocks with the potential for catch-up increases.\"]\n"

He will play against Gu Li. The chess谱 of the 15th Japanese Ahhan Togayama Cup Go quick chess was launched at the \"Snail Temple\" of the general headquarters of Ahhan宗 in Kyoto. The champion of the previous championship, Zhang Xugu, won 2.5 points with white stones and achieved three consecutive championships of the Japanese Ahhan Togayama Cup. He will play a champion对抗赛between the Chinese Ahhan-Tongshang Cup champion Gu Li 9 dan on January 17, 2009. Zhao Xuhu, 9 dan, is recognized as the strongest Go player in Japan by the international chess community. His blitz chess skills are particularly outstanding. He currently holds the titles of the two major blitz chess tournaments in Japan, the Ahhan-Tokyo Cup and the NHK Cup. He has also won the Dragon Star War twice. Ko Lian-chen, who has eight dan ranks, did not have as glorious a record as Zhang Xugu. Since he entered the dan ranks in 1988, he has only won the champion of the Newcomers Elimination Tournament in the 31st edition in 2001, and has not achieved anything else that can be shown off. In this year\\'s Ahhan-Tongshang Cup, Gao Li, 8-dan, was very lucky, and after winning the preliminary match, he was in the relatively weaker upper half of the draw, and both strong players, Shinya Yamashita, Go Saint, and Shinya Kojima, 9-dan, were eliminated early. Zhang Xugu, on the other hand, defeated the \"Golden Boy\" Yutaro Inoue, the 25th Honinbo Zhao ZhiXun, and Kojima Satoru, the first person in the Kansai Go Association, in the strong lower half. Based on the strength and past performance of both players, Jang Yucheng, the Honorary Champion and the Junior Go Saint, has an absolute advantage. Both sides opened with two consecutive stars. Recently, the style of Zhang Xu, a famous player, has tended to be extremely \"grabbing first and cleaning later\", always occupying a large amount of territory at the beginning of the game, and then invading the opponent\\'s large space to decide the outcome. This game is no exception. The first round of negotiations between the two parties unfolded from the lower left corner, quickly forming a pattern where Zhang Xu took the land and Koga took the momentum. After Koga Shikanosuke, an eighth-dan player, built a peripheral pattern against a strong opponent, he occupied two star points in a row, with a style reminiscent of the \"Cosmic Flow\" of the former Fujisaki. And Zhang Xue of course was not afraid, and played White 24 to enter the black camp. The two sides entered their first battle in the lower right corner. In response to the confident fighting style of Zhang Xu, the 8-dan Go player Gao Li was very cautious, often taking a long time to think. The white 28 move, which strongly invaded, was clearly unexpected by Gao Li. When the black stone decided to play 29 to cut, the black stones had already used up nearly a third of their time, while Zhang Xu still had less than 10 minutes left. It can be seen that, facing the opportunity to win the first major chess championship in his career, Kojima Seikan is still rather conservative in his thinking. The black stones chose to protect the right side territory, and then invaded the lower left corner to survive, but the thick central strength became a lonely stone in return. At this time, Zhang Xu acutely moved out the right hidden force. Gao Li did not respond strongly enough, and as a result, the white stones continuously pulled the flowers, and after setting up a copper wall and iron fence, they formed a huge threat to the black large group in the center of the board. Since the attack and defense had already been reversed, Kōri Seiken went all in, played a move outside the main flow to defend the upper right corner, and completely turned to territory play, treating the lonely defense in the center as a bet on the outcome. But Zhang Xue did not attack forcefully, and after securing the left upper corner, he penetrated above the black stones to maintain the lead in territory. After several rounds, the upper side changed from black to white, but although the black stones thickened the center, they posed no great threat to the white stones that were as solid as a bucket. The game entered a fine game with slightly better white stones. In the endgame, Zhang Xu played the good move of 122 to break the enemy\\'s air. The thick center of the black stones, which had high expectations, was broken. Kojima Seikenn had no chance to win. Although he finished the endgame, the result could not be changed. After Zhang Xu won the title of the 2022 Ahan-Tōyama Cup, he achieved three consecutive championships in this event and won 10 million yen as the champion. He will play the champion Gu Li 9 dan of China\\'s Ahhan-Tongshang Cup on January 17, 2009, and Sina.com will continue to bring you live coverage and reports, please pay attention to it!

David Joseph, the newly appointed chairman, has made a series of reforms to this year\\'s award, from the members of the jury, the design of the trophy to the award ceremony, forming a new atmosphere. The reform of the jury composition has affected the归属 of the grand prize. The first Brit Awards was held in 1977 and became an annual music event from 1982. The Brit Awards, known as the “Grammys of Britain,” have recently been criticized for their rigid nominations and lack of surprises in award归属. David Joseph, the new chairman, has made reforms this year, not only moving the venue of the award ceremony from the Earl\\'s Court in London to the O2 Arena for the first time, but also reforming the members of the jury. The 1,000 judges in the past were made up of music producers, publishers, and retailers, and this year a batch of music artists joined for the first time. Ultimately, the prize went to a different direction than in the past. The folk artist was given special attention this time, Laura Marling unexpectedly defeated the strong opponents Cheryl Cole and Ellie Goulding to become the \"Best British Female Artist\", and the debut album of the new band Manfredi, \"Sigh No More\", won the most coveted award - \"Album of the Year\". Despite the critical acclaim and mainstream media attention she has received, Marlin\\'s new album, ISpeakBecauseICan, only reached number four on the UK charts. Marcus Manford, one of the main members, was also amazed that his band had won a major award, as a London-based band, it was their first major TV appearance in the UK. Roger Daltrey of the Who presented the award, and said, \"It\\'s great to see that the British music industry still has enough money to throw a party.\" David Joseph\\'s reforms, although showing a left-leaning tendency, did not deviate from the mainstream. Justin Bieber, an idol of youth, winning the award of \"International Breakthrough Artist of the Year\" is the best proof. Back in the day, Take That, who debuted as a boy band, won the first Brit Award for Best British Group at the age of forty. Although the band has won the Brit Award many times, Robbie Williams, a member of the band, has won the most Brit Awards, but did not win the \"Best British Group\" before Take That. Their business was once booming, and after a parting without any joy, Williams began a successful personal career. The remaining four members of the band reunited in 2005 and held the largest tour in British history, with tickets selling out in minutes; their album Progress sold more than 230,000 copies on the first day of release, breaking Oasis\\'s record and becoming the fastest-selling album in the UK. Eight months ago, Williams finally put aside the grudge and returned to the band. At the award ceremony, the band performed a touching scene. Member Mark Owen sobbed to Williams, \"Rooney, thank you for coming back to join us.\" The trophy was redesigned to incorporate the flag element. The metal goddess holding the shield at this year\\'s Brit Awards was transformed into a beauty wearing a dress with the pattern of the British flag. In terms of the awards, seven domestic awards and six international awards were almost evenly matched, but this year\\'s Brit Awards seem to place more emphasis on rewarding outstanding domestic artists. Rap singers Tinie Tempah and Plan B are both from London. At 22, Tinie Tempah, who released his first album, Disc-Overy, last year, won the awards for “Best British Breakthrough Act” and “Best British Single.” When accepting the award, he said that he would dedicate the honor to British music representing \"peace and love.\" Plan B succeeded in the transformation with the concept album The Defamation of Strickland Bank, becoming the UK Albums Chart champion and winning the \"Best British Male Artist\" award. At the international awards, the Canadian rock band The Archies won the most prizes, taking home the \"International Best Group\" and \"International Best Album\" awards. They just won the Grammy Award for \"Album of the Year\" for their new album \"Suburbia\" two days ago. When lead singer Wayne Butler made his acceptance speech, he thanked the British bands that had influenced them: from New Order to David Bowie, The Clash, Culture Club, Bananarama and The Smiths. Thank you, the UK, very much! He also suggested that their unfamiliar British audience could search the Internet for more information. The ceremony was deliberately staged, with an emphasis on live performances. Roger Daltrey described the Brit Awards as a party, and that is history. Previous ceremonies were indeed just for the amusement of the spectators, with banquets instead of rows of seats in the audience. Though the table remained the same, the O2 Arena was more of a performance venue than a banquet hall like the Prince\\'s Palace. This ceremony places more emphasis on the performance effect, and the connection between programs is also more compact. JLS performed the opening show, which may be the most male performers in the history of the Brit Awards opening performance. A group of dancers dressed as riot police surround five members, alluding to the recent student protests in the UK. The spicy dance accompanied by the striptease of the male dancers brought down the house with laughter. Plan B performed a medley of songs from his new album, which included a special performance of fire burning. American rapper CeeLoGreen, who won the award for \"International Best Male Artist,\" performed his hit single \"ForgetYou\" at the closing ceremony, with Paloma Faith, who was nominated for \"British Best Female Artist,\" as his collaborator. At the previous Grammy night, he just performed the song with Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow. Also performing were The Corrs, Manfred Mann’s Earth Band, Tinie Tempah, Rihanna, who won the award for “Best Female Artist International,” and Avril Lavigne and Adele, who did not receive nominations but gave great performances. Avril, Cheryl Cole, and Dizzee Rascal also served as presenters. Linden/Wen']\n"

To outsiders, Mrs. Cai is a filial daughter. In her own eyes, she was to make up for the regret of not accompanying her father during his last moments when he had a cerebral hemorrhage. When Ms. Cai was interviewed by the new Minwang website on Mother\\'s Day, she modestly said that she was not worthy of being interviewed. \"I am also a mother, and all of these are what I should do.\" Four years ago, Mrs. Cai’s mother, Xu Apou, fell ill due to a sudden cerebral hemorrhage. For the following two years, Mrs. Cai has been traveling between Huangpu District and Changning District. \"Mum, others don\\'t recognize me. Although I hired a nanny, she still only recognizes me.\" She won\\'t eat her meal if I don\\'t come. To take care of my mother, I didn\\'t go back home for nearly two years. Miss Cai sold the house on Manufacturing Bureau Road in Huangpu District two years ago for the convenience of care and exchanged it for one in Changning District. Mrs. Cai said that it now takes her only 10 minutes to travel to her mother’s home, and she stays there for about 12 hours a day. Mrs. Cai is the eldest daughter in the family. Her father passed away due to a cerebral hemorrhage 20 years ago, before which there was a new life in the Cai family. Mrs. Cai said that she felt regretful for not taking good care of her father when she gave birth to a child. Four years ago, when Mrs. Xu, her grandmother, fell ill due to a cerebral hemorrhage, and her brother was busy with work, Ms. Cai took on the responsibility of taking care of her grandmother. Xu A-pou was inconvenient in movement due to cerebral hemorrhage. According to the doctor, cerebral hemorrhage patients are very likely to develop bedsores, but Xu A-pou did not, which shows that she was well taken care of. Today, Mrs. Cai still takes care of Xu Abo every day, and Xu Abo\\'s condition is sometimes good and sometimes bad, and when she does not recognize people, she calls Mrs. Cai \"sister\". When interviewed, Mrs. Cai always joked that she was not special and was not worth interviewing. But this ordinary Shanghai woman won the praise of those around her with her ordinary power.

According to the new快报讯 (New快报讯), the reporter Huang Qiong and intern Ma Xuecan, as well as the reporters Lin Jingbiao and Li Xiang of the same organization, the man used a dedicated payment website to attract more than 4,000 members from home and abroad to make a profit of over 2 million yuan. On the afternoon of the previous day, Huang, the operator of the website, was publicly tried for the crime of profiting from the reproduction and dissemination of obscene materials at the Intermediate People\\'s Court of Jiangmen. The membership fee for the mainland members is 190 yuan per month. According to the public prosecution authority, in 2005, defendant Huang Mou wrote the \"girldv adult movie website\" web page program on his computer at home in Pengjiang District, Jiangmen City, and purchased a website domain from the \"www.namecheap.com\" website, and then rented a server on the Internet. Huang used Bit Sprite download tool (i.e., BT) to download more than 1000 pornographic movies from the “forum.fdzone.org” website, then cut the above movie files into 3600 video files, and later uploaded them to the pornographic movie website he established for users to download for a fee. In order to make huge profits, Huang Mou developed website members through a membership registration system. Huang Mou collected membership fees from mainland members through the Shenzhen NPS payment platform at 190 yuan per month, and collected membership fees from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas members through the \"VEROTEL\" payment platform at 30 US dollars per month. By the time of the incident, Huang Mou had developed a total of 4,354 network registered members (times), of which 568 members were still in use. The server was not exempt from liability abroad. Yesterday in court, Huang admitted to the charges, saying that he had previously worked in the promotion of the NPS payment platform in Shenzhen, and later found that adult films had a good market and were profitable, so he decided to get involved. After the website was established, it was not specially promoted, and most of the members joined by themselves after searching online. And the defense argued that Huang’s website was hosted in the US, and that such behavior would not be punished in the local area, so they requested leniency in the punishment. The prosecutor stated that the relevant legal provisions evaluate the severity of the crime in terms of the amount of illegal profit and the number of clicks, and that the membership belongs to which place is not a standard for distinguishing the severity of the crime. As long as the criminal behavior occurs in China, it must be punished.']\n"

She was suspected of being hacked by her boyfriend while she was unconscious. He seemed like a decent person, but I didn\\'t expect him to be so ruthless, actually chopping off my right hand. The low voice of Xiaowen was full of anger. On the noon of the previous day, Xiaowen from Huize in Qujing and her family told the journalists about Xiaowen\\'s unfortunate experience. ■ Xiao Wen, who sat on the sofa, was trying to recall what happened on the night of February 9 this year after she woke up from a coma and found her right hand missing. From 8 to 11 that evening, the boyfriend called several times to ask to see Xiaowen, who said \"I\\'m still at work\" each time. Late at night, her boyfriend suddenly came to her dormitory and forcibly dragged Xiaowen to the West Ring Bridge Scenic Observation Platform by the Guangguan River, which is 1 kilometer away. Boyfriend asked, \"Is it okay if we go home for the New Year?\" Xiaowen said, \"I won\\'t have a holiday until the New Year\\'s Eve, so I will go back after the New Year.\" The two of them sat on a big rock on the viewing platform without quarreling. After a long silence, probably around 12:30 in the early hours of the next morning, Xiaowen said, \"I\\'m going back to my accommodation!\" Get up to prepare to leave. But the boyfriend said, \"You are leaving without even saying goodbye!\" Then, to Wen Xiao’s surprise, the other party pushed her down a stone slope more than one meter high, causing her to hit her left occipital against the stone and pass out. When Xiaowen woke up, she saw the police and the 120 doctors by her side. At that time, I immediately felt a sharp pain in my right hand. It was only when someone else reminded me that I realized my entire right hand was gone. Brother didn\\'t find his sister\\'s hand. Brother said, \"We only found out that my sister had an accident that night when the police called us.\" When we arrived at the entrance of Yunnan United Hospital at 1:30 in the morning, my sister, who was covered in blood, was sleeping on the ambulance, but her wounds were terrible to look at. Then, the sister was transferred to the Third People\\'s Hospital of Yunnan Province for treatment, and she stayed there until she was discharged on February 24. Looking at his sister\\'s right hand, the elder brother was very sad, \"The bones were all broken. That night, I drove to the West Ring scenic spot and turned on the car lights to look for the police for half an hour. There was only a large pool of blood at the scene, but I did not find my sister\\'s right hand. We also guessed whether he (his sister\\'s boyfriend) had thrown his sister into the river or taken her away? After the incident, his phone was unreachable, and there was no trace of him in his hometown. Brother Xiaowen said that the police of Donglu Bridge Police Station, Xishan Branch of Kunming Public Security Bureau came to the hospital for an inquiry with his sister at 4 p.m. on February 10. Last week, he went to the police station to inquire about the progress of the case. The police replied that no trace of the suspect had been found and that they were still searching. Family members are looking forward to the police solving the case as soon as possible. Xiao Wen\\'s family said, \"Since he has done something, he should face reality, dare to take responsibility for the consequences and responsibilities caused by himself, how can he run away!\" After the incident, Xiao Wen\\'s brother quickly made copies of the cruel man\\'s photo and distributed them to relatives and friends, asking for help in finding him. Hope the police can catch the murderer and bring him to justice as soon as possible! Said Xiao Wen\\'s big brother. Yesterday, the reporters called the Dongluqiao Police Station of Xishan Public Security Bureau to inquire about the case. The police officer replied that the case was indeed there, but the case was still under further investigation. ■Recalling the matchmaker who introduced her boyfriend, Xiao Wen and her family told the reporter that Xiao Wen and her boyfriend met through a matchmaking service. To her parents and brother, Xiaowen is a gentle girl. After the Lantern Festival last year, Xiaowen, who was at the age of marriage, expressed for the first time that she was willing to date. On the afternoon of the sixteenth day of the first lunar month, the matchmaker led a young man to her home. At the first meeting, Xiaowen and his parents had their first impression of the boy who spoke little to them: honest and down-to-earth. Then, after the parents accepted the thin gifts of wine and tea that the other party brought, they agreed that the two could date. The parents said to their daughter, \"Do as you feel like, we will follow your will completely.\" Xiaowen was a little shy and nodded. Since then, the two have been dating. The man was very proactive, calling Xiao Wen frequently. Dislike her boyfriend urging to get married frequently. Last February, Xiaowen and her boyfriend came to Kunming to work. Her boyfriend was driving for someone else, while Xiaowen worked as a waiter in a restaurant. Since the two people live quite far apart, on weekends, it is often the boyfriend who comes to the restaurant to meet Xiaowen. Besides eating something together outside, the boyfriend did not say much. As time went by, it might be that the boyfriend thought it was time to talk about marriage, and his parents went to Xiao Wen\\'s home to discuss marriage matters, but Xiao Wen\\'s parents still insisted on respecting their daughter\\'s opinion. Unexpectedly, after that, her boyfriend brought up the same question every time they met, which made Xiaowen increasingly annoyed. The ex-boyfriend asked Xiaowen to meet him one evening in August last year and urged her to get married again. This time, Xiaowen thought and thought, and finally said, \"We are not suitable for each other, let\\'s break up!\" After a moment of silence, his boyfriend said, \"I disagree!\" What are the problems I can correct. They did not see eye to eye and parted ways unhappily that night. Until January this year, when Wenwen\\'s chances of getting in touch with him and answering his calls were getting fewer and fewer, the man still said to Wenwen, \"Let\\'s get back together and continue to be together!\" And told Xiaowen to go home for the New Year together, and after the New Year, get married, but was rejected by Xiaowen. Xiaowen said, \"If we continue to be together, I won\\'t be happy, and I won\\'t be happy in the future either. Let\\'s break up.\" Hearing this reply, the boyfriend just sighed repeatedly. □ Chief Reporter Lü Shicheng (Chuncheng Evening News)']\n"

Sina提示：This article belongs to the research report column, which is only the personal opinion and view of an analyst on a stock, and is not a formal news report. Sina does not guarantee its authenticity and objectivity. All relevant information about the stock, as announced by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, should be referred to, and investors are advised to pay attention to the risks.  Orient Securities Xu Jianhua, Zhang Lei, Yang Baofeng\\'s mid-term performance has declined significantly year-on-year, and the stock price has already reflected this in advance. EPS for the first half of the year was 0.013 yuan, down 81.4% year-on-year, mainly due to the slow recovery process of the domestic titanium industry, which is still in the bottom, and the company\\'s product sales structure has not improved significantly, and the product sales are still concentrated in the consumer goods market with lower gross profit margin. Recent stock price movements have fully reflected the pressure of significantly lower earnings. Since June, the company\\'s stock price has lagged the market by 30%, reflecting the twists and turns of the industry\\'s recovery from the bottom and the expectation of a significant decline in the mid-year report. The overseas titanium market is recovering strongly, and it is expected that the company\\'s export orders for aerospace titanium materials will gradually recover from the second half of the year. A series of announcements from Boeing this year have shown a strong recovery in the titanium industry - such as the successful maiden flight of the Dreamliner 787, the expected delivery at the end of the year, and three consecutive announcements in the past four months to accelerate production of multiple models of its aircraft in the next two years. We believe that the export of the company\\'s aerospace titanium materials will soon recover as the overseas titanium market continues to recover. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, the demand of China\\'s titanium industry will enter a new era of explosive growth, and the company, as the leader of the domestic titanium material industry, will fully benefit. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, the demand for titanium in China’s national economy, including aerospace, shipbuilding and offshore oil and gas extraction, as well as medical and sports leisure, will enter a new development period. The large aircraft project, Chang\\'e program, aircraft carrier and new generation fighter, marine engineering, nuclear power plant plan and other projects will gradually enter the period of explosive growth in the demand for titanium materials. As the leading player in the domestic titanium industry, the company should fully benefit. Upgrade to Buy rating. Based on the prediction of the price of sponge titanium per ton at 60,000, 80,000 and 100,000 yuan per ton in 2010-2012, the EPS in 2010-2012 are 0.19 yuan, 0.69 yuan and 1.31 yuan respectively. We maintain our profit forecast unchanged and upgrade our rating to \"Buy\" with a target price of 33 yuan. There are two main reasons: one is the valuation advantage. Recent sharp declines in stock prices have led to a current PB ratio of only 2.4 times, ranking third from the bottom among more than 60 metal and non-metal companies listed in China, and also at a low valuation range in the company\\'s historical valuation. We believe that such a low PB ratio has already fully reflected the expectation of a depressed industry. The export of aviation titanium materials by the Second Company is expected to recover soon, mainly benefiting from the strong recovery of the overseas aviation industry. Over the long and medium term, looking at 12-18 months, we believe that once the domestic titanium industry experiences a strong recovery, referring to the PB operation path of international titanium giants TIE and RTI, Baotie\\'s PB is also expected to return to the level before the financial crisis in the first half of 2008, that is, around 4 times.']\n"

      "['娄先生,钱先生,伍先生,吕老师', '正向', 'Opinion: Whether to Grade Students\\' Winter Vacation Homework: Parents and Teachers Have Their Own Reasons. On the 21st, many middle and primary school students returned to school and submitted their winter vacation homework. Some parents have reported that teachers often do not correct the homework submitted by students, and this phenomenon of \"doing without correcting\" is irresponsible towards the children. Some teachers believe that the original intention of holiday homework is to help children review the knowledge points, and there is no need to correct all of them. Should winter vacation homework be corrected? Parents and teachers have their own reasons. Parent: How can we know the effect without correction? The winter vacation homework is also one of the normal teaching links, and the teacher has the responsibility to monitor it. Mr. Lou, a parent, believes that the role of winter vacation homework is to help children review and learn new things, and not to forget the \"learning state\" in the fun of the holiday. Since the teacher has assigned homework, how the child completes it must be monitored through grading, otherwise the purpose of the homework will be lost. Mr. Qian, the parent, believes that not correcting the winter vacation homework by the teacher may demotivate the child\\'s enthusiasm for learning. Mr. Qian\\'s daughter has always been very serious since she was young, and she did not miss a single diary during the winter vacation, and The Winter Vacation Life was done with great care. Now, in the evaluation of primary and secondary school studies, there is a daily study attitude, and if the teacher is serious about correcting the winter vacation homework, at least it can show the child\\'s attitude towards learning. But if the teacher does not approve, the child’s efforts will not be recognized. Some children who are a bit playful lack self-control and need their parents to supervise them to do their homework every day. Will these children finish their winter vacation homework seriously next year if they know that the teacher does not attach importance to it and does not even correct it? Wouldn\\'t this create a vicious cycle of teachers catering to students and students catering to teachers? Mr. Wu, the parent, also proposed that correcting homework is not only an understanding of students\\' learning effects, but also a feedback on teachers\\' teaching. Only by grading homework can we find out where the difficulties lie and what problems are common to the whole class and need to be adjusted in teaching. Teachers: Children\\'s \"self-inspection\" is helpful for self-management, but some teachers believe that it is neither time-efficient nor necessary to correct all the winter vacation homework. Some homework can be \"self-inspected\", and teachers can choose to correct the winter vacation homework without affecting the feedback effect. A primary school Chinese language teacher revealed that the school started after the Spring Festival this year, and the preparation time for lessons was very tight. She has two classes with 70 students. If she were to correct all of the Winter Vacation Life, weekly essays, and reading notes, it would take at least two weeks, and feedback would be too late by then. Thus, the routine approach is to only correct important assignments, such as reading notes, carefully correcting them book by book, and providing timely feedback to students. This is both efficient and helps understand the effectiveness and feedback of the winter vacation homework. A large number of simple, mechanically copied questions, without teachers\\' correction, do not affect the feedback effect. Teacher Lu from the Experimental Demonstration High School in the city believes that \"Winter Vacation Life\" is to enable students to \"review old knowledge and gain new insights\", and the correct answers are attached at the back. Children can check them themselves or ask their parents for some guidance. And The Winter Vacation Life is too simple, and even if the teacher corrects it, few valuable problems can be found. It is better to \"delegate\" the students to self-examine or peer-examine, which is more conducive to cultivating their initiative. Some teachers also believe that reading notes, field trips, and other activities are meant to encourage children to read quietly or participate in practice. Regardless of the quality of the reading notes or practice reports, children will gain something from this experience. Why do teachers need to check and correct them?']\n"

      "['刘女士,李玉刚,路成,路成正,张建军,甘琼芳,郑蕊', '正向', 'The young man, to relieve stress, put on female makeup at night and went out, claiming that he would never change his gender. In the evening, a man walked into a barber shop on Taihu Road. Boss, it\\'s still the same as before. Miss Liu nodded in understanding and took out a bottle of astringent water, carefully applying it to the man\\'s face. After 10 minutes, Miss Liu began to remove the astringent water that had solidified on the man\\'s face, and then applied foundation, blush, drew eyebrows, and applied false eyelashes. She then carefully applied eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick. The man took out a black and silky wig and asked Miss Liu to help him put it on. Then he went into the next small room to change clothes. 20 minutes later, a fashionable \"girl\" with long hair, wearing a red short coat, black mini skirt, black stockings, and black short boots, and carrying a pink bag, walked out of the hair salon. Li Yuguang made him fall in love with the feeling of \"cross-dressing\". The man\\'s name is Lu Cheng (a pseudonym), 25 years old, from Hefei. On the evening of January 14, he appeared on the cold street of Hefei in a fashionable women\\'s outfit. Lu Cheng said, \"I went to the barber shop specially, their professional effect will be much better, usually I do it myself, and it can be done in half an hour.\" “Lu Cheng” started to “transform” because of a chance opportunity, he saw Li Yuguang wearing women\\'s clothes on TV, and felt very \"stunning\", \"too beautiful, I feel very artistic.\" At that time, Lu Chengzheng and his ex-girlfriend were in a sweet period. When his girlfriend was not around, he would secretly try on his girlfriend\\'s clothes and shoes. Later, he also developed an interest in his girlfriend\\'s cosmetics and handbags. After his girlfriend learned of his hobbies, she did not strongly stop him, but only told him not to play too much, so he later dared to wear women\\'s clothes in front of his girlfriend, even put on makeup as a girl and went out shopping with his girlfriend at night. Back then, I would only wear it occasionally, just because I thought it looked good and it was fun to wear. Lu Cheng told the reporter. He said that he wore women\\'s clothes just to relieve stress. In 2007, Lu Cheng found a job in a restaurant and began a life as an ordinary worker. However, the long-term hard work and monotonous lifestyle gradually made him feel bored. With his loneliness and depression having nowhere to vent, he could only pass the limited leisure time by going online. Over time, Lu Cheng discovered a special group on the Internet. They were all young men who liked to wear men\\'s clothing during the day and appear as women at night. Lu Cheng felt he had found an \"organization\", and later he found his current roommate in this group, and the two became good friends. Now, Lu Cheng has added people in Hefei who have similar hobbies into a QQ group, and he is the group owner, while his roommate is the administrator. Work, life, and family pressures are too great. Maybe everyone has different ways to relieve stress. We choose to relieve stress by wearing women\\'s clothes, and we can also show our beauty. Why not? Lu Cheng, who is 168 cm tall and weighs 104 pounds, is quite proud of the fact that she has a feminine figure when walking on the street. On the evening of the 14th, the reporter and Lu Cheng walked into several jewelry stores and clothing stores together, and none of the bosses recognized that he was a man. One boss even tried to sell him women\\'s cosmetics with great enthusiasm. His dream is to become a tour guide, he graduated from a tourism school, and being a tour guide has always been his dream. But when he graduated, his father just happened to pass away, and it was not easy to find a job as a tour guide. Under the pressure of reality, he went to work in a hotel. In the second half of 2008, he met his ex-girlfriend, but they eventually broke up. I am planning to resign next year. Lu Cheng said that he wanted to strive in the direction of the tour guide. He is now working hard to save money to fight for the future. When it comes to the perfect girl in his heart, Lu Cheng said that there were no special requirements, \"Just understand me and be able to get along with others.\" He said he was a real man and would never change his sexual orientation. I fully and unhesitatingly identified with my own masculinity. When Lu Cheng talked about the recent case of Zhuo Sister in Hefei who underwent a sex change operation, he said that he could understand their desire to become a woman, but he would not follow the trend. Lu Cheng said that he wore women\\'s clothes and made up purely for fun and to relieve stress, and he would never do a sex change operation. After finding a new girlfriend, he would no longer wear women\\'s clothes, \"because he had to consider her feelings.\" A man must take responsibility for his own actions. Lu Cheng has two brothers and two sisters, who are all married and have established their careers. After the father\\'s death, there was only a mother in her sixties at home. Every year during the Spring Festival, I go back to spend it with my mother. Buying New Year\\'s goods and making the New Year\\'s Eve dinner are my responsibilities. Psychologists: There should be proper ways to relieve stress. This kind of stress relief is not yet recognized by society, and it is easy to cause mental illness after a long time. For those like Lu Cheng who have a “cross-dressing” hobby, Zhang Jianjun, a psychological counselor from Hefei New Health Vocational Training School, told reporters that everyone who has a unique hobby initially tries to experience some behavior that is not recognized by society out of a sense of curiosity. After a long time, they become addicted and the strong social exclusion makes them feel depressed all the time. If this depression cannot be properly released, it often causes psychological problems for the person involved. Like Lu Cheng, who has had the experience of wearing women\\'s clothes for two or three years, it is a symptom of transvestism, an incorrect way to relieve stress.

      "['奥尼尔,鲨鱼,乔丹,沙克,贾巴尔,张伯伦,纳什,小斯,希尔,斯蒂夫·科尔,马里昂,丹东尼,多兰', '正向', 'O\\'Neal\\'s fighting spirit is shaken, and the countdown to retirement is in progress. The Shark is indifferent to the data in Phoenix, the desert and the heat are not to the Shark\\'s taste. But soon, Shaq could freely choose his life. On Wednesday of last week, he listed his retirement timetable in an interview with WFLA Channel 13, which is to end with the conclusion of the 2009-2010 season. By then, the five-year, $100 million contract he signed with the Heat would have expired. Shaq spoke with a light tone, imagining the pleasant life in two years: police stories, rap music, and no longer worrying about calories when choosing meals. But for Shaq, the next two years would be filled with failure and old age, and for the audience, watching the \"shark\" who has shaken the league for nearly 20 years grow old day by day, it was hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia. Without desire to return, the host of channel 13\\'s interview with Shaq did not expect to get this, because before this, O\\'Neal had never revealed his retirement plan - if there was, it was just a bluff, \"I will play until 40, like Jabbar.\" But in fact, he is more like Chamberlain, 36-year-old Chamberlain, whose average score dropped from 20.7 points last year to 14.8 points, and chose to retire a year later; at 39, Abdul-Jabbar still contributed 23.4 points per game in the playoffs. When interviewed, Shaq was unusually relaxed, and seemed to be full of hope for the future, \"Count down for me, buddy, my career is left with 735 days, and then I will be a cultivated person.\" One of my choices after retirement is to work in the implementation of the law, becoming a law enforcement officer, preferably a police officer. For Shaq\\'s remarks, the Suns\\' upper echelons made no response. The Nash and Stoudemire’s showboating and Hill’s injury and ticket promotions filled the official website, but there was no report of Shaq’s retirement. The local East Valley Tribune and Arizona Republic did not have the usual high talk of the general manager Steve Kerr. Common sense analysis, if Shaq speaks out, it will be a big news even in the entire league, but the Suns choose to avoid it intentionally or unintentionally, which may indicate their inner unease. At the beginning of the year, trading Marion, who was in his prime, for the aging O\\'Neal was considered a豪赌by the Suns to win the championship. The Suns were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Spurs with a score of 4-1, and then the head coach Dantoni went to New York, which meant that this gamble was almost over. Now that Shaq has early on listed his retirement timetable, he has undoubtedly sent out another negative signal – the “shark” who is old and unwilling to play can no longer be a pillar of support as before. For Shaq himself, he had a clear view of his future with the Suns. If he can maintain his performance from last season in the next two years, the Suns will still find it difficult to bring him a fifth championship ring in the West, where the competition is fierce, because his teammates, Hill and Nash, are not much younger than him. Of course, Shaq could also be traded – the question is who would be willing to take on his salary of over 20 million US dollars? The Suns could also consider buying out Shaq, but the problem is that this team’s owner is not as rich as Dolan of the Knicks. Once in contention with Jordan, on April 27, in the fourth game of the playoffs between the Spurs and the Suns, the latter won the only victory of the series after a hard-fought battle at home. The victory was just about face for the Suns, but it had a different significance for Shaq. With this victory, \"Shark\" tied Jordan\\'s playoff wins at 124; his total playoff points to date stand at 5,121, making him the third all-time playoff scorer to surpass 5,000 points, after Kareem and Jordan. Shaq not only put his name alongside Jordan in many statistical categories, but he was also the first person to truly defeat Jordan after he ascended to the pantheon (in 1991, when Jordan won the championship). The playoffs of the 1994-1995 season, although the Magic won the best record in the East with 57 wins and 25 losses in the regular season, the real protagonist could only be Jordan\\'s return and his Bulls. In the first round, defeating the Celtics, Shaq finally met Jordan, \"I finally had the chance to see how great the legendary man was.\" Both sides are level after the first four games. In the fifth game, the “sharks” continued to control the game on both ends of the court, with 23 points and 22 rebounds, 14 of which were offensive rebounds, setting a record for the highest number of offensive rebounds in the regular season of the playoffs, and also had 5 blocks, including two to Jordan. Magic won the \"Game 5\" and then won the series in the following game. Since 1991, Jordan has lost only once in the playoffs, and if you count fun stories, Shaq is the only super center to beat the \"Airman\". Now, the only remaining super center in this league is also muttering about going home, although there are still two years to go, and the era of Shaq has ended in an inescapable way.

      "['王奉春,李东岩,李领队,周妍,岳清爽', '正向', 'The leader: Wang Fengchun said inappropriate words, and the \"punishment\" was not rare. On March 5, the captain of the Chinese men\\'s curling team, Wang Fengchun, appeared in Beijing and participated in the celebration and commendation evening party held by the General Administration of Sport for the Vancouver Winter Olympic athletes. Wang Fengchun was informed that he was to temporarily leave the team on the night of March 2 when he returned to Beijing from Vancouver, and he took a train back to Harbin that night. What was the reason that Li Dongyan, the captain of the Chinese curling team, punished Wang Fengchun in such a way? What was Li Dongyan\\'s purpose in \"adjusting the team\" at a time when everyone was happy? On March 6, the reporter interviewed Li Dongyan on the above issues. Li Dongyan talked about Wang Fengchun\\'s \"adjustment\". Journalist: Do you know the reason why Wang Fengchun was adjusted? Li Dongyan: Wang Fengchun\\'s adjustment is just a normal personnel adjustment of the team, and we hope that this player can return to think calmly. Is it because of his poor performance in the Winter Olympics? Li Dongyan: I don\\'t think there is any problem with the performance of the Winter Olympics. The players have already done their best. The men\\'s team has achieved such results for the first time in the Winter Olympics, showing such a level and ability. I don\\'t think there is any problem. As for Wang Fengchun, he did not perform at his best. Starting from the 8th game, we substituted Wang Fengchun with an assistant coach. But Wang Fengchun was obviously not adjusted because of his performance on the field. The reporter asked, what was the real reason for Wang Fengchun\\'s adjustment? Li Dongyan: It must be the impact on emotions. He did not play in the last two matches, which made him a little unhappy, and he said some inappropriate words in some situations. For several days after the competition, he was in low spirits, and his mood affected the other team members who lived together.  Curling is a team event, we come to win, not to consider anyone\\'s face. As the team captain, he should think more about the whole team. The reporter: Let him go straight home on the day he returns, which seems a bit cruel. Li Dongyan: This is also something that happened by chance. In Vancouver, we made the decision that Wang Fengchun would go home to adjust for a few days after returning to China. He returned a bit late that day, and it was already 7:20 p.m. when he arrived at the Capital Gymnasium. Actually, having a meal was nothing, but his train left at 9 p.m. We certainly couldn\\'t delay the train because of this meal, so we talked to him. As we didn\\'t know in advance, Wang Fengchun couldn\\'t accept it. The reporter asked, why was Wang Fengchun invited to the celebratory dinner on the 5th? Li Dongyan: Merit is merit, and demerit is demerit. Wang Fengchun was one of the members of the Chinese men’s curling team who participated in the Vancouver Winter Olympics. Since the victory banquet was held to honor the members of the delegation who made contributions to the Winter Olympics, Wang Fengchun of course should have attended. The reporter: Does this mean that he has returned to the team and may participate in the upcoming World Cup? Li Dongyan: It mainly depends on his own performance. When he can return to the national team depends entirely on his own performance. I really don\\'t want any of the players to be punished after putting in so many years. But strict management, which can be said to be one of the important reasons for our team to reach this point in seven years, I think that without such strict management, the team would not have such combat power. Li Dongyan, the captain of the Chinese curling team, said so. Li Dongyan has an indescribable feeling for Wang Fengchun and the Chinese men\\'s curling team. Compared to the women\\'s team, I have to spend more time and energy on the men\\'s curling team. If I had chosen to give up instead of taking them to the competition and training, spending a lot of time on them, especially Wang Fengchun, after they failed to qualify for the World Championship in 2007. They would never have made it to today, to the Olympic stage. Li Dongyan said. Li Dongyan was also very sad about the adjustment decision made for Wang Fengchun. As the team leader, the handling of Wang Fengchun was unavoidable and a matter of making things right for others. This is a category of team management. Seven years of hardship, \"strict\" first of all. In 2003, the Chinese curling team was established, and from that day on, Li Dongyan began to devote all his strength to the curling project. For management, his attitude was firm, and he never made any difference because a player was a key player or because of the closeness of the relationship. Let us take this opportunity to follow Li, the leader, to get to know the life of curling players. First of all, strictly control the schedule. Li Dongyan introduced that the team has a detailed schedule for rest and activities, including specific times for getting up, morning exercises, meals, and going to bed. Next, collect computers and mobile phones. Given the characteristics of curling, the team members need more time to communicate and integrate, and the Chinese curling team has also adopted the practice of confiscating computers and mobile phones. We found that after training, the players held the computer in their hands every day, which is not a good thing. Because of the computer, people can play games and watch movies, but the communication between team members has decreased. So the team established a policy of collecting computers, which were only issued to team members for a short period of time at certain times. So is the mobile phone. Since the summer training, the team has been confiscating mobile phones before lights out, on the one hand, to ensure that everyone is not affected by the outside world, and on the other hand, to avoid affecting the rest of other players. Li Dongyan explained. Considering the characteristics of curling, the team will also cultivate the sense of responsibility of the players according to their different positions in training and daily life, such as what should the first thrower do? What does the second baseman do? What do third base and fourth base do? What do substitutes do? Everyone is clear about their roles and responsibilities. The seemingly harsh regulations were readily accepted by everyone in the team. The reason is simple, because everyone knows what is most important to themselves. Disciplinary actions are not uncommon, Li Dongyan said. The adjustment of Wang Fengchun is not the first case in the curling team. Such disciplinary actions have also occurred before. Girls like to go shopping, and the first thing they think of when they get to a new place is to go shopping. I think this is not a good thing, easy to distract attention and divert the line of sight. Li Dongyan said that later he really took the measure of punishing the girls by taking them to a huge shopping mall and limiting them to two hours, allowing them to browse freely, but not allowing anyone to bring a wallet. One month before the 2008 World Championship, Li Dongyan, who found that someone in the team was playing a bad role, temporarily adjusted the personnel, and Li Dongyan himself, who had no choice of other personnel, signed up to be a substitute player. Compared with European and North American countries, our players are somewhat lacking. For example, in terms of preparation, other players will clearly know what to do and what to do. But our players clearly do not understand, and do not know how to prepare. The team manager also needs to give them homework, which is really tiring. Li Dongyan said. Li Dongyan, who is ten years older than the team members, did not integrate with the team members but deliberately created a sense of distance to facilitate team management. In addition to learning to play curling in 2005, Li Dongyan\\'s training level is not inferior to that of any team member, and he has even beaten team members in team matches. For Zhou Yan, Yue Qingshuang, and other team members, he has given some instructive suggestions. Though I did not play in the 2008 World Championship, I was involved in a lot of it. I discussed strategies with the team and came up with many ideas, and in the end, we finished fourth. I felt very satisfied. Li Dongyan said.']\n"

      "['史蒂芬-埃洛普,埃洛普,多杰', '正向', \"US stock market commentary: Nokia's bet: Introduction: On February 11, Nokia officially announced a global strategic partnership with Microsoft, and the two sides will cooperate deeply in the field of smartphones. The Financial Times, in a commentary published on February 13, commented on Nokia’s strategic alliance with Microsoft, arguing that Nokia needs to rely on Microsoft’s mobile phone system to regain market share from Apple and Android phones. The following is the translation of the review article: Last week, Nokia and Microsoft announced that they would cooperate in mobile phones. Business alliances have historically had a poor track record, which may explain investors' disappointment with this collaboration. Nokia hopes to compete with Google's Android and Apple's iOS systems using Microsoft's WindowsPhone system. Nokia is not the only company facing strategic issues. Although Apple’s software and hardware have been on the rise, Microsoft’s dominance in the personal computer operating system market has never been challenged. However, Microsoft’s shift of market clout to mobile phones was not successful. Stephen Elop, who was a former Microsoft executive and is now the CEO of Nokia, said that Nokia was facing a “burning stage” before the two companies announced their cooperation last week. He believes that Nokia is under pressure from cheap phones and other smartphones produced by Chinese phone makers. Nokia's troubles are not limited to this. Even in the smartphone market, the Symbian platform, which is about to be phased out by Nokia, is in an awkward position, surrounded by iOS and Android. Consumers do not crave Symbian as much as they crave iOS, and Symbian also lacks the open source code of Android. Elop relied on mobile operators, which found that their control over the phones they sold was squeezed by Apple and Android. They want to see the emergence of a third smartphone competitor so that they can bargain over the price and features of the phone with the phone supplier. On paper, Nokia and Microsoft's strategic partnership does make sense. Setting aside other issues, both companies have vast resources and are determined to retaliate. One of the reasons for Nokia's share price drop last Friday was its refusal to reduce its investment in R&D. But the problem is that what looks consistent on a slide cannot be achieved in reality. The reason why large companies find it difficult to cooperate is that they each have their own fields. Nokia will focus more on this cooperation, while Microsoft will sell the WindowPhone system to other mobile phone manufacturers. There are many collaborations in the aviation and automotive industries, as it is difficult to convince the government to make a full acquisition. However, business cooperation is still not the preferred option, as it is difficult to decide which company should control what, and how the two companies should cooperate. As the company president said, Nokia hopes that this cooperation will bring about the expected results. Nokia must hope that the history of the business alliance will not be repeated on them.

Bologna vs. Napoli, recommend 10. European average odds: 2.82-3.06-2.49. Based on Bologna's strength, the recent good performance indicates that the team's condition is worthy of praise. After reversing Genoa 4:3 at home last round, the team has already escaped from the relegation zone, but the team's condition is not easy to maintain. Napoli, although it drew 2:2 at home against Rome in the last match, the team's recent attack is still weak, and the defense is still not reassuring. If it can be effectively solved in this match, a win is not impossible. The Asian Handicap is set at +0.5. We prefer 1, and 0 is the second choice. 2 Siena vs. Parma, recommend 31, European average odds: 2.20-3.11-3.25. Siena won 2 and drew 1 in their previous 3 matches, and there is still a chance of survival. From the performance of their home games in the last few rounds, they still have some fighting spirit. After Parmal won 1-0 against Sampdoria in the last match, they ended their 9-match league unbeaten, but this still cannot cover up the problem of unstable defense. The lower water level in the half/one goal opening of the Asian handicap indicates an upward trend, reflecting a high possibility of a draw in this round. The first choice is 1, and the second choice is 3. 3. Barry vs. Chievo, recommend 31, European average odds: 2.00-3.18-3.71. Barry experienced the fierce at the beginning of the season, and gradually returned to normal in the last few rounds. In the last round, they lost 4-0 to Catania. In this round, they will play at home against Chievo and can't afford to lose. Chievo won two consecutive matches after defeating Cagliari 2-1 in the previous round, and the team's performance was not bad, but it was difficult to do something in the home of Bari due to factors such as overall strength. The Asian Handicap went from a half ball with high water to a half/one ball with low water after the current bet, and Bari is expected to bounce back. 4. Palermo vs Livorno, recommend 3, European average odds: 1.50-3.75-6.79. After beating Juventus at home last round, Palermo is now in the fourth place in the league. The home field has not been lost this season, and the wing attack system is becoming more and more mature, making it difficult for Livorno to win. Livorno's defenders Mollo and Rivas are suspended, and the defense is incomplete. In addition, they are playing away. The Asian handicap of one goal with medium water has no悬念suspense in the win or loss. 5. Atalanta vs Udinese, recommend 30. European average odds: 2.29-3.10-3.09. The Eagles' front line, after a 3:0 victory over Lazio, fell silent, and the defense was unstable, directly leading to a decline in recent results. In this round, facing the most direct promotion opponent, they cannot afford to be careless. The roosters have achieved certain results this season through counter-attack tactics, but the absence of Dinatale casts a shadow on this round of away games. The upper limit of the level/half ball with high water is expected to see the two teams win or lose. 6, Cagliari vs Catania, recommend 31, European average odds: 1.98-3.18-3.81. After being overturned by Cittadella in the last away game, Cagliari suffered two consecutive defeats, and the team's ranking had slightly declined. However, Cagliari's home team had a record of 7 wins and 3 draws in the previous 10 rounds, which was considered a devil. In this round, facing Catania, which always counterattacks in the away game, as long as the guest team focuses on defense, the hope of winning is very faint. The half ball with high water in the Asian handicap, prefer 1, second 3. 7, Inter VS Genoa recommendation 3 European average odds: 1.40-4.18-7.88. After Inter beat the good home team Crotone 3-2 at home in the previous round, they are only 4 points behind Milan, who are second. At home this round, they will not miss any opportunity to get points at home to consolidate their position at the top. After Genoa was overturned at home in the previous round by Bologna, its morale was somewhat affected, and the factors of away match and stable ranking in the middle of the league raised doubts about its fighting spirit in this round. The Asian Handicap went from a 1/1.5 goal with high water to a 1 goal with low water after the current bet, the reduction in the handicap and the reduction in the water level, and winning for Inter is not a problem. 8 Sampdoria vs Lazio, recommend 3, European average odds: 2.07-3.14-3.55. After Sampdoria lost 1-0 to Parma in the previous round, the team ended its 6-game unbeaten streak, and in this round, they will face the Blue Eagles. Sampdoria urgently needs 3 points to challenge the top four positions. In this round, forward Paolini and Pozzi returned to the team, which will greatly enhance the team's attacking strength. As for Lazio, after the final whistle of the last match, they let Fiorentina equalize and lost the three points they had in hand. Now the team is fighting for survival. In this match, the lower water in the half/one goal handicap of the Asian handicap suggests that Sampdoria will definitely win. 9. Bilbao vs Valadolid, recommend 30. European average odds: 1.73-3.46-4.66. The home of Bilbao Athletic has always been strong, and it has achieved a 4-game winning streak before. Such a home is difficult for Valadolid, which is struggling to stay in the league, to overcome. The half ball opening with low water on the main team is very optimistic, but be careful of Valladolid's rebound. 10. Mallorca vs. Xianghong, recommend 3, European average odds: 1.73-3.44-4.64. Malaga's form has been up and down recently, and after a tough win over Valladolid, they barely made it into the top five of the league. In this round, they will face Xianghong at home, which has a good record in the league (6 wins and 1 loss in 7 rounds). The Asian handicap opened with a half ball and low water, and Malaga's home advantage is favored. After Xianghong won 3-2 against Osasuna in the previous round, the team has been unbeaten in 3 rounds and is far away from the relegation zone. The possibility of giving up in this round is relatively large. 11. Malaga vs. Serez, recommend 31. European average odds: 1.61-3.57-5.51. Malaga lost only to Real Madrid and Barcelona in their last 8 league games. It is clear that the team has an advantage when playing against weaker teams. Sarri's relegation trend this season is obvious, and the record of no away win in this season's league will not be broken by Malaga. The Asian Handicap was set at half/one with low water, and I don't have high hopes for Sarees. 12. Zaragoza vs. Atlético, recommend 30. European average odds: 2.54-3.23-2.62. Saragossa is attacking and neglecting defense, and the defender Pudido is suspended in this round, which undoubtedly adds to the instability of the defense that is already unstable. At present, the team is only 4 points above the relegation zone. In this round, they are playing against Atletico Madrid, who are distracted by European competitions. The Asian handicap has opened a draw with low water, and the balance of victory has already tilted towards the home team. The fighting spirit and resilience of the team after Flores took office can be seen, but the team has too much debt in the first half of the league, and they have already set their sights on the cup competition. After successfully eliminating Galatasaray, this goal was further strengthened, and at the same time, it raised questions about their motivation for this round. 13. Osasuna vs. Hetafe, recommend 31, European average odds: 2.15-3.22-3.26. After Osasuna lost at Xiangyang in the previous round, the team has not won in three consecutive matches, and the league ranking has dropped significantly. The overall performance is not good. Hercules and Osasuna are a bit like difficult brothers, both with mid-table league rankings and several consecutive losses. In this match, the Asian handicap opened with a half/one goal line at medium water, and a draw is very likely. The first choice is 1; if the final line is stable, the second choice is 3. 14. Spain VS Villarreal, recommend 10. European average odds: 2.38-3.19-2.86. The Spaniards have managed to get out of the relegation zone thanks to the 4 wins and 1 draw in the last 5 home games. After Villarreal was eliminated from the Europa League, they shifted their focus to the league. After winning 1-0 against La Coruna last round, the team is pursuing a more practical style of play to secure a place in the Europa League next season. They will certainly give their all in this away game. The first choice is 0, and the second choice is 1. Matchday 10020: 10-31-31-3-30-31-3-3-30-3-31-30-31-10(1024 tickets)\"]\n"

However, Zhu never expected that the mobile phone he found belonged to a detective from Jiading. When he sent 30 fraudulent text messages to contacts in his address book, most of the messages were actually sent to police officers in Jading Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, the journalists from Jiading police force learned that Zhu Mou did not get any money from the fraud and was arrested. I am Xu Lin (a pseudonym). I have encountered some problems in a place outside my home. Please transfer 2000 yuan to the account of Yang Wujun, account number 95599××××× at the Agricultural Bank as soon as possible. During the Spring Festival this year, colleagues of Xu Lin, a police officer from the Criminal Investigation Brigade of Jiading Public Security Bureau, received the same text message from an unknown number in succession. Xu Lin was still working overtime at the unit that day, how could he suddenly be in another place? The colleagues felt that something was amiss and called Xu Lin to inquire, and it was finally confirmed that Xu Lin had not sent this text message. However, Xu Lin was puzzled as to why the person who sent the text message knew his real name and had so many colleagues' contact information. After careful recollection, Xu Lin recalled that he had lost his mobile phone when he took a taxi last June. He immediately processed a new SIM card for his mobile phone, and the 30 relatives and friends who received the text message this time were all contacts in the original mobile phone's address book. This is most likely a case of SMS fraud! Due to his professional sensitivity, Xu Lin immediately called all his relatives, friends, and colleagues who might receive the text message to warn them not to be deceived, and then he threw himself into the investigation of the case. After investigation, Xu Lin found that Yang Wujun, the account holder of the bank, was a fictitious identity. Meanwhile, the police discovered through the bank's surveillance system that a man would check his account information at an ATM on Taiguo Road in Jiading District every day. On the afternoon of February 6, Xu Lin and his colleagues finally caught the man at the gate of a hospital on Taicheng Road after tracking and waiting. Xu Lin's lost mobile phone was seized on the spot. After interrogation, suspect Zhu Mou confessed to the criminal fact of attempting to defraud over 70,000 yuan by using Xu Lin's lost mobile phone via text message. Currently, Zhu Mou has been detained in criminal custody. (Ni Dong, reporter, Kong Wen, intern)\"]\n"

It was Zhou Xin, a household registration officer of Dunchen Police Station. Zhou Xinfeng, who apprehended the criminal barehanded, covered his chest with his hand after being stabbed by the criminal and chased the criminal for 44 meters, and died on the ground. Hero resume Zhou Xin, born on January 6, 1979, joined the public security work in August 1999, joined the party in 2002, has a bachelor\\'s degree, and is a first-level police inspector. ■Victim: A young man stabbed four people in a row on the street at 8:00 p.m. on the 20th. Guan Lingsong, the owner of the lottery ticket station at No. 46 People West Road, Fuling District, was closing the door and going home. A young man jumped down from the stairs and pressed his shoulder. He felt pricked in his left thigh, but before he could react, the man had already fled. Then he took off his pants and found a 1.5 cm long cut on his left leg. Call the police quickly! This brat has already assassinated two people. The masses shouted to Kuang. The clinic on People West Road No.16, which treated three victims, said that the first victim, Mr. Wen, was about 40 years old, and was stabbed on the side of Fuling District People\\'s Hospital Second Outpatient Department; the second victim, Mr. Zeng, was stabbed in front of a tobacco store on People West Road; the injured parts of Wen and Zeng were both thighs, and the wounds were all 1.5 cm long and about 1.5 cm deep. Journalists learned that the three victims were stabbed within less than five minutes. After debridement and bandaging, the three people are out of danger. The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported yesterday that the criminal had stabbed another pedestrian in the street before. ■ Eyewitness: The injured police officer chased the criminal for 44 meters. Ms. Zhong, an eyewitness, said that after the criminal stabbed Kuang Lingsong, he swung the knife and ran towards the South Gate Mountain direction along People West Road, and the crowd shouted, \"He killed someone, catch him.\" When the criminal ran to the Dunning Police Station, a thin young man in plain clothes shouted, \"Stop!\" I am a policeman! Go to grab the criminal barehanded. The robber struggled and stabbed the thin young man with the knife in a frenzy. After the struggle lasted for more than ten seconds, the thin young man covered his chest and abdomen, chased the criminal closely, and shouted, \"Catch him.\" Ms. Zhong said that after chasing the thin young man for 44 meters, he fell to the ground and never stood up again. Uniformed police officers arrived, helped up the thin young man, and shouted, \"Call an ambulance quickly, he is Zhou Xin, a police officer from our Dunren Police Station.\" It was then that Zhong realized that the thin man was Zhou Xin, the household registration officer of the Dunningren police station. At around 8 p.m. that night, Zhou Xin, who had been working overtime, left the police station to eat something and encountered the crowd shouting to catch the criminal. The police and the public sent Zhou Xin to the hospital for treatment. Due to serious injuries and excessive bleeding, Zhou Xin died after unsuccessful rescue. The doctors from the涪陵区急救中心 who participated in the rescue said that if Zhou Xin had not continued to pursue after being injured, perhaps the blood loss would not have been so much, and the chances of rescue would have been greater. ■ Manhunt: 40 minutes later, the suspect was captured after the police in Fuling quickly mobilized forces to set up a net for control. At 8:40 p.m. that night, the police arrested the suspect Shao Aojie at his home in Songcui Road, the dormitory of the Petroleum Company. Police searched Shao Aojie’s home and found a knife, which was initially confirmed to be the murder weapon used to kill the police officer and others through surveillance footage comparison. It was found that Shao Aojie is 18 years old, unemployed, and a drug user. He was caught by the police twice before, and the motive for this crime is still under further investigation. The news of Zhou Xin’s sacrifice while apprehending a criminal spread quickly throughout Fuling City. From 9 a.m. yesterday morning to around 7 p.m. last night, thousands of citizens spontaneously went to the Fuling District Funeral Home to pay their respects. Heroic Deeds to be Commemorated for First-Class Merit, and Martyr and First-Class Hero: Yesterday morning, at the request of Wang Lizhun, the Party Secretary of the Public Security Bureau, the leaders of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Huagang, Yang Zengyu, and Wang Tingyan, rushed to Fuling District to visit and comfort the relatives of Zhou Xin.

Wang Lijun clearly instructed on the follow-up work: \"We cannot let heroes bleed and cry.\" At 4 p.m. yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported to the media that Zhou Xin was awarded a First-Class Merit. The Fuling District Government said that it was actively preparing materials to apply for Zhou Xin as a revolutionary martyr. The municipal public security bureau also said that it would apply to the Ministry of Public Security for the first-class model of the police force for Zhou Xin. It was learned that the unit had previously insured Zhou Xin with Ping An Insurance Company for work-related injury accidents. Last morning, the general manager of the Chongqing Fuling branch of the insurance company, Zhong Jian, said that the 200,000 yuan work injury accidental injury insurance amount will be transferred to Zhou Xin\\'s beneficiary account the day after tomorrow. Suspect\\'s grandmother: dropped out of junior high and roamed society, stabbed others multiple times in the past. Yesterday morning, the reporter found Shao Aojie\\'s grandmother, Zhang Grandma. She said that she did not know that her grandson was taking drugs. After Shao Aojie\\'s parents divorced, they neglected to take care of him. Shao started to hang out in society since he was in Grade 8. The day before yesterday, Shao Aojie came to find her from his accommodation on Songcui Road. When she left, she sent Shao downstairs and watched him get into the car. Mrs. Zhang explained that she did so because Shao Aojie had delusions. Whenever he saw someone on the street talking on the phone or shouting for a long time, he would think that they were cursing him, and he would go to hurt them. Shao Aojie\\'s violent tendencies began last year. Zhang\\'s grandma said that he had stabbed several people with a small knife, including a resident of the surname Deng last year, and the compensation was still unpaid. As Shao Aojie\\'s parents could not be reached, his grandparents also moved out of their original residence. As of last night at 6 p.m., the reporter had not found any other relatives of Shao Aojie. In memory of heroic parents: \"I am proud of you and I am proud of you,\" in the sound of funeral music, in front of the coffin, Zhou Xin\\'s father held back tears to greet guests. He said that his son, having chosen to be a people’s police officer, should always be ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. Zhou Dad works at the Qingxi Town Police Station, and his mother runs a clinic in Jiaoshi, so they have been living apart for a long time. Zhou Xin did not receive good care when he was young. Now that she is about to retire, her son has left… Zhou Mom also chose to be strong in the face of her son\\'s departure. She said, \"Son, I won\\'t cry. I am proud of you and I am proud of you, I can\\'t cry.\" But Mrs. Zhou still cried, and her eyes were swollen. Colleague Feng Wenbo said that Zhou Xin\\'s colleague, Wu Grandma, is a lonely elderly person who is over 90 years old and it is very difficult to communicate with her. However, Zhou Xin visits Wu Grandma\\'s home every week to chat with her. When Wu Grandma meets people, she praises \"Zhou Huxing\". Feng Wenbo said that Zhou Xin seldom spoke in the office, but was very talkative when receiving the public\\'s inquiries or assistance, and was even tireless. Now, recalling, he was living up to the words he had once said, \"Do not let the police uniform down.\" \"My beloved wife is still waiting for you to have dinner,\" said Jian Zhengmin, the hero\\'s wife, who was already unable to speak clearly. She cried to the reporter about the process of meeting, falling in love with, and experiencing life with her husband. She said that in August last year, their love child, a daughter, was born, and the family began a sweet life of three. How can I explain to the little one? Didn\\'t you say you were going to teach her to sing \"Daddy\\'s Good\"? Qian Zhengmin sobbed again. Zhou Xin left home at around 7 o\\'clock that morning, saying that there were many things to do at the police station that day. That evening, at around 7:00, he still called Jian Zhengmin to say that the materials had not been organized yet, and he would come back to have dinner later, asking her not to wait. She also said, \"It\\'s the weekend, so you can wait a little longer!\" Come back early. To my surprise, it was a call from the nurse. Jian Zhengmin ran to the hospital, and his beloved was already with her eyes closed. “I am still waiting for you to have dinner…” Jian Zhengmin burst into tears again. This version of the manuscript was written by reporter Xia Xiangzou.']\n"

      "['杨威', '正向', 'Counterfeit websites are full of tricks, how to prevent fraud and fake goods during the Double Festival. As the Double Festival approaches, the booking of air tickets is becoming increasingly popular, and the sale of special air tickets is in great demand. As people use the Internet more and more, the number of fake websites that use discounted airfares to attract customers\\' attention is also increasing. Due to the low entry barrier of the Internet and the low imitation cost, fake websites are rampant in the current air ticket booking market, and some false websites even directly use special air tickets for fraud. Based on the analysis of more than 2,400 samples of online travel bookings from the Chinese Consumer Association, which conducted a nationwide survey (the survey subjects included all consumers who had participated in online travel bookings, and the survey methods included online questionnaire surveys, telephone interviews, intercept interviews, etc.) from June to August this year, 80% of the complaints were directed at black agents, unqualified agents, fake websites, phishing websites, and fake websites. With such powerful website spoofing techniques, many websites are now plagued by fake websites such as Qunar.com, the official website of China Southern Airlines (CSAIR.com), and Ctrip.com, as online travel websites gain prominence. These fake websites are so skillful in deceiving consumers that they are truly amazing. Such websites often harm consumers\\' interests due to their lack of ability to authenticate the qualifications of agents. Nevertheless, knockoffs are still knockoffs, and consumers can still spot the obvious differences if they observe and pay attention carefully. False 400 calls are not harmless. As a convenient service provided by enterprises for consumers, 400 calls have always been popular among a wide range of consumers. But, at present, scammers are using means to frequently post ads on general search websites such as Baidu, providing a 400 phone number in the ads. When consumers call this number, the fraudster often asks the consumer to transfer money to someone\\'s bank card for various reasons. Then, the 400 hotline becomes unreachable, and consumers often realize they have been cheated when they complain. Qunar.com\\'s air ticket service has no 400 hotline. According to the reporter\\'s understanding, the dedicated line of Qunar.com\\'s air ticket service is: 01058752660. Yang Wei, the senior director of Qunar\\'s Air Ticket Product Department, said that setting up a complaint hotline would make it easier for users to identify and prevent them from being cheated. So, the \"Qunar\" that provides 400 phone number ticket search is a fake. In addition, Yang Wei reminds consumers to conduct a reverse query when calling the 400 phone number of the related travel websites found by Baidu search, and return the 400 phone number to Baidu search. If the same number provides services for multiple well-known travel websites, it can be determined that the number is a scam call. Counterfeits are so powerful. How can we distinguish the real from the fake? Yang Wei reminded the general consumers to identify the true and false websites from the following methods: First, check the ICP filing, each legitimate website will have ICP filing information below, which proves the legitimacy of its website operation. Second, legitimate agents will have CATA (Civil Aviation Transport Association) certification qualifications. All agents cooperating with Qunar.com must pass the CATA certification. When users consume on other websites, they should also carefully identify whether there is a CATA certification. Third, regular agents will use third-party online payment platforms or banks for transactions. For example, Qunar website requires agents to have this capability in order to cooperate. If there are websites that require users to trade through remittance, they are fake websites. So the most direct way to prevent being cheated is to refuse to transfer money directly. The \"Gold Medal Air Ticket Service System\" helps consumers find high-quality agents. Notably, the \"Gold Medal Air Ticket Service System\" launched by Qunar website recently can help consumers distinguish the truth from falsehood, and find high-quality and reassuring agents. It is understood that the system provides four system platforms, providing air ticket guarantee services from four aspects: qualifications, services, complaint handling, and user supervision. Including: 1. 100% CATA certified agents system for validating agent qualifications on Qunar; 2. Agent complaint management system for standardizing agent management; 3. Agent information query system for querying detailed information of all agents on Qunar; 4. Consumer evaluation ranking system that incorporates user evaluation factors into search ranking results to promote agents to improve their own services. Choose service providers with legitimate qualifications, master the fraud tactics of fake agents: do not transfer money directly, do not provide account passwords on payment platforms without security guarantees, and booking air tickets during the Double Festival can be more secure.']\n"

      "['朱敏,李铎', '正向', 'Group buying still lacks industry standards in the era of burning money. With the financing of Lashou.com and Dianping.com, the group buying market has entered the era of burning money. However, the lag in service quality and the absence of industry standards will continue to force group buying websites to struggle for some time. According to the data released by the well-known domestic internet research institution CNZZ recently, the number of e-commerce industry websites in the country reached 21,700 in the first quarter of this year, up 31.16% year-on-year. Among them, the growth of group buying websites is the main component of the overall growth of e-commerce industry websites. But, the rapid growth momentum does not mask the market’s shortcomings. Since March 2010, the number of group buying websites in China has exceeded 4,000 and is growing at a rate of nearly 10 per day. Within just over a year of the development of group buying websites, due to the low construction threshold, the ability to directly bring in cash flow, and greater reliance on offline resources, a large number of small and medium-sized websites have quickly entered or transformed into the group buying field. Entering multiple fields has not helped group buying websites develop well, but instead has led to problems such as fraud, substandard quality, and poor service, making the prospects of the group buying website industry uncertain. Zhu Min, vice president of Dida Team, told the reporter that currently, China\\'s group buying websites are still in the early stage, just like a child learning to walk. During the process of growth, there will inevitably be bumps, and problems need to be continuously discovered and improved, and a strong service process guarantee system needs to be formed to make the future road of group buying websites smoother. It is understood that DiDaTuan has teamed up with YiChaYiZuo Restaurant to launch the second phase of unlimited all-you-can-eat group buying service. In addition to the \"original quality, transparent reservation, and complete menu\" of YiChaYiZuo, DiDaTuan has also made a commitment to \"commitment to quality service of all stores nationwide, and full refund service provided by DiDaTuan throughout the process\", which will comprehensively upgrade the three services. The three measures launched by Dida Team and Yichazuo in this campaign have comprehensively improved the group buying service experience, including service upgrades at all Yichazuo stores, which are fully prepared to meet the peak traffic; at the same time, the Dida Team service complaint hotline is on standby throughout, and the \"400\" hotline will be directly connected to Yichazuo customer service throughout the usage period, coordinating services nationwide; in addition, Dida Team fully supports refunds, and after the group buying is completed, if consumers are dissatisfied with the online reviews, Dida Team will provide a refund channel at any time to fully refund the cost of this group buying. Previously, the first Tida Group Buy for Tea and Seating received a warm welcome from consumers, but due to inadequate preparation in various aspects, it encountered problems such as difficulty in making reservations, insufficient preparation at the store, quality service issues, and untimely feedback on online complaints. In response to this situation, Dida Team actively collected consumer experience information, held multiple internal discussions, and had in-depth communication with Yichatizuo. They have teamed up with Yichatizuo again to launch a \"no limit, eat as much as you want\" group-buying package, not only upgrading the menu, but also significantly improving service quality.

      "['', '正向', \"China contributed 22% to global economic growth in 2008 and even more in 2009. The United Nations' 2009 World Economic Situation and Prospects, which was recently released in Beijing, pointed out that China remains the driving force for economic growth in East Asia and the global economy. However, the decline in trade with Europe and America will slow down the development of most Asian economies led by China. Therefore, China needs a new economic strategy to maintain growth. The report notes that China contributed about 22% to global growth in 2008, and may have contributed even more in 2009, as most developed economies fell into recession. But China’s growth rate has also slowed, with GDP growth falling from 11.9% in 2007 to 9.1% in 2008, but still relatively high, and expected to fall to 8% in 2009. The report projects that, if not for the sustained strong growth in domestic end-use demand, the decline could have been even greater. In the past few years, as the global economy has grown rapidly, China’s economy has been driven to a large extent by the huge demand from US consumers, which was in turn supported by easy credit conditions and rapidly rising house prices. China and other countries with growing trade surpluses have accumulated large foreign exchange reserves and are willing to purchase dollar assets, thereby providing funding for US growth in this phase. However, this global model of development cannot last. Export growth in China and other developing countries is now directly and indirectly affected by the US economic recession. The UN report notes that China has $1.9 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and a balanced government budget, with sufficient policy space to adopt more necessary expansionary financial policies to stimulate domestic demand, thereby offsetting the decline in weak exports. China has begun to exploit this policy space to launch large-scale fiscal stimulus, a move that is likely to revive global demand. China announced a fiscal stimulus package of 5860 billion US dollars (or 15% of GDP) for the period of 2009 and 2010. The stimulus package aims to strengthen domestic demand, focusing on investment in basic facilities and consumption. The targets include low-income housing, rural infrastructure, water, electricity, transportation, the environment, technological innovation, and the reconstruction of several disaster areas, especially those affected by the earthquake on May 12. The scheme also raises the incomes of the poor through a variety of measures, including higher subsidies and the higher government procurement prices for food in 2009.\"]\n"

      "['单开佳,倪韵婷', '正向', 'HTSC: Pay Attention to Growth Style Funds with Medium to High Stock Positions□HTSC (Weibo) Shan Kai Jia Ni Yunti In recent weeks, many positive factors have boosted investors\\' enthusiasm: policy substantive fine-tuning has sparked many investors\\' expectations; the decline in inflation and the decline in property prices have helped to improve policy space; liquidity is currently relatively slightly loose; overseas uncertainties have temporarily eased. But, the future market still needs a realistic data of \"economic bottoming out\" or a \"new cycle launch\" as a signal for the right-side launch, so the A-share market may be more of a fluctuating rebound. The economy is still in a downward phase, which may lead to a decline in the profitability of listed companies. Investors can pay more attention to industries that are supported by industrial policies, which may have the characteristics of both attack and defense. At the same time, some sectors that are undervalued and have fallen sharply may also have the opportunity for a rebound. These opportunities may be more concentrated in growth sectors and some consumption sectors. In such a market environment, investors can continue to buy stock hybrid funds, and actively managed funds with outstanding stock selection capabilities and higher positions may have some excess returns. Of course, investors can also participate in the rebound with the high-risk shares of stock-type leveraged funds. In terms of the general allocation of the fund, it is recommended that the style of equity mixed open-end funds be slightly biased towards growth. During the market rebound, policy-driven and valuation restoration may provide good investment opportunities. Policy-driven sectors include culture, environmental protection, water conservancy, agricultural subsidies, strategic emerging industries, etc.; valuation recovery includes some over-corrected sectors in the early stage; and the stability of earnings can be paid attention to in some consumption stocks. Analyze these sectors, more may be concentrated in some growth style stocks, so it is suggested that investors can slightly tilt towards growth when constructing a fund portfolio. From the perspective of trading-type funds, based on the historical performance, it is usually the time point for the preview of the closed-end fund dividend situation in November, corresponding to the significant narrowing of the discount of traditional closed-end funds. But since the beginning of this year, due to the overall market fluctuations and decline, the distributable profits have decreased, and the distributable profits of most fund units are below 0.1 yuan, which is significantly lower than in previous years. But we believe that the market in the fourth quarter may be in a process of oscillation. During the process of market fluctuations, if the rhythm is stepped on, the distributable income of the fund may increase to a certain extent. In addition, the current discount return income is at a high level since the beginning of the year. It is recommended that investors pay attention to funds with better stock selection ability, better ability to grasp the rhythm, and relatively higher distributable profits at the end of the third quarter. The potential for dividends of such funds may be greater. For分级 funds, in the pattern of market fluctuations, stock-type high-risk shares may have more wave-like opportunities, but since the turning point of the right-side economy and profits has not yet appeared, the market\\'s rebound still needs to be cautious, so the returns of high-risk shares need to be realized in a timely manner.

Although the discount rate may still narrow, the space for narrowing may be smaller than before. As the maturity conversion period approaches, the incentive for the discount of low-risk share classes that are about to be converted to further expand is not large, and investors can continue to hold. For index funds and ETFs, the left side of the large bottom of the market is clear, so long-term layout can still be made, and investors can use ETFs to make short-term profits in the back-and-forth oscillation. Bond markets were slightly positive in November, as the bond bear market that had lasted for a long time saw the return of the allocation value of bond funds. With the central bank\\'s open market operations, the short-term market liquidity may be slightly relaxed, so we think the returns of money market funds next month may slightly decline. But for investors with a higher demand for cash liquidity, money market funds remain the most effective tool for cash management at present. We provide asset allocation recommendations for investors with different risk tolerance, including aggressive, moderate, and conservative types, when constructing a fund portfolio. We give these three types of investors a range of allocation ratios for equity funds (including stocks, hybrid funds, and ETFs), which are 60-100% for aggressive allocation, 30-80% for stable allocation, and 10-40% for conservative allocation, with balanced allocation ratios of 80%, 55%, and 25%, respectively. When we judge that the probability of the market rising is relatively large, we will allocate a higher proportion to equity funds, and reduce the proportion otherwise. For this period, active investors are advised to allocate 75% of their assets to active stock and mixed funds, 15% to ETFs (including index funds), and 10% to bond-oriented funds. Conservative investors can allocate 55% of their assets to active stock and mixed funds, 10% to ETFs (including index funds), 20% to bond-oriented funds, and 15% to money market funds. Conservative investors can allocate 35% of their assets to active stock and mixed funds, 20% to bond-oriented funds, and 45% to money market funds.']\n"

Due to the long lack of intersection in the league trajectory of the two teams, they have only met twice in the League Cup in recent years, with each team winning one game. The average odds of 2.303.203.01 are actually favoring the Wanderers, and in the odds adjustments of mainstream companies, the home win odds of many companies have been significantly reduced after the midweek. With the away team unbeaten, it is still advisable to back the visitors at high water on half ball. 2. Cologne vs. Hoffenheim recommendation: 30. This season, Cologne's performance has always been unpredictable, with only two victories coming from away games, both of which were by a score of 4-0 or more, but they have not won a single home game, with only two goals scored in three league matches. It seems that counter-attacking is Cologne's mainstay; in the last two games, Hoffenheim, which scored 7 goals, was also prolific, and its home and away performances were more balanced. The two teams have met six times in the Bundesliga, and after winning the first three consecutive matches, Hoffenheim has not been able to take advantage of the last three matches against Cologne. Due to Cologne's performance is not stable, the average odds of 2.843.312.31 still favor the away team Hoffenheim, both teams' recent offensive power is relatively strong, and the possibility of a large score in this match is relatively large. 3.不来梅 vs Hertha BSC recommendation: 31 Hertha BSC lost the last match as the guest, which knocked the defending champion Dortmund down. However, there is no advantage in terms of past performance when challenging不来梅. They lost in the last 4 visits. This season,不来梅 started off quite well, and it seems that after completing the metabolism of the players, Coach Sha will lead不来梅 into another golden period. At present,不来梅's performance, condition, and data are all very good, so it can be seen high when they play at home against Hertha. Just the current average odds of 1.81 3.48 4.04 are somewhat misleading. Even though Hertha has maintained an unbeaten record in its first three away games, it is still a newly promoted team in the Bundesliga, and it did not significantly strengthen its team in the summer transfer window. Therefore, the second-placed不来梅only offered a half-ball low water, which is not very reasonable in terms of the odds and the spread. We must guard against a cold draw. 4. Siena vs. Lecce recommendation: Since 2002, in Serie A, Serie B and cup matches, Siena is 1-6-4 against Lecce, completely in the shadow. After the new season, the two teams ranked at the bottom of the league, and Lecce's performance in the last away match against Bologna was relatively outstanding, but the defeat at home against Atalanta showed that the performance of this team was not worthy of trust. The average odds of 1.95, 3.16, and 3.84 are more favorable for Siena, which has not won so far. After the league ended on Wednesday, most major companies significantly reduced the odds of a home win, with many companies lowering the odds of a home win from above 2.05 to below 2.00. The Asian initial handicap was half a ball with medium water, and Siena is worth a try. 5. Atlanta vs Novara Recommendation: 31 Both promotion teams have performed well, Atlanta has 7 points in 3 rounds and ranks in the front, while Novara beat Inter in the last round to win their first victory in Serie A - of course, Novara's victory was also due to the discord among the Inter staff, and Novara's victory directly led to Gasperini's final dismissal. Last season, the two teams met twice in the Lega Pro, and Atalanta was at a disadvantage with one win and one loss. Although the current points of the two teams are leading by Atalanta, in fact, since neither of the two teams introduced any stars that could significantly improve the team during the summer transfer, the two teams' strength should still be in the same level, and Atalanta's performance is very much accidental. The average odds of 1.783.264.55 are more optimistic about Atalanta, and the Asian initial disk is opened to half a point with high water, and the home team is not necessarily in control. 6. Cagliari vs Udinese recommendation: 31 After three rounds, both teams have scored 6 and 7 points respectively, and their performance is quite outstanding. Since 2000, the two teams have met 16 times in Serie A, with Udinese winning 9, drawing 3 and losing 4, clearly in the upper hand, and never losing to Cagliari in the last 5 meetings. The average odds of 2.463.112.78 are higher than those of the previous season when Udinese came to challenge, which also indicates that after the summer transfer, the strength of Udinese has declined. Among the main companies, BWIN and Centrebet have a trend of lowering the home win odds after the midweek, so it is advisable to cautiously support the home team not to lose in this match. 7. Catania VS Juventus recommendation: Witschenich's performance was half good and half bad in the 10 games against Bologna, and Juventus thus ended its winning momentum. However, for Juventus, which failed to win any European qualification last season, the current performance can indeed significantly boost the team's confidence. The Turin Sports predicts that Juventus will make some adjustments to its line-up, with Eriksen replacing the suspended Vucini, and Matri as the lone striker. Juventus may line up in a 4-1-4-1 formation, which should also be a tactical preparation for the next round of AC Milan. The average odds of 3.833.161.96 are quite reasonable to look forward to Juventus to give half a ball with medium water, and it is more stable to double select Juventus to be unbeatable at home. 8, Parma vs. Rome recommendation: 30 About Rome, the focus is whether Enrique will follow Gasperini's footsteps if Rome continues to be undefeated? Besides Stekelenburg, who is out injured, all of Roma’s main players are available, and Enrique’s choice of team will therefore be even more interesting. In the confrontation between the two teams, Rome has an absolute advantage, with 15 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses in the league and cup since 2001, and has not lost in 6 consecutive away matches. Palermo is one of the teams with the most goals conceded in the current Serie A, and it is likely that the Palermo defense will be breached by the Roma forwards. However, with the return of Giovenco, Palermo also has the opportunity to score at home. Since Enrique commanded Rome to win in the official matches of this season, the average odds of 2.883.082.39 indicate that the confidence in the away team is not strong, and the possibility of a large score in this match is relatively large, and it is advisable to look forward to the two teams to win or lose. 9. Lazio vs. Palermo recommendation: 3 Once again, Reja, who resigned to provoke, finally led Lazio to win the first game of the season, and it is expected that the starting lineup of the previous round will continue in this game; Palermo won two consecutive home games after defeating Cagliari, but the performance of the first away game against Atalanta was still relatively weak. In the historical matches between the two teams, they are evenly matched, with each team winning 6 games and only 3 draws. Although Palermo is still leading in the points, the average odds of 1.813.314.27 still believe that after many core players left in the summer, Palermo will still face more challenges. The Asian initial handicap is half a ball with low water, and it is worth considering Lazio's main win as the胆. 10. Levante vs. Real Sporting, recommendation: 31, in the two teams' confrontation, Levante is 1 win, 3 draws and 4 losses, which is clearly in a disadvantageous position. However, Levante's performance this season is worth looking at. After defeating Real Madrid (Weibo) last weekend, Levante's morale has risen, and they won again in Vallecano away, and are now in the top ranks. Real Sporting still maintains the excellent characteristics of the home field. The current 6 points are all from home, and they have lost to Mallorca and Zaragoza in the away games, suffering two consecutive defeats. The average odds are 2.073.223.43. The main road is looking forward to the results of Levante, which are unexpected. The main company's home win odds have been adjusted from above 2.30 to 2.00-2.05. The Asian initial disk gives half a point with low water, and it is possible to slightly knock on the home team's unbeatable. 11. Granada vs Osasuna recommendation: 10 Granada won their first home game of the season against Villarreal, and from the strength of the team, this team, which returned to La Liga for the first time since 1976, is undoubtedly a big favorite to drop this season. Moreover, the team lacks players with rich La Liga experience, which is very unfavorable for Granada's survival. From the process and data of the game, Granada's victory over Villarreal was very accidental, and the fact that they did not score in the other three league games still indicates a problem. The average odds of 2.223.173.13 slightly favor Granada, but from the perspective of the main company's odds system, the probability of a win for the away team seems to be a little higher. 12. Huesca VS Santander Recommendation: 32001 since the two teams have met in the first and second levels, Huesca has 1 win, 2 draws and 5 losses, and is completely in the shadow. The only victory is the last second round of last season, and Huesca only succeeded in completely staying in the league after defeating Santander. Both teams had a poor start to the season, Xianghong lost four consecutive matches and ranked at the bottom, and Santander is also undefeated so far and ranks 4th from the bottom. The average odds of 2.053.223.49 still slightly favor the home side, Xihong, with the main company's home win basically distributed in the range of 2.00-2.05. The Asian initial disk gave the home team half a ball with high water. It is worth a try on the upper disk in this match. 13. Zaragoza vs Malaga recommendation: 30 Malaga has won three consecutive matches, with a total of 6 goals scored and 0 goals conceded in the three matches. The skills of the Chilean engineer are gradually coming out. Apart from Pellegrini, who else can combine a large number of new players into a team with such a good defense in a short period of time! Javier Aguirre, the coach of Zaragoza, is also a famous coach in the industry, who once coached Osasuna, Atletico and the Mexican national team. The average odds of 3.193.302.14 and their adjustments still favor Malaga playing away, but in the last two matches, Zaragoza's attack has been very fierce, and Malaga has no certainty of winning. 14. Rennes vs Saint-Etienne, recommendation: 3 In recent matches between the two teams, Rennes has a clear advantage with 5 wins and 2 draws in Ligue 1 and the cup. During the early stage of this season, Rennes also performed very well, currently ranking second in the league table and the top goal scorer in Ligue 1. Notably, Rennes' 17 goals so far have been scored by 9 players, indicating that Rennes' attack is not entirely dependent on the attacking core Victor Montano (Colombian forward), and the team's offensive points are diverse, and the scoring methods are varied, making it difficult for the opponent to guard. Saint-Étienne, after winning the first two matches of the season, suddenly fell into a slump, only getting 2 points in the last 5 Ligue 1 matches, and the excessive injuries clearly had a greater impact on the team. The average odds of 1.78, 3.28, and 4.47 are not much different from those of previous seasons, and the home team Rennes has a strong chance of winning.

      "['姚晨,李开复,叶茂中,徐新,杨浩涌,邓漫,吕英建,郭彦景,赵勇,孙雨', '正向', 'Several senior executives of Ganji.com resigned recently, and the public opinion triggered the speculation that Ganji.com was fooled: Ganji.com spent 200 million yuan on advertising, but because the donkey in the advertisement was too \"showy\", it was exploited by Ganjinong. Some netizens even shouted that the enemy has been on Ganji.com! Meanwhile, the attention and search volume of Ganji.com rose sharply. Did 51job really fall for it? Will the Donkey Network, which rose to fame through a public relations article, really be able to \"public relations\" the Ganji Network? Ganji Network rose to fame through a public relations article: Ganji, come on! I have a little donkey, I never ride it. This slogan is probably not unfamiliar to people who travel frequently. Starting from early February, the 15-second Ganji.com advertisement, endorsed by Yao Chen, was broadcast on media such as CCTV, subways, and bus mobile TV, launching a “carpet bombing” marketing campaign. What no one expected was that Banyu, a competitor of Ganji, registered a \"cloned\" Ganlidu website, riding on Ganji\\'s coattails. In addition to creating a website logo similar to Ganji.com, Ganlou.com also proposed a slogan similar to Ganji.com’s “Ganji.com, everything is here” – “Ganlou.com, nothing is missing?” ”, the degree of \"clones\" is quite shocking. Moreover, articles such as “200 Yuan Advertising Fee Makes Ganlvwang Famous” spread online overnight, with most of the content claiming that Baidu successfully leveraged its weight to achieve a thousand times the effect with just 200 yuan, registering the domain name “ganlvwang” for Ganjiwang, and reaping the benefits of Ganjiwang’s tens of billions of advertising effects, with a significant increase in traffic. To insiders, it is merely a dazzling hype. The job hunting website’s advertisement started airing at the beginning of February, and the search volume for the website was not high. Only after the article about Dala Network appeared online on the 19th of that month did the search volume increase significantly. Ganji.com seems to be less sympathetic to Ganji.com that was “cloned” than to use PR to counter the public opinion. On the contrary, there were doubts such as “Ganji.com just knows how to spend money” and “advertising creativity is defective.” In response, Zhaopin.com quickly launched a public relations counterattack. The gossip of celebrities undoubtedly amplified the effect of this \"donkey incident\". Li Kefu, the founder of Innovation Works, posted a question on Weibo: \"Test everyone: On the bottom of the Zhaopin homepage, there is a link to \\'Zhaodelu\\' as a friend link, but when you click on it, you will find that it is actually a link to Zhaopin, and you will return to the original page.\" Why? In fact, this was just a counterattack by Ganji.com to prevent Ganlu.com from diverting traffic. In addition, Ganji.com quickly purchased the keyword search “ganlu”. On March 15, Ye Maozhong, an advertising creative, said on Weibo: \"Because the short film \\'Little Donkey\\' of Ganji.com advertisement was a great success, Ganji.com investor Sun Xin, the president of today capital, sent me a new \\'Apple\\' to celebrate today.\" It is clear that this is a public relations move to deal with a crisis. Yang Haoyong, CEO of Ganji.com, said that “Ganlou.com” accounted for less than one-thousandth of the total search traffic. As a business, you should focus more on the user experience of the product and the company\\'s long-term development strategy, rather than some small tricks. A small trick brought in hundreds of users, but damaged the brand. Say a little more, even if it registers the domain name of Happy Net, what then? Years later, who still remembers the Donkey Network? The reason for the departure of senior executives is questionable. In the past two days, as Ganlu Network\\'s attention has declined, Ganji Network\\'s attention has stabilized. Just as the outside world thought that the matter would come to an end, Deng Man, vice president in charge of market and public relations at Ganji.com, and Liu Yingjian, vice president in charge of SEO (SEO refers to the use of search engine search rules to improve the ranking of a website in search engines), and SEO director Guo Yanjing resigned. Yang Haoyong confirmed the news to the press. Yang Haowei did not disclose the reasons for the departure of these executives. He denied it was because he had fired these people on the \"donkey incident\". He said, \"I left in January, before the ad campaign.\" The ad campaign is very effective, and we will continue to increase the investment. However, Guo Yanjing\\'s Weibo shows that Guo resigned on the last day of February. One netizen cried out: \"Even if the donkey ad is a case of skillful blunder, it can easily turn the blunder into a clever move, what\\'s wrong with that?\" Self-Destruction Great Wall, fell for the enemy\\'s trick! It is absurd that a company executive should resign in disgrace because of an advertisement. From a professional perspective, Ganji.com\\'s ads have no fatal flaws, and the effects of their multi-dimensional bombardment + classic songs + celebrity endorsements are obvious. A splendid hype emerged from the emergence of Ganlu Network, the counterattack of Ganji Network, and the departure of senior executives of Ganji Network. The attention of Ganji Network has been on a straight upward trend, and Ganlu Network, which was just registered, also gained a considerable amount of attention. Who won in this fight? Who was PR\\'d? First, Ganlu Network used online public relations to create public opinion, purchased keywords, and made a high-profile \"imitation\" that quickly attracted the attention of the media and netizens. Following that, Ganji.com\\'s ads were questioned by the public, and Ganji.com, its investors, and ad people all joined in the crisis PR. When the event was about to calm down, the senior executives of Ganji.com left their posts, pushing public opinion to another small climax. Without the interference of Mulei from Ganji.com, the Baidu attention index of Ganji.com would have remained at a high level until early March. Then, as the influence of the ads declined, so did the index of attention. An insider analyzed that Gan驴网\\'s \"cloning\" made more people know Ganji网, and amplified its brand for the second time. In this incident, there was no fierce battle between Ganlu Network\\'s PR offensive and Ganji Network\\'s counterattack. For Donkey Network, this is a pretty good public relations stunt. Zha Yong, a network public relations expert, commented that after Ganji.com launched its advertisement, Baixing.com immediately paid attention to it. Since Zhuban.com did not have enough funds to compete head-on, it came up with the strategy of Ganlue.com and launched soft articles online for public relations. As far as the reporters learned, many netizens did not know about Ganzilu.com until they read the public relations articles on the Internet, and did not directly associate the word \"Ganzilu\" with the advertisement of Ganji.com.

      "['杨秀红,刘锡汉,朱宁,李万锦,廖能成,覃永强,苏东升,左宗申', '正向', 'Shareholders have increased their holdings by more than 300 million shares, with a profit of more than 94%. Analyst Yang Xiuhong of Investor\\'s Daily reports that the stock market is declining, while the tide of shareholders increasing their holdings is coming. Since the stock index futures were launched on April 16, the A-share market has been in a state of fluctuating decline. The Shanghai Composite Index fell by about 8% in April and 10% in May. The market plunged, and in the face of widespread losses in both markets, news of listed company shareholders increasing their holdings against the trend kept coming. Many investors who couldn\\'t resist reducing their positions began to hesitate. According to the data research department of the Investor\\'s Daily, since April, listed companies\\' shareholders have increased their holdings by more than 300 million shares. Among them, the value of shares purchased in May exceeded the value of shares sold, achieving net value appreciation. Since the emergence of this phenomenon in October 2008, it has reappeared after 19 months. To observe the \"pushers\" behind this round of share acquisitions, the executives of listed companies are very enthusiastic, with many companies seeing more than ten executives collectively increasing their holdings. But the number of shares purchased by the executives of each company was \"much ado about nothing\", with most executives purchasing less than 100,000 shares. The bulk of the purchases, more than 90% of the total, were made by institutional shareholders. After aggressive buying, listed company shareholders have made a lot of money, and the purchased stocks have risen against the market plunge in April and May, bringing substantial paper profits to them. In May, the monthly increase reached a new high of 19 months, according to the data research department of Investor\\'s Daily. In terms of monthly data, after the cumulative number of shares announced in January exceeded 100 million shares, the number of shares in February and March shrank sharply to less than 8.73 million and 2.12 million shares, respectively. Accompanied by the sharp decline of the market since April, the scale of monthly share acquisitions by listed company shareholders has seen a large-scale rebound. Among them, the number of shares purchased in April increased to 21.99 million shares, up more than 9 times month-over-month. Subsequently, in May, when the stock market continued to search for its bottom, there was a rare wave of net purchases, with the monthly net purchase volume jumping to around 300 million shares, up over 12 times from the previous month. This was the second time that the net purchase volume approached 300 million shares after September 2009. There are only about ten months in history where the monthly increase exceeded 300 million shares. At the same time, the large fluctuations in the market value of shares held by listed company shareholders also appeared: the market value of shares held in January reached a new high, close to 1.6 billion yuan, while the market value of shares held in February and March dropped to 280 million yuan and 30 million yuan, respectively. With the emergence of the buying spree in April and May, the market value of the shareholding announcements also recovered to 350 million yuan and 3.2 billion yuan, respectively. As of June 15, listed company shareholders have cumulatively increased their holdings by about 320 million shares and the value of the increase exceeds 3.5 billion yuan since April. Behind the surge in purchases and the retreat in the scale of sales in May, a rare net purchase phenomenon was generated. According to our statistics, the cumulative announced share purchases by shareholders in May approached 3.2 billion yuan, surpassing the announced share reductions of about 1.9 billion yuan in the same period. Wind data shows that the last time A-share market saw net share purchases by shareholders was in October 2008, when the total market value of shares purchased by listed companies\\' shareholders was 1.1 billion yuan, and the total market value of shares sold was 1 billion yuan. This means that, after 19 months, the A-share market has seen a net increase in shareholdings by shareholders. And the pace of net share buybacks in May this year was even more intense than it was in October 2008, when the stock market bottomed out. Based on our previous statistics, the surge in share purchases by listed company shareholders usually occurs during the market bottoming stage, such as in October 2005 and September 2008. This time, the major shareholder has once again pushed a new round of buying spree, which undoubtedly gives investors in the \"bear market\" a glimmer of hope. China Yangtze Power has once again become the main target of increased holdings. Observing the main \"behind-the-scenes\" forces behind this round of increased holdings, there are three major forces, namely companies, executives, and individuals. Of the 78 announcements of share purchases made since April, 71 were made by executives and companies, accounting for 91% of the total. Among them, the number of times that executives announced to increase holdings reached 46 times, ranking first. There are many companies where a large number of executives have been collectively buying back shares. Such as Nantong Science and Technology, Changhang Oil Transportation, Liuhua Shares, and so on, there are more than 10 senior executives behind each of them. Among them, the announcement of COSCO Shipping Oil Transportation showed that 13 senior executives, including Chairman Liu Xihan, Vice Chairman Zhu Ning, and General Manager Li Wanjing, repurchased their own company\\'s stocks on May 13 and 14. The total number of shares purchased was about 570,000, with the transaction price ranging from 5.37 to 5.5 yuan. The CSRC\\'s announcement also showed that on May 13 and 14, the company\\'s chairman Liao Nengcheng, vice chairman and general manager Qin Yongqiang, director Su Dongsheng, and other 10 senior executives purchased about 670,000 shares in total. The number of shares held by each executive of listed companies has mostly been under 100,000 shares, with most executives only purchasing 20,000 to 30,000 shares; the executive who bought the most shares in May - Zongshen Power\\'s chairman, Zuo Zongsheng, increased his holdings by 1 million shares, with a value of only 10.15 million yuan, and the total number of shares held by all executives was only 3.9 million shares, accounting for only 1.2% of the total increase in April, and the increase in holdings is clearly \"much ado about nothing\". Some “company” shareholders, in contrast, have been more aggressive. As of April, a total of 16 shareholders have increased their holdings in the name of \"company\", with a total of 310 million shares and a total market value of 3.46 billion yuan, accounting for 98% of the total. According to the Wind data, there were two companies that announced an increase in holdings in April, namely Jidong Cement and Zhongxing Commerce. In May, the number of companies that announced an increase in holdings rose sharply to 22, with the top two in terms of the number of increases being Yangtze River Power and Guodian Power. The former\\'s major shareholder, the Yangtze River Three Gorges Group, announced an increase of more than 100 million shares, with an increase in value of more than 1.4 billion yuan; the latter\\'s major shareholder, the China Guodian Group, announced an increase in the purchase of 81.53 million shares, with an increase in value of 543 million yuan. As the main force of the increase, Yangtze River Power has not taken on the role of the monthly increase champion for the first time. In January this year, the controlling shareholder of Changjiang Power, the Yangtze Three Gorges Group, increased its holdings by more than 100 million shares in the same month, becoming the leader in the increase of holdings in that month. During the previous buying spree, the group had made multiple large-scale share repurchases. Such as the more than 10 million shares purchased in August 2009 and the nearly 200 million shares purchased in July 2006, etc. This round of shareholding increase has seen 94% of shareholders make profits. We have compiled the \"account books\" of shareholders in this round of shareholding increase since April this year, and the results show that most shareholders have made good returns. In the 78 announcements of share acquisitions since April, we have excluded the acquisitions that actually occurred before the second quarter of this year. Among them, the three companies, Guodian Power, Haixian Electrical Appliances and Liuhua Shares, have implemented the profit distribution and bonus share plan after the increase of shares by shareholders. We calculated their book profit and loss according to their bonus share plan. For the rest of the listed companies, we have calculated the difference between the average cost of share purchases by shareholders and the latest share price (the closing price on June 11, the same below). The final calculation shows that 94% of the additional holdings have brought positive returns to their shareholders. Among the companies that increased their holdings in May and announced the increase in May, Qingdao Hisense Electronics Co., Ltd., a shareholder of Hisense电器, had the largest increase in profitability, reaching 26%. In addition, Zongshen Power, Shanghai Jinling, Nantong Science & Technology, and other companies also brought more than 10% positive returns to their shareholders.']\n"

      "['周,周阳', '正向', 'Beijing Shuzheng: Trend Unchanged, Short-Term Adjustments Will Be Limited ⊙ Beijing Shuzheng, both markets opened lower on惯性 yesterday and fell sharply after hitting resistance, with the major index also breaking through the short-term moving average. The voices of the end of the market have become increasingly rampant. But from the perspective of quantity and price, or by judging from the hot spots, a rebound pattern is unlikely to have been reversed, and yesterday\\'s heavy losses only changed the operating speed, and may even become a spring rain to alleviate the \"drought\". The trend has not changed, short-term adjustments will be limited. Although the annual line is often given special attention, the Shanghai market has just encountered resistance at this line recently, but the annual line is far from as important as imagined, because the Shanghai market has already crossed the December line and stood on the 4th quarter moving average, while the Shenzhen market has already conquered all the annual lines calculated by day, week, month, and quarter. The key reason for the recent repeated fluctuations is that the cumulative increase in the past period was too large (the two markets rose by nearly 21% and 27% in a month, respectively), but the实体 length of the weekly阳线 gradually shortened, and a bad combination of 阴吞阳was formed on Friday last week. The indicators have also been in a high position for a long time, which means that the actual market has already undergone a subtle change. Repeated fluctuations may occur at any time, especially near the upper track of the recent channel. But noteworthy is that the intermediate trend (i.e. the line connecting the lows over the past one to two months) has not been broken, which is rising at a daily average of about 11.5 points, and is currently around 2304 points; secondly, there are many signs of an ascending wedge pattern formed in the previous attack, and when the market finds it difficult to expand its upward space, it often chooses to retrace the support of the trend line downward, that is to say, the correction of the channel (and the over-reading of the indicators) is needed, and the original upward trend line, the lows between March and April, and the 21-day moving average converge around 2300 points, and the short-term downward probe to this point and stabilize and recover is more likely. Reduction in volume is the right path. The trading volume in the past three weeks has continued to expand, but neither the weekly nor the daily trading volume has rewritten the record of the highest trading volume of the year. The increase in trading turnover has been reduced from over 40% to less than 4%. And by last week, the total trading volume of the two markets since the end of last October has reached 14.5 trillion, which is about half of the total trading volume when the market fell after the peak in October 2007. The short-term fluctuations are likely to increase naturally. However, this trading volume standard is actually insufficient, because the market\\'s circulating market value has increased significantly, and the absolute trading volume and turnover rate cannot be simply compared. Similarly, what is referred to as the area of heavy transactions in the early stage is not sufficient to constitute resistance, or the market pressure has actually been greatly reduced. Not only has the market capacity undergone significant changes, but from the nature of the market, it is not a good thing for trading volume to remain high for a long time, because a large volume is a necessary result of a large difference between bulls and bears, and a volume reduction rebound is more conducive to the continuation of the market. The term \"shrinkage\" does not mean that the volume continues to shrink, but rather that it expands and contracts in a certain appropriate range in line with the ups and downs of the market. In short, daily turnover exceeding 200 billion yuan may lead to the early end of the market, while turnover below 150 billion yuan will weaken the upward momentum. Therefore, 175 billion yuan is likely to be the most favorable. The blue chips, in my view, are unlikely to remain weak overall, and the short-term variables are therefore likely to increase, but such variables are at least likely to stop the decline and stabilize.']\n"

      "['巴勒莫,卡卡,因扎吉,安布罗西尼,马尔蒂尼,贝克汉姆,卡萨尼,里佐利,博沃,弗拉米尼,定春', '正向', 'AC Milan has a dagger straight to the heart of the media, the perfect leader will be born in a month. In the background of the goals of Kaka and Inzaghi, no one will ignore the assisters of the first two goals - Ambrosini. Sina Sports News Mediaset gave Ambrosini 7 points after the match, praising him for creating a penalty and assisting Inzaghi\\'s goal, and added a special sentence: \"Such Ambrosini has proved that he has the ability to be a perfect captain after June 1, 2022.\" After Martini\\'s retirement, Ambrosini will naturally rise from the current vice-captain to the first captain. Ambrosini\\'s contract with AC Milan expires in June 2010, and the Milan club has not offered a new contract. If Ambrosini is only a captain for one more year, it will be difficult for him to be at ease, and it will also be detrimental to the smooth transition of the dressing room in the future. At this delicate stage, Ambrosini first showed the club that, at least, my competitive condition is reliable. Ambrosini, 32, still played like a young man who does not know what fatigue is in the match against Palermo. The three-goal victory over Palermo was easy, the key was the two goals in the first 20 minutes, which crushed the morale of the opponent. Ambrosini got into the game from the start, heading a corner from Beckham in the 6th minute, but was blocked. In the 10th minute, Beckham sent a long ball to Inzaghi, but the Palermo defender failed to clear the ball out of the penalty area. Casani was waiting for the ball to fall from the air and clear again. Ambrosini had already leaped ahead and touched the ball in the air. Casani kicked Ambrosini from the air, which was undoubtedly a foul. Referee Rizzi decisively awarded a penalty, and Kaká opened the scoring for Milan. Ten minutes later, Inzaghi scored, and the move was particularly impressive. Ambrosini passed to Kaká in the left midfield and then inserted straight into the penalty area. Kaká did not control the ball and flicked it up with his chest, the ball falling in the exact spot where Ambrosini was running. Ambrosini sent a left-footed volley from the near post to the far post, where Inzaghi, unmarked, headed the ball into the goal. This is obviously a mature routine that Milan has practiced countless times. The cooperation between the three people is closely linked, and the technical aspect relies on Kaká\\'s passing technique. The most critical link in tactics is Ambrosini\\'s determined vertical insertion. In the 39th minute, Ambrosini opened up space on the left wing and immediately passed it to Inzaghi in the middle, but it was destroyed by Borriello. With Ambrosini\\'s physical condition, it is almost impossible to block him from the ribs to the straight line into the penalty area. This kind of running positioning is similar to his advantage in heading, but it is a rough element in AC Milan\\'s overall technical tactics, but it is also an essential element. With Ambrosini’s impact, AC Milan’s accurate passes can break through a link to form a direct attack, sometimes through a header, and sometimes through a run that breaks through the defense. In the previous round, Ambrosini scored a goal and created a penalty by charging vertically with unreasonable force, which resulted in a 5-1 victory over Torino. Ambrosini\\'s technical features are not unique, there are many defensive midfielders in the world who can run and tackle, but to reach the默契between Kaká and others, it is not a one-day job, and even Flamini, who was in his prime, found it difficult to play the same role as a defensive midfielder. In two matches, Ambrosini created two penalties, scored one goal and made one assist, fully proving his worth before the extension of the contract negotiations. AC Milan has many players who need to be cleaned, but Ambrosini, such a loyal and capable veteran, should never be underestimated. (Ding Chun)']\n"

      "['程洲,郑实', '正向', \"In September, the rebound funds quietly reduced their positions. According to the securities research report, more than 70% of the funds reduced their positions last week. The sharp decline of the A-share market in August has made many institutional investors' confidence fall to the bottom, and the market sentiment has turned pessimistic. However, since the end of early September, the market has stopped falling and rebounded, with the Shangzheng Index rebounding by more than 10%, and some individual stocks even rebounded by more than 50%. However, according to an incomplete statistics by the journalists, the public offering funds are reducing their holdings. According to the securities broker research reports, the stock positions of public offering funds have been reduced since September. According to the latest research report of Orient Securities, although the market continued to rebound in the recent period, the fund position continued to decline, and the reduction in position reached a new low in recent times. The report said that, whether in terms of the absolute number of positions or the number of positions reduced by funds, the main operation was to reduce positions, reflecting that funds were not optimistic about the market. The report shows that the average stock allocation of stock funds in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai in recent days is relatively even, at around 83%, which is significantly lower than the stock allocation last week, and the reduction in stock allocation is relatively consistent. In terms of fund types, the stock fund position fell from 86.21% last week to 83.75%, a decrease of 2.46 percentage points. Taking into account the impact of the market's own rise on the fund's position, the fund actively reduced its position by 2.95%, which is the largest single-week position in recent times. In terms of the number of funds, more than 70% of funds reduced their positions last week, while only 8.7% of funds increased their positions. In fact, many institutional investors have attributed the sharp decline in August to a correction of the rapid rise and high valuation in the early stage, as well as doubts about the actual economic recovery. In early September, many institutions were pessimistic about the market outlook for the second half of the year, and reduced their investment positions decisively, focusing on defensive varieties. Regarding the future trend of the market, many funds believe that although the market has recovered in the recent stage, it is not expected to last for a long time, and the Shangzheng Index will fluctuate within a certain range for most of the time, and the final trend still depends on the data of the third quarter reports that will be released in October. Cheng Zhou, the manager of Guotai Jinma Steadfast Fund, believes that the current position control of Guotai Jinma is around 75%, slightly lower than the industry level, and the holding structure is biased towards defense. Although such a configuration structure faced some pressure in July, looking back now, the defensive strategy is still very correct. Zheng Shi\"]\n"

The Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 30-day moving average, which sparked market expectations for a change in the market trend. However, the stock index slowly declined before the closing bell. Recent HSBC PMI preliminary data has returned above the 50 boom and bust line, and the CPI has fallen for two consecutive months, which has reduced the market's concern about a hard landing of the Chinese economy and a decline in inflation, especially Wen's mention of moderate fine-tuning has sparked market expectations of easing monetary policy, making the market shout a reversal, and investors are beginning to heat up in confusion, market risks are often generated in this way, the stock index takes the opportunity to rise, reflecting the market's anxious mentality, the stock index still has no foundation to build a bottom when the basic formation of housing prices and economic slowdown has not yet been shown, the rebound is only a process of changing the position of the stocks that are trapped, a continuous rise in stock prices provides a good opportunity for heavyweights to reduce their positions, change the position, take a rest, why not? The market's willingness to go long is not gone from the chart, and it is expected that the market will continue to oscillate and recover in the short term. However, as the height continues to rise, the upward force will gradually weaken, and the risk of chasing the rising market will gradually become apparent, but there are still some individual stocks that remain active in the market. But it is also difficult to walk out of a V-shaped rebound on a single upward trend in the short term. The market will inevitably have ups and downs in the future. The impact on the most important listed companies in A-share market, the risk of performance decline, the evolution of domestic and foreign debt risks, and the acceleration of stock market expansion have not changed, but there are signs of getting worse. Therefore, investors should adopt a cautious strategy in the market! [Macro Focus] 1. The EU 27 reached an agreement on bank capital restructuring. On October 26 (Beijing time on October 27), the EU summit reached an agreement on the bank capital restructuring plan, and the financial aid capital package may increase to 1 trillion euros. The EU summit of 27 countries reached a consensus, easing the current tense situation of the euro debt crisis, which has a significant impact on stabilizing the global stock market. But it remains to be seen whether the meeting can address the underlying risks of the eurozone debt crisis. 2 Zhou Xiaochuan: The general tone of monetary policy remains unchanged. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced on the 26th that PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said that the PBOC is closely monitoring the inflation level and will not ignore inflation because of the focus on economic growth. The current monetary policy tone remains unchanged, while maintaining sufficient flexibility and targeting. As can be seen from Governor Zhou Xiaochuan's remarks, monetary policy is still difficult to shift in the current economic situation. For A-shares, the bottom in both technical and macro aspects is emerging, but the monetary policy bottom has not yet been seen. 3. The MIIT will formulate measures to guide the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as the difficulties in production and operation of SMEs have attracted widespread attention recently. In response, Zheng Xin, director of the SME Department of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office yesterday that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is formulating policy measures to help small and medium-sized enterprises get out of the predicament. [Comment] The MIIT will formulate measures to guide the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which will have a positive impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, and related listed companies in A-share market are expected to benefit from the current trading opportunities. 4. The State Council will pilot a value-added tax reform in Shanghai next year. Premier Wen Jiabao presided over a State Council executive meeting on December 26 and decided to launch a pilot program for deepening the value-added tax system reform. The meeting decided to first pilot the reform in the transportation and some modern service industries in Shanghai. At the same time, in addition to the current standard VAT rate of 17% and the lower rate of 13%, two new lower rates of 11% and 6% will be introduced. [Comment] This reform will change the problem of excessive tax burden and repeated taxation in the service industry due to the collection of business tax, reduce the tax burden for enterprises, and also mean that modern service industries, led by the transportation industry, are expected to enter a new era of comprehensive tax cuts. Implementation of reforms will help promote the rise of the consumer industry and provide impetus for economic transformation. The A-share related service industries are expected to benefit for a long time. 5. The price of ring Bohai power coal has risen for 8 consecutive weeks. On October 26, the average price of port power coal with a calorific value of 5500 large calibers in the Bohai region was 853 yuan per ton, which has risen for 8 consecutive weeks, with a cumulative increase of 28 yuan per ton. Meanwhile, the procurement price of key power plants in East China has been rising for four consecutive weeks. The port coal price is rising continuously, but the industry is currently in a situation of having prices but no market. In the future, the upward momentum of thermal coal prices will weaken. Nevertheless, the rise in coal prices has helped coal stocks to stage a short-term rebound.

The reporter Wei Wei of the newspaper reported on February 11. It is not uncommon to send an apology message to his girlfriend, but to ask netizens to send an apology message to his girlfriend is not common. On the 10th, on a Woker online, Linyi netizen \"I love Xinxin\" posted a message online: to apologize to the girlfriend who had broken up with him on the occasion of Valentine\\'s Day, in order to win back the three-year relationship. After the post was released, nearly a thousand netizens \"surrounded\" it, and everyone extended a friendly hand to send an apology text message to his girlfriend. So far, 583 netizens have helped \"I Love Xinxin\" send apology messages. Xinxin, \"I Love Xinxin\" has realized its mistake, please give him another chance. We all hope that you can reconcile. After the netizen \"I Love Xinxin\" posted a post online, similar apology text messages were continuously sent to \"Xinxin\\'s\" mobile phone. Netizens, who have never met Xinxin, sent text messages to apologize to her on behalf of \"I Love Xinxin\" because they were moved by his devotion. The reporter contacted \"I Love Xinxin\", who works for a network company in Linyi, through the staff of Zhu Bajie Network. Originally, \"I Love Xinxin\" and \"Xinxin\" were college classmates, and the two have been dating for three years. Before the Spring Festival, the two people quarreled over trivial matters of sending gifts to their parents, and \"Xinxin\" proposed to break up in a fit of anger. However, \"I Love Xinxin\" felt that their long-term relationship could not be broken at will, and wanted to apologize to his girlfriend on Valentine\\'s Day, so he posted this thread on Zhubajie.com to ask netizens to help him. In the post, the journalist saw that \"Xinxin\"\\'s phone number was 159XXXXX142, and \"I Love Xinxin\" asked netizens to post the following content: \"Dear Xinxin, Valentine\\'s Day is coming soon.

Seeing him in such pain, I sent him a text message yesterday afternoon, which I wrote myself, hoping that Xinxin would give \"I Love Xinxin\" another chance. “Netizen” Suixin Baby said that when “Wǒ ài Xīn Xīn” first sought help, he thought that “Wǒ ài Xīn Xīn” was too blind to entrust a stranger to send a text message to the girl, which might disturb her life and instead attract resentment. Many netizens were found by the journalists to have offered advice to \"I Love Xinxin\". Some netizens suggested that \"I Love Xinxin\" should go to his girlfriend\\'s home to show sincerity, and another netizen suggested that on Valentine\\'s Day, he should take a bunch of roses to her workplace and wait for her to go home.']\n"

      "['曹玲娟,刘阳,尼尔森,周,王某,李某,张某', '负向', 'TV ratings have found that the risk of fake behavior is low due to the lack of third-party supervision, the covert methods, and the lack of punishment mechanisms. The main诱因 is the ratings and恶性competition. The lack of third-party supervision allows fake behavior to have a way in. Beijing, June 30, 2023. (Reporter Cao Lingjuan, Liu Yang) TV ratings fraud is becoming a shortcut for some local satellite TV stations to compete for the market. Recently, the reporters learned from their interviews that, compared with making programs, \"making\" ratings, with its low cost, covert and hard-to-verify fabrication methods, and the industry background of missing punishment mechanisms, is becoming a \"secret weapon\" for some local satellite TV stations to strive for the top in fierce market competition. It is said that the most reliable method for TV ratings in China at present is to install a similar set-top box TV viewing meter on the TV of sample customer families. When the sample household members watch TV, the set-top box will record and generate statistical data as long as they stay on a certain channel for a certain period of time. Since Nielsen, a globally renowned survey agency, ended its TV rating survey business in the Chinese market at the end of 2008, CCTV-Sofres Media Research Co., Ltd. has basically issued all TV ratings in China and major cities. According to insiders, \"rating\" as the \"universal currency\" in the current TV industry worldwide, provided by a survey institution recognized by the market, is conducive to the unification of industry standards and the standardization of management. However, under the premise of \"one dominant player\", compared with other countries, the lack of supervision and corresponding management and punishment mechanisms from a third party in the process of TV ratings survey in our country has reduced the risk cost of TV ratings fraud, and the phenomenon of manipulating the sample households of Sopore and \"rewriting\" TV ratings data has already occurred. Take Sohu in a first-tier city as an example. It is understood that the city has a permanent population of more than ten million, and currently, less than 500 households have installed TV measurement instruments to provide measurement data for Sorferry. Since the ratings of the satellite TV stations from other regions in this area are not high, the local research institution believes that the normal ratings of a satellite TV station throughout the day are about 0.2 to 0.3. But some professionals have recently found some abnormal viewing phenomena when analyzing the viewing data. For example, based on the data from some cities with national TV audience measurement systems, the Premier\\'s press conference after the closure of the National People\\'s Congress and the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference this year was simultaneously broadcast on all satellite TV stations in the country, but the ratings of the provincial satellite TV stations in a coastal region were more than twice as high as those of other satellite TV stations; on the evening of the national mourning for the Yushu earthquake, the program produced by CCTV News Channel required provincial satellite TV stations to rebroadcast, and the ratings of the provincial satellite TV station were also higher than those of CCTV News Channel itself. According to the relevant personnel, in some cities, as long as one sample household can successfully submit the data of the whole family watching a certain satellite TV for a whole day, the data of the satellite TV can rise to 0.3 to 0.5, almost doubling. The phenomenon of change has attracted the attention of some television research institutions. In the subsequent viewership data analysis, they also found that some TV stations were suspected of bribing the samples. In the home of a Mr. Zhou, a taxi driver in a direct-controlled municipality, a Sorfri measuring instrument was installed last spring. Within a month of installing the measuring instrument, someone knocked on the door, claiming that if they watched a certain TV program, they would receive 200 yuan per month, and there would be small gifts every week, and someone would also come to deliver a big gift bag during holidays. After that, the rating agency found on-site that there was indeed a bribe. The sample household has been revoked at present. Last year, a city TV station submitted a report to a rating agency about the suspicious changes in the viewing rates of 9 sample households. It was found that 6 of these 9 sample households were mostly locked on to one satellite TV station for a long time without any apparent reason. After the cancellation, the ratings of the satellite TV station in the city dropped immediately. Sample contamination is not limited to specific first-tier cities. In the “2009 Xi’an Top Ten Intellectual Property Cases” announced by the Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court to the media, the tenth case was related to this: Wang Sheng, a technical maintenance personnel of SORPO, was suspected of buying related sample households with Li Er of Xi’an TV Station and Zhang San, a TV short drama producer, and was prosecuted by the Xi’an Procuratorate for the first trial, in which Wang Sheng was sentenced to one year and three months in prison and fined 20,000 yuan. There have also been cases of abnormal ratings data in many places across the country. There is data showing that a TV station in its provincial capital city has a much higher rating during prime time than other TV stations, even more than 2.6 times; in the past October, several TV stations ranking high in the country have appeared in the provincial capital city, with irregular, multi-period, zero ratings. It is known that some satellite TV stations spend tens of millions of yuan per year on so-called brand promotion by private brand promotion companies, while a considerable portion of the funds is actually used to interfere with and falsify the viewing samples. Based on the information provided by the relevant \"polluted samples\", the way the samples were interfered with was relatively covert, mostly by sending small favors such as rice and cooking oil to the sample users regularly, locking them to the channel for a long time.']\n"

      "['萧笑笑', '正向', '12 Astrological Signs\\' Love and Career Weekly Advice (Photo Series) Author/Xiao Xiaoxiao This article is written based on the \"Weekly Planetary Forecast\". For more knowledge, please enter the Astrology Research Room to know our inner Aries: Crisis is one of the ways to express miracles. It is obvious that Aries is becoming the most prominent area. The Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, and Uranus have gathered here according to the agreement, and Mars will join next Saturday. Given the average human lifespan on Earth, a person has only one chance in a lifetime to witness such a wonder. After hesitating for a few minutes, I still decided to use the word \"miracle\". Since the Japanese earthquake, nuclear radiation and the topic of nuclear radiation have spread to the secular life like bacteria, and various complex emotions and reactions have flowed out from the dark corners that have never seen the light. People are either panicked by the threat to their own safety, or they wish to be destroyed together, or they are relatively calm and wait for the imagined life and death. Souls born and grown up in the era of harmonious prosperity and technology have never been so close to facing the crisis of species extinction, especially when the species involved is human. This is not a science fiction movie, dear, this is a miracle. I had no intention of mockery or hatred, but rather a deep sense that the numbness, coldness, and rigidity of human hearts had reached a critical point of saturation, and there seemed to be no possibility other than a reversal of extremes. Indeed, not everyone can transcend the images limited by the naked eye and directly reach the infinite cycle. An infinite loop has nothing to do with so-called completion. The Ram symbolizes pure rebirth, and also symbolizes the revolution of brain cells. It is often compared to a warrior by us, but a warrior cannot cover its vast and rich connotations. In other words, the Aries can play the role of a warrior to a certain superficial extent, but it is far from being a warrior in essence. Because the warriors are limited. It is a miracle itself. In contrast, the Double Fish means the end of the road. The \"change\" in \"When one is at his wit\\'s end, one must change; when one changes, one will find a way out; when one finds a way out, one can last long\" is Aries. Perhaps it is difficult for us to understand this sentence. Or try a metaphor, like the first time a mother feels the movement of her fetus, like the understanding between a man and a woman, like the beautiful scenery that leaves a deep impression on us, like the free repayment of small animals to us. Even the budding of new leaves on roadside branches is quite impressive. These are all the true intentions of life. The true purpose of life is a miracle. Disasters are merely one phenomenon, similar to function values. And it is a disaster because we define it as such. Finance: Seeking wealth with negative energy, even if the wealth is in hand, it is not satisfactory. Positive energy is the guarantee of seeking and obtaining wealth. Aries weekly golden sentence: Accept all facts, only by accepting can one show sincerity. In terms of fortune, there are four stars gathering in the wealth palace now, and they are all strong. Silver and two are flowing out in a torrent. Some people should be careful about the financial aspects of cooperation matters and be wary of the other party\\'s small-mindedness and private appropriation. In terms of investment, the profit situation before Friday is promising. If you can seize the opportunity, you can seize it; if you cannot, you can just watch the风云. In terms of career, the chaotic planetary impact has temporarily ended, but Jupiter finally broke through the soil and emerged, perhaps this is the first whiff of change in the status quo this year. It is called smoke because many people will jump into a new job in the next three weeks as if they were desperate and feverish, without realizing it. But after all, with the arrival of the Ram month, opportunities have increased compared to before, waiting to be carefully selected. In terms of emotions, singles have a certain understanding of themselves, but they may not know themselves as much as they think they do. Many times, they still need to see themselves through others. Those who are already in a relationship are struggling with reality or themselves, but the win or loss is all in a thought. The constellation of the honored person: Sagittarius. The constellation to be careful: Cancer. Cancer\\'s golden sentence for the week: Never imagine that your dreams can be completed together with others. In terms of financial luck, the first half of the week will allow you to spend money freely, while the second half will make you feel awkward about spending money, or even not spend any money at all. In terms of investment luck, you will lose more than you earn before Friday, and lowering your expectations will be better. In terms of career, the square of Saturn is the most direct pressure, and the source of pressure is the general desire of everyone to do better or innovate for easier competition in the macro environment. You are very busy on the surface, but in essence, you are just a screw in the competitive system. You will definitely feel tired not because of the workload, but because competition inevitably makes people tired. In terms of emotions, singletons will be less troubled if they are more narcissistic, as they will not know why their emotions and feelings arise; couples should not expect to change each other, even a little change is unrealistic. The constellation of the honored person: Capricorn. The constellation of caution: Sagittarius, Virgo. A golden sentence for the week: Psychological dependence is not cooperation. Merging two individuals into one is not cooperation. Inner independence is the foundation of cooperation. Because each individual can only be responsible for himself. In terms of wealth, Jupiter is roaring towards the wealth sector, and it is likely to be very easy to lose money in the next three weeks, but don\\'t worry, your income is guaranteed; in terms of investment, many planets are boiling here, and the ups and downs are very large, as the saying goes, the power of heaven is unpredictable. In terms of career, people often encounter interference questions from time to time. After answering the question type last week, a new question type appears this week. The questions are not intended to defeat you, but to require you to further answer - how to integrate the resources you have obtained to serve your own goals. It may sound a bit abstract, but the effect lasts for three weeks, and you will gradually understand it. In terms of feelings, some knots of the single may be instantly untied, perhaps due to the transformation of the earth itself, and you and others may come to the same conclusion, although some knots may still be stuck; couples always look to the future rather than the past. The constellation of the honored: Leo. The constellation of caution: Libra, Sagittarius. Golden sentences of the week: People who lack fame usually expect fame; people who have a little fame usually expect more fame. The thirst for fame, which we pretend is an excuse to \"make money\". But the real starting point is – fear of not being able to survive. In terms of fortune, Jupiter is not at all generous to the wealth sector, and it starts to plunder countless treasures, so you will lose money. Survival is not just about making money and saving money, but also about spending a lot of money. In terms of investment, the first half of the week is more likely to attract wealth than the second half. In your career, although the planets are not automatically aligned to the most prominent positions, Saturn has already had an impact on your mind. It is both a reflection of the harsh reality and a cultivation of rationality. Therefore, you will not be as restless or anxious as before. It seems like actions taken after everything has settled down or everything is set, which appears steady and unremitting. In terms of emotions, singles have accumulated enough resources to cultivate romance, and they can meet people who are interested in them without deliberately discharging electricity; last week, the couple had disagreements over trivial matters, but this week they are thinking about big issues rather than trivial matters. The constellation of the honored person: Taurus. The constellation of the careful person: Virgo.']\n"

A dog walking with a primary school student has become a touching landscape in the remote mountains. On August 19, Liao Jinping, a villager of Guxuan Village in Wenying Township, Chongyi County, told reporters that his daughter Liao Chun was escorted to and from school every day by the family\\'s black dog since she started second grade of primary school, until the big black dog died of illness when Liao Chun was in the sixth grade. Now the black dog\\'s child, the little black dog, has started to \"take over the job\" and continue to serve as Liao Chun\\'s bodyguard. Liao Jining\\'s family lives alone on a mountain in the village, and his daughter needs to walk for 2 hours every day to go to school. Since the mountain road to school was very remote, with high mountains and dense forests on both sides, Liao Jining usually took his 7-year-old daughter to school when she started first grade, and sometimes the family\\'s black dog would go along. When Liao Chun was in Grade 2, one day after school, he found that his big black dog was waiting for him at the school gate. Liao Jinping also found that Dabai was nowhere to be seen after lunch every day, in fact, it went to school to pick up the little master. So, Dahei took on the task of picking up and dropping off Liao Chun at school, and it was four years without a break. Last year, on a day, Liao Chun was suddenly met with a snake on his way to school, Da He \"whoosh\" rushed up and fought with the snake, in the end the snake was bitten to death, and Da He\\'s leg was also bitten by the snake. After Dahei was injured, he still safely delivered Liao Chun to school. Liao Chun, recalling the days with Dahei, said that Dahei was very strong, and with it, walking on mountain paths was not only no longer scary, but also very interesting. Sometimes, when walking on the road, she would hang her schoolbag on Dahei, and Dahei became a naughty little book-attendant. Last December, an unfortunate event occurred. Dahei suddenly lost his former luster, lying on the ground listlessly, sick. Although it was carefully tended to and treated by its master, it still said goodbye to its master\\'s family and its own post. Liao Jinping\\'s wife said that the dog was really intelligent, a good dog, and that it had made many contributions to us in the past four years. We were all very sad when it died, and Liao Chun cried for a whole day. To make it closer to us, we buried it next to the house. Now, Dahei\\'s \"son\" - Xiaohēi, also picks up and drops off Liao Chun to and from school every day. Reporter Du Jinchun and intern Qin Hong']\n"

The team is expected to get a generous sponsorship. The previous night, Chen Jin, a badminton player from Jiangsu, won the gold medal in the men\\'s singles at the World Championships, which sparked a badminton craze in Jiangsu. Not long ago, the Jiangsu badminton club was once worried about sponsorship problems, because of the lack of money, the club even had the idea of selling Chen Jin. After Chen Jin won the world championship, many merchants paid attention to badminton again. Yesterday, an entrepreneur came to the Express News proactively, clearly expressing the intention to sponsor the Jiangsu Badminton Team, hoping that the Express News would take the lead to promote this matter. When the news was relayed to Sun Zhi\\'an, the general coach of the Jiangsu badminton team, Sun expressed his excitement, saying, \"If there is really sponsorship, we will definitely keep Chen Jin.\" \"National and provincial levels will clearly reward sponsors 100,000 yuan. In recent days, in Nanjing, people talk more about badminton. In the Yiguan Sports School badminton room, it is even more heated. All amateur players who see Jin Chao, the father of Chen Jin, will give him a big thumb up. Old Jin is smiling on his face and happy in his heart. Everyone even vied to invite Old Jin to have a meal, and Old Jin would agree with a smile. In order not to disturb his son\\'s rest, Old Jin did not bother him too much, but his friends were eager to send messages to Chen Jin to congratulate him. The mature Chen Jin would reply to each one without any star\\'s airs. \"We must celebrate Chen Jin\\'s success when he comes back.\" Mr. Yang, an old friend of Mr. Jin, told the reporter excitedly. After 11 years, Nanjing has produced a gold medal with such high value in men\\'s singles, and everyone is naturally very excited. Messages of congratulations from the district and the city kept coming in. This time, the championship at the World Championships will definitely reward Chen Jin. The specific reward amount is not yet clear, but according to the coach of the Jiangsu team, according to the usual practice, it may be rewarded 100,000 yuan, and the provincial government will also reward Chen Jin, the same as the national standard. In addition, the sponsors of the Chinese badminton team also clearly stated that they would give Chen Jiaoneng 100,000 yuan. Chen Jin performed well, and sponsors came to him. Recently, Sun Zhi\\'an, the general coach of Jiangsu badminton team, has been worrying about the sponsorship problem of Jiangsu badminton club. He once imagined that if the sponsorship funds were insufficient, he would sell Chen Jin, on the one hand to increase the operating funds, and on the other hand to give some opportunities to other young players. However, with Chen Jin and Cai winning the championship at the World Championships, the impressive performances of the Jiangsu players at the World Championships have once again raised the popularity of badminton in Jiangsu. Currently, there are already companies that have proactively approached them, hoping to engage in in-depth cooperation with the Jiangsu Badminton Team. Although it was only an intention and not the final contract, this has already given the Jiangsu badminton team a glimmer of hope. Once the sponsorship funds are in place, the Jiangsu team will no longer have to worry about whether to sell Chen Jin or not. \"If there is enough sponsorship money, we will definitely keep Chen Jin in the team. No one wants to do this, and often it is also a kind of helplessness.\" Sun Zhi\\'an told the reporter. Last year, due to insufficient funds, the Jiangsu Badminton Club performed averagely in the Super League of Badminton and failed to advance to the final. In fact, if the club had sufficient operating funds, it would not have been difficult for the Jiangsu team to advance to the final, let alone win the championship. Next month, I look forward to the reunion of old and new champions in Jiangsu. After just finishing the World Championships, Chen Jin is still busy, and he will go straight from Paris to Beijing to continue training. Because he will have to prepare for the national championships and the Badminton Masters in Changzhou, Jiangsu, next mid-month. The Master\\'s 10th will be held in Changzhou, and I will definitely go to see my son then, because he will definitely have no time to go back to Nanjing before that. Chen Jin\\'s father Jin Chao told the reporter. In fact, for junior Chen Jin, some senior predecessors of Nanjing badminton team were also very concerned. Senior badminton world champion Yang Yang specially called Chen Jin\\'s father to ask how to watch the match after he could not see the live broadcast the night before, and was happy for Chen Jin when he won the championship. In fact, Old Jin had an idea, that is, he hoped that Chen Jin could come back and meet these former champions in Nanjing. \"Yang Yang and Sun Jun invited them to have a get-together, there is no problem, but I\\'m afraid that Chen Jin doesn\\'t have time to return to Nanjing.\" Old Jin told the reporter. Indeed, Chen Jin has been training with the national team for years, apart from competitions. I wonder if Chen Jin can find some time to visit his hometown, Nanjing, which is so close to Changzhou.

      "['张晓琳,王建钧', '正向', 'Bye-Bye BYD Returns to A-share Market, New Energy Vehicles Have an Advantage□Zhang Xiaolin,Reporter of China Business News2009, with the promotion of national policies, the car market was booming. Tax incentives for car purchases, the promotion of new energy vehicles, and the mergers and reorganizations of auto companies became the key terms of the auto policy in 2009. Yesterday, Securities Daily reporters interviewed Wang Jianjun, vice president of sales and spokesperson of BYD, exclusively to explain the development of new energy vehicles. National Policies Promote the Development of New Energy Vehicles: Securities Daily: National policies have fueled the booming car market in 2009. What kind of preferential policies has the state given to BYD in terms of new energy vehicles? Wang Jianjun: The fiscal subsidy management measures for energy-saving and new energy vehicles, which were introduced at the beginning of 2009, stipulated that the state would subsidize the purchase of new energy vehicles according to the fuel-saving rate and technical level, not only promoting the development of the new energy vehicle industry, but also guiding domestic brands to accelerate the research and innovation of new energy vehicles, and promoting the upgrading of new energy vehicle technology. This is a good opportunity for BYD, which further strengthens its resolve and confidence in developing new energy vehicles. BYD will launch more DM models in the future, including F6DM and F0DM, and will also launch pure electric models later. Currently, the F3DM of BYD has been included in the first batch of the \"Recommended Vehicle Model Directory for Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Demonstration and Promotion Projects\" of the country, and it is the only brand included in the sedan category. According to the new subsidy policy for new energy vehicles issued by the Ministry of Finance at the beginning of this year, each F3DM car produced by BYD has the opportunity to apply for a maximum subsidy of 50,000 yuan. The Securities Daily: How do you think the competition situation of new energy vehicles now is? Are there any other domestic companies that are relatively mature in manufacturing new energy vehicles besides BYD? Wang Jianjun: Currently, car companies around the world are developing new energy vehicles, because new energy vehicles are the inevitable trend of future car development, and competition in this area will become increasingly fierce. BYD has always adhered to the development concept of technology as king and innovation as the foundation. BYD hopes to make the world a better and healthier place through its own efforts. It believes that in the field of new energy vehicles, BYD can achieve an absolute competitive advantage through its own research and development and technology, creating a better environment for society and building a green and healthy tomorrow. Three advantages over General Motors and Toyota. Securities Daily: As a leader in new energy vehicles, what unique competitive advantages does BYD have? Wang Jianjun: Even compared with General Motors and Toyota, which are advanced in new energy vehicle technology, BYD still has three advantages. First, BYD F3DM can reach 100 kilometers driving range. Second, BYD F3DM has strong power. The 0-100 km/h acceleration performance of F3DM is 10 seconds; third, F3DM can be charged by plugging in, and can be charged with a household 220V power supply. And F3DM was commercialized earlier than Toyota and GM, and was launched in the Chinese market by the end of 2008. Moreover, based on its industrial background, BYD’s strong vertical integration is also a major advantage. BYD can effectively integrate battery, electric control, and electric motor technologies, achieving commercial operation of electric vehicles. Meanwhile, BYD’s DM plug-in hybrid has overcome the technical challenges of repeated charging and charging from domestic sockets, and ensures safety and durability. . Securities Daily: You just said that the F3DM dual-mode electric car of BYD has been included in the first batch of \"Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Demonstration Application Model Directory\" of the country. However, many consumers are not very familiar with this dual-mode electric car. Could you introduce this car and what advantages does the dual-mode electric car have over ordinary cars? Wang Jianjun: Compared with traditional fuel cars, F3DM from BYD has two special advantages: superior power performance: F3DM is equipped with BYD371QA all-aluminum engine, and the dual-mode electric vehicle drive system greatly improves the power and torque of the motor. The maximum output power of BYD F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle reached 125KW, which is equivalent to the superior power performance of 3.0L engine, and will bring a new driving pleasure to the driver. In addition, at the initial stage, the F3DM plug-in hybrid electric vehicle from BYD has a much stronger instantaneous acceleration performance than that of engines of 3.0L level. Cost-effective to use: In terms of fuel economy, the F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle consumes only 16 kWh per 100 kilometers in pure electric mode. With an electricity price of 0.6 yuan/kWh, the cost of driving 100 kilometers is about 9.6 yuan RMB. The DM dual-mode power system adopts the latest engine of BYD, which makes the fuel consumption rate of the engine in the system less than 250g/kwh under any operating condition. And the relevant survey shows that more than 90% of people travel less than 100 kilometers per day, which means that most people will be free from the high oil price with the use of BAIC New Energy DM dual-mode electric vehicles. Since the cost of electricity is only one quarter of that of fuel, it is undoubtedly an absolutely economical choice for consumers. The Securities Daily: There are three aspects of technological breakthroughs in new energy vehicles: battery capacity, engine system and electronic control system. Which aspect is the most successful for BYD, and what scientific and technological achievements has BYD made in these three aspects? Wang Jianjun: Battery capacity: BYD adopted the most advanced iron battery technology in the new energy vehicle field, leading to technological innovation in automotive power. Automobile power batteries are difficult in five aspects: high safety, low cost, long life, green and environmental protection, and complex process. And BYD\\'s \"iron battery\" has made breakthroughs in all five of the above indicators. Engine system: It has been explained in the previous question. Electric control system: F3DM is equipped with the DM dual power hybrid system, which is the world\\'s first. DM is the abbreviation of DUALMODE. DM dual-mode electric vehicles adopt electric vehicle systems (EV) and hybrid systems (HEV). It is an advanced technology that combines the control of electric motors and motors, not only reducing fuel consumption and emissions, but also greatly improving power and handling performance, achieving multiple energy replenishment methods that can be charged and refueled, and realizing a true dual power hybrid system. Has BDI declared its intention to return to the A-share market? Securities Daily: Does BDI have any intention of returning to the A-share market? Wang Jianjun: BYD announced in July 2009 that it was in the process of applying for listing in Shenzhen in accordance with the relevant regulations of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the funds raised would be used for the production of lithium-ion batteries, automobile research and development, expansion of automobile products and automobile parts, and solar cell projects. BYD believes that the issuance of A-shares will establish a new financing platform for the company, and enable the company to expand into different securities markets, thereby ensuring that the company strengthens its business development and further enhances its competitiveness. The Securities Daily: How was BYD\\'s sales in 2009? Due to the mass production of cars can greatly reduce costs, what are the sales targets in 2010 and the future? Wang Jianjun: BYD\\'s sales of cars exceeded the expected 400,000 units in 2009, reaching 450,000 units, with a year-on-year increase of 162%, and sales have grown by 100% for six consecutive years. Based on the market performance in 2009, the model F3, a model of honor, sold more than 30,000 units per month, becoming the only member of the \"30,000 Club\" in the Chinese car market; the F6 New Wealth Edition sold more than 6,000 units per month; the premium small car F0 sold more than 10,000 units per month, becoming the king of the new generation of micro cars; the new mid-range premium family car G3, with the increase in production capacity, further released market potential, and challenged the sales of 10,000 units per month. These models are also expected to continue to grow in volume in 2010, contributing to BAIC\\'s market targets. BYD plans to launch five new heavy-weight models, L3, I6, G6, S6 and M6, in 2010, and aims to achieve a production and sales target of 800,000 units in 2010 by striving for a perfect improvement in product quality, and aims to achieve another 100% leap growth. Among them, the new models L3, I6, G6, S6, and M6, etc., will bear the sales target of 170,000 units, further providing strong support for dealers with new models. M6, as BYD\\'s first premium full-size MPV, will be launched at the best time when the economy is stabilizing, and will be sold online. L3 has already entered the latest batch of national new car directories, and will be another premium mid-size car for BYD. The new G6, S6, I6 and other premium products will also be unveiled in 2010.']\n"

On March 30, the New Jersey Nets played at home at the Izod Center against the San Antonio Spurs. In the end, the Nets beat the Spurs 90-84. Yi Jianlian played for 31 minutes, scoring 8 points and grabbing 7 rebounds. This game was the Nets' 10th victory of the season, and they broke away from the worst record in NBA history with this victory. For Yi Jianlian personally, this game also had a deep meaning. Before this game, Alin's total points and rebounds in this season have reached 510 and 296, respectively. He only needs to grab 4 more rebounds to complete the data of 500+ points and 300+ rebounds in the third consecutive season. To know that, before this, only Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets was a Chinese player who could reach the above data in the NBA. During his rookie season, Zhou Yuan represented the Milwaukee Bucks and played in 66 games, eventually scoring 566 points and grabbing 344 rebounds; in his second season, after joining the Nets, Zhou Yuan played in 61 games and eventually scored 525 points and grabbed 326 rebounds; in this season, Zhou Yuan frequently suffered from injuries, and so far he has only played in 44 games. If he participates in all the remaining 8 games, the total will be only 52 games, which will definitely set a new low for his attendance rate in his NBA career. But, through the above data comparison, it is not difficult to see that in the first two seasons, more than 60 games were needed for the team to score 500+ and 300+ rebounds, while now more than 40 games, and the team has already achieved it. So it is clearly wrong to say that Zhou Yuan’s third season in the league did not progress; he has improved his efficiency and become more productive. Of course, compared with Yao Ming's feat of scoring 1000+ and grabbing 400+ rebounds in a season for seven consecutive seasons, it will take a long time for Han to catch up, but at least he has proved that there is not only Yao Ming who can really make it in the NBA, he will never be a fleeting passer-by in the NBA. Recently, Yahoo Sports said that how to complete the last 9 games of the season (now 8 games) will be the most important evaluation of Zhou Yuan's season, which was broken by injury. If Zhou Yuan can finish strongly, it will definitely give the Nets enough confidence to choose to keep him in the team for the new season. Today, despite the pain in his right shoulder, Alen scored a three-pointer to take the lead in the fourth quarter, helping the Nets win the game. It is believed that in the next 8 games, he will continue to prove his value. (A penny)\"]\n"

Although the immigration industry is policy-oriented, there has been no mainstream immigration country that has issued a notice to modify or adjust immigration policies due to the swine flu so far, but a series of problems related to daily life caused by the swine flu are fermenting. As of 28 p.m. Beijing time, the number of people who have died from swine flu in Mexico and those who are suspected of dying from it has risen to 152, and the number of suspected cases has approached 2,000. In view of the current trend of the spread of swine flu, the World Health Organization has raised the warning level of the flu pandemic from 3 to 4. \"Level 4\" means that a new virus is spreading among people, which can cause \"epidemic\" outbreaks. It is reported that in order to prevent the swine flu from entering and causing a possible large-scale outbreak, many countries around the world have already launched emergency measures and implemented infrared temperature detection in the cabins of direct flights from the United States, Canada and Mexico. The United States and Canada, as old-time immigration countries, have become the worst-hit areas of the current swine flu. To a certain extent, it is inevitable that the recent guests will be panic-stricken. In the long run, a temporary viral infectious disease should not affect the immigration industry. Some netizens jokingly said that if pigs were to apply for immigration at present, they would be banned from landing. Currently, the WHO has not yet recommended travel restrictions and border closures as a response, so I suggest that you do not worry, and if you have the intention to immigrate, you should seize the opportunity to apply for immigration during the period when the immigration policies are relatively relaxed due to the financial crisis.']\n"

On 17 June, the euro / Swiss franc touched a record low, as the market was concerned that Greece\\'s debt problem might further deteriorate, and the government could not reach an agreement on austerity measures. However, the euro pared losses after Olli Rehn, the EU’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, issued optimistic remarks. Ryan said that Greece could get a loan from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July if it cut its budget. The IMF also stated its support for Ryan. John McCarthy, head of currency trading at ING Groep NV in New York, said, \"We are seeing generally weak global economic data, coupled with lingering concerns about Greek debt, which are both detrimental to risk sentiment, and this is another reason for the market to sell euros.\" \"Bank of New Zealand Ltd.\" of New Zealand. Mike Burrowes, a currency strategist, notes that if risk sentiment continues to dominate the market and concerns over the eurozone debt problem cannot be alleviated, the euro / US dollar is expected to continue to be under pressure and decline, while the US dollar, franc, and yen will benefit from risk-on buying. The EUR/CHF is trading around 1.2025, down 0.60% from the previous trading day, and hitting a record low of 1.1946 during the session; meanwhile, the EUR/USD is trading around 1.4150, down 0.14% from the previous trading day, and hitting the lowest level since May 26, 1.4073. GoldmanSachsGroupInc. Thomas Stolper, chief currency strategist, pointed out in a conference call that the franc against the euro has become the most overvalued currency pair. After the austerity program was opposed by the opposition party, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will reshuffle the cabinet today and try to win back the public\\'s trust vote. Ryan, the EU Council, was convinced after a \"close contact\" with the IMF that the meeting over the weekend would adopt a resolution that Greece would receive 12 billion euros in aid in July, as long as it could cut its budget. To avoid Greece\\'s first default in the eurozone, the EU will provide 87 billion euros to Greece in July this year as part of a package of rescue measures last year, and another 33 billion euros will be provided by the IMF. Caroline Atkinson, a female spokesperson for the IMF, stated in an email on Thursday: \"Discussions on Greece\\'s rescue are making progress to ensure that sufficient financing programs are in place. We expect positive results at the next Eurogroup meeting.\" Alan Ruskin, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG, a G10 bank based in New York, said that as Greece began to see some hope of assistance in July, market risk appetite also improved slightly. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Berlin tomorrow to work towards an agreement on a package of aid for Greece. Goldman Sachs expects the euro/dollar exchange rate to be 1.45, 1.50 and 1.55 in the next 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively.']\n"

According to China Daily, Hungarian Foreign Minister said yesterday in Chongqing that EU countries have yet to reach a consensus on whether to lift the arms embargo on China. BalázsPéter, the foreign minister of the country, pointed out that whether to lift the ban requires the 27 EU member states to negotiate and decide, \"and the problem is whether the conditions for lifting the ban are met.\" “Indeed, this is a very sensitive issue,” Péter, the foreign minister, told China Daily. We (member states) need to have a discussion. He said to check whether the conditions are met and when they should be met, but did not elaborate. The EU began an arms embargo against China in 1989, but discussions on this issue have been intense in recent months since Spain took over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU last month. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said on January 26 that his country was weighing the pros and cons of the EU’s ban on arms sales to China. Moratinos added that, in addition to Spain, France has been the main country supporting the lifting of the ban, and that “Spain is joining the ranks of those supporting its lifting.” Early Spanish ambassador to China, Carlos Blasco Villa, also told China Daily that the country \"hopes to further discuss the lifting of this ban.\" But Hungary\\'s foreign minister Péter stressed yesterday that all EU member states must reach a consensus on this issue. We have a close alliance with the other 26 EU member states. We have the obligation to discuss with 26 countries the relevant steps for lifting the embargo,\" he said after the opening ceremony of the Hungarian Consulate General in Chongqing, Southwest China. Though the minister indicated that Hungary did not support trade restrictions, weapons are “sensitive products closely linked to peace and stability.” It requires 27 countries to decide. Compared with the EU of just six founding countries at the time, it has become more complex. We must reach an agreement with our partner countries in Europe, \" he added. Moreover, according to an unnamed diplomat cited by a business information service website, Eubusiness.com, the EU is reluctant to lift the embargo for security reasons, unless it is done in tandem with the US. But David Shambaugh, a professor at George Washington University and a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, does not believe that the US will have an impact on China and the EU on this issue. There is no consensus on this issue, but I believe the embargo will not be lifted,\" Shambaugh said at an event of the EU delegation in China yesterday, and the group of countries has not reached an agreement. He said that neither Central European countries (including Hungary) nor the Nordic Scandinavian countries agreed to lift the ban. And neither Germany and the UK, the other major EU countries, have made a decision yet. However, the lifting of the ban will significantly improve the relationship between China and the EU, Zhao Chen, an analyst from the European Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out. The lifting of the arms embargo on China is more of a political issue than a purely military one. Zhao Chen said that some countries in Central and Eastern Europe could not benefit much from the lifting of the ban because they had no military factories. And those who oppose easing the ban do so because these countries still view China today through the lens of values. But if the arms embargo is lifted, it would be a major sign of a full warming of Sino-central European relations, Zhao said.

Wang Ming昌, a tricycle driver in Nanqiao Village, Jiangpan Township, relies on operating a tricycle for a living. On the evening of August 7, Wang Ming昌 did not sleep in the house because he had a gathering with friends, and therefore escaped the disaster. When he returned home, the two-story small house had been flattened by a mudslide, and there was a wail all around. Wang Mingchang saw that many houses had been washed away by the mudslide into the river, and some of the disaster victims were calling for help from high places on the ruins. Wang Mingchang recalled his living tricycle, took off the three wheels, and made a simple raft with wooden boards. The Qingfeng Hotel in Zhouqu was washed down the Bai Long River by the mudslide, and many passengers stuck their heads out of the windows, shouting for help continuously. Wang Mingchang held the small boat and rushed down the river. Facing the surging river water, it was not clear whether it was familiar with driving this job or whether the determination to save people overcame fear. Wang Mingchang soon mastered the secrets of the small raft. The small raft could only save one or two people at a time, and Wang Mingchang went back and forth to save people, rescuing a total of 74 people. Wang Aiqiang and Wang Caiqiang are neighbors of Wang Mingchang. After the disaster, they did not care about the property at home and rescued people as soon as possible. Three disaster victims were trapped on the edge of the landslide dam, clinging to the rocks on the edge of the cliff to avoid falling into the river, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Wang Aiqiang’s brothers borrowed ropes from house to house, and then connected the ropes together to a length of 50 meters. Wang Aiqiang\\'s brother held a rope and came to the edge of the dam lake, put the rope around the disaster victims, and then slowly put them on Wang Mingchang\\'s small rubber raft. After these three disaster victims were rescued, they looked at their hands and found that all ten fingernails were flipped and there was not a single good one. Story 2: Shout loudly, 9 people escaped. Huan Yiming, 49 years old, is from Huayang Mountain in Huancheng Town, Zouchu City, and does wholesale beverage business. On the night of August 7, he was sleeping at home when he suddenly heard the sound of running water behind the house, and he subconsciously judged that it might be a mudslide. Han Yiming said that the sound of the mudslide was louder than before, and he immediately woke up his wife and two sons who were still sleeping. Han Yiming ran to the 3rd floor of his building and shouted loudly to the residents downstairs, \"Wake up, run to the mountain quickly.\" Huan Yiming screamed for more than ten times with all his strength, and his voice grew louder and louder, but few residents downstairs responded. Huan Yiming\\'s voice was hoarse. A few minutes later, nine residents ran up the mountain and stayed at Huan Yiming\\'s home, and in the end, they were saved. Han Yiming recalled that the mudslide was getting bigger and bigger, and the big stones on the mountain were rolling down continuously. After they hit the houses on the lower part of the mountain, the sound of houses collapsing and the sound of glass breaking could be heard. In less than half an hour, the houses of several families below his building were all washed away by the mud and water flow, and the houses no longer existed. \"I have never encountered... too terrible,\" Huan Yiming could not calm down when he recalled the situation at that time. In this disaster, Huan Yiming’s two business outlets were flooded, and he said that the loss was over one million yuan. But thinking of the whole family surviving, Huan Yiming already felt that it was a stroke of luck. Both of their sons are now volunteers, helping the residents in the county town move goods free of charge. Fortunately, Huan Yiming’s parents were rescued when the incident occurred, as they lived in a three-story building near the dam in the county town. Xu Chen, a reporter from the羊城晚报']\n"

      "['边铁城,陈洁', '负向', \"Netseer's high growth is questionable: low business barriers, concentrated large customers, and a high-tech label, but in fact, it is more like a service provider. Netseer's executives claimed a compound growth target of 50% in the next three years before the listing, which is no longer recognized by the market. Post-IPO performance took a turn for the worse. In the first three quarters of 2009, Wansu Technology achieved a net profit of 34.86 million yuan, up 39.38% year-on-year. But in 2009, NetEase's net profit was only 38.8514 million yuan, with a year-on-year increase of only 4.78%, but after deducting non-recurring gains and losses, NetEase's net profit decreased by 4.79% year-on-year. That is, the company's performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 dropped sharply. Performance in the first quarter of 2010 declined more sharply, and the net profit of NetEase Technology in the first quarter showed a decrease of 61.13% year-on-year, and the revenue also decreased by 5.54% year-on-year. For this, NetEase's explanation is that the整顿of the Internet by the state has suppressed the demand for a portion of IDC and CDN businesses. However, this explanation was not entirely accepted by the market, as the costs of NetEase Technology increased significantly in the face of declining operating income, with sales expenses growing by 90.74% year-on-year and management expenses growing by 44.73% year-on-year. Moreover, the general manager resigned immediately after the company went public. Low business threshold, apart from cost factors, the fundamental reason for NetEase's poor performance is the company's business. Netseer's main business consists of two parts: one is IDC business, and the other is CDN business. So-called IDC business is actually the leasing and hosting of network servers and related other businesses. CDN is a content delivery network business, which adds a new network architecture to the existing Internet to make users get the server closest to them, thereby improving network connection speed. IDC business is almost devoid of technology, merely providing a service for network equipment space. Many companies are currently involved in this business. Although NetEase claims to be the leader in IDC business, its market share is very small, only a few percentage points. “Xinda Securities IT business analyst Tiance Ben said, “CDN business has a certain level of technology, and the demand in the future will be more and more.” However, even CDN business lacks a barrier to entry. Foreign CDN business has been carried out for many years, and domestic CDN business has no technical advantage and only needs a certain amount of equipment investment to join. The lack of unique customer resources is more important for NetEase's sales and channels involved in its business. But at present, NS focuses on this aspect also lacks an advantage. In the prospectus, NetEase Science and Technology stated that well-known companies in the online game and streaming media industry had signed long-term service contracts with NetEase Science and Technology, including customers such as Tencent, Sohu, and Jouyou Network. However, there are many business providers that offer CDN and IDC services to these customers, and the customers do not have any exclusivity. Part of the original CDN business customers have already started to operate their own CDN business, such as Youku and Tudou. Another hidden danger of the company is that Zhenzhu Technology's major customers are too concentrated, with more than 25% of business income coming from Tencent. What if Tencent CDN also did it themselves? Does NetEase still have performance? A stock investor questioned this on the stock forum. Growth potential is hard to support stock price, and the industry is highly competitive and lacks unique customer resources, which means that NetEase lacks sufficient bargaining power. This problem has been reflected in the company's continuously declining gross margin, which dropped from 37.75% in the same period last year to 34.93% in the first quarter of 2010. Given the current situation, it is possible for NSIT to maintain a 30% compound annual growth rate in revenue, but it is more difficult to maintain a 30% growth rate in net profit, and a 30% growth rate is the most basic requirement for a small company. An analyst in the IT industry of a securities firm pointed out that the P/E ratio of the IT industry is between 30 and 40 times, and the stock price of Wansu Technology far exceeds the reasonable valuation. The P/E ratio of NetEase Science and Technology corresponds to 52 times the earnings of 2009. Thus, many brokers also have a neutral rating for the company in their reports, not expecting the stock price to rise in the future. Business reporter Chen Jie\"]\n"

      "['西蒙,黄海军,黄总,黄总监', '正向', 'Simon switch has nearly a hundred patents and 12 quality assurance procedures. SIMON Simon Electric has been in China since 1999, and has experienced nearly 10 years of stormy journey. Finally, relying on its solid and practical, united and innovative corporate style, it has established a core brand position in China\\'s low-voltage electrical industry, and continues to write brilliance on the vast land of 9.6 million square kilometers. But who could have thought that a small switch would have nearly a hundred patents and so many high-tech innovations. With a sense of curiosity, the reporter came to the Asian production base of SIMON Siemens Electrical in Hai\\'an, Jiangsu, to interview Mr. Huang Haijun, the deputy general manager and manufacturing director of Siemens Electrical (China) Co., Ltd., which gave us a deeper understanding of SIMON Siemens Electrical\\'s exquisite craftsmanship, rigorous work process, and innovative production technology. Reporter: Mr. Huang, hello! Have you heard that since Simon Electric was founded in Spain in 1916, it has completed more than ten large-scale successful acquisitions around the world after more than ninety years of development. Can you tell us how Simon Electric\\'s factory layout is in various countries around the world? Mr. Huang: Hahaha, after nearly a century of development, Simon Electric has established more than 20 companies in more than ten countries, including Spain, China, India, Russia, France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and so on. Among them, 12 are overseas production bases. Currently, China is the largest overseas production base and R&D center. The products cover more than a dozen fields, including low-voltage, electrical accessories, smart buildings, lighting appliances, and comprehensive cabling, and the sales network is also distributed in more than 50 countries and regions across four continents. The reporter: Since Simon Electric entered China in 1999, it is said that the Spanish headquarters has invested a lot of manpower and material resources to build a world-class large laboratory and first-class research and development team. Can you elaborate on the prospects and goals of today\\'s China R&D center? Mr. Huang: The XiShen Electrical China R&D Center was established in 2003 and has grown to a certain scale so far. The prospects and goals of the R&D center in China mainly manifest in the following aspects: the first is to achieve globalization. Last year, Simon Electric\\'s board of directors did some research in China and believed that the Chinese market was stronger in terms of talent, product, and technology development. China was determined to provide R&D services for Siemens\\' globalization. The second is to develop a complete solution towards energy conservation and environmental protection, and intelligence, providing a comprehensive solution for customers and users, including low-voltage electrical appliances, integrated cabling, switches, lighting fixtures, etc. Third is my personal expectation, hoping to apply to become a provincial research center of Jiangsu Province after a period of effort, and create a high-level provincial research center under the premise of complying with Chinese policies. The reporter: For switches and sockets, ordinary consumers may think that there is no technology content. Do you have any suggestions? Could you talk to us about some of the technological innovations Simon has made in the field of switches? Mr. Huang: Of course! For most consumers, it may really think that the switch socket has no high-tech content. But if we look at it from the perspective of professional manufacturing, there are actually many secrets that are unknown to people hidden in it. For example, the application of our Simon switch\\'s unique patent technologies, such as the sliding-free rocker structure, child lock, and high-performance current-carrying components, can ensure that our switches and sockets are safer and more reliable than similar products. For example, the design without sliding rocker can effectively reduce the generation of arcs. Ordinary users may not feel the obvious difference, but in a humid environment, such as the kitchen and bathroom, the advantage is immediately apparent. Our Simon products not only have nearly a hundred patents in R&D, but also have 12 quality assurance processes in production. Our switch has been flicked more than 40,000 times, and the socket has been plugged and unplugged more than 15,000 times, and it can be used normally for 12 years and has passed CCC certification, fully complying with the Chinese electrical accessory standards. Journalist: With so many kinds of switches and sockets on the market, can you give us some professional advice on how to choose the right switches and sockets? Mr. Huang: With pleasure! First, you need to look carefully and see if it has a luster, whether it fades, and whether the craftsmanship is exquisite; This is not over, you also need to see if the material is all PC material, because this material has many advantages such as high strength and good flame retardancy; Secondly, it is the feel, generally, the switches with good materials, such as using high-quality PC materials and better internal copper parts, the feel of the switch socket is heavier; When you use your hand to move it, you can feel its strength, light and not tight, spring hard; and the poor switches, its spring is soft, easy to get stuck in the middle, the panel feels thin and brittle when pressed with your hand; Finally, listen to its sound, whether the rhythm is strong and crisp. Generally, a good switch has a brighter sound, while a poor switch is relatively dull, and the sound is not pure when it is turned, with an intermittent state in the middle. The reporter: Just now, you talked about the difference between the good and bad switch, it seems that the key raw material selection is the most important for the Simon switch socket. How do we formulate the raw material standards for Simon switch sockets? Mr. Huang: In the selection of product raw materials, we adhere to our rigorous style. The first requirement is for performance to be safe and reliable, and the second is for energy conservation and environmental protection. Now the two main materials are plastic and copper tape. On the one hand, we require our raw material suppliers to be safe and reliable, and on the other hand, we are responsible for the environment and society. Simon takes into account the responsibility to the environment and society while providing quality assurance to customers. Journalist: Everyone says that \"advanced technology and scientific process are the prerequisites for quality.\" How does Simon ensure the quality in the management and implementation of the process design flow for its lighting products? Mr. Huang: We have the following requirements for the product process: one, standardized process flow; two, efficient production methods; three, stable production process; four, sustainable development, continuous improvement. Simon\\'s product process design has a strict standard process, which is the requirement of Simon\\'s production system. It provides a comprehensive and systematic consideration for all aspects of production processes, equipment matching, and quality process control. The reporter said that Simon Electric now has world-class professional equipment and is at the forefront of the industry. In addition to introducing foreign equipment, we have also independently developed automated assembly lines suitable for the production of Simon switches and sockets. Can you give a brief introduction to the advanced equipment we currently have? Mr. Huang: The main production line equipment includes injection molding machines, which mainly introduce imported equipment and are equipped with automated tools. In addition, there are self-developed equipment, and a department was established in 2003 to research automated production equipment. In the automation production of switch sockets, some large-scale automated production lines were developed first, and the pace of automation transformation has been constantly accelerating. Currently, Siemens Electrical has pioneered an automatic assembly line that has basically achieved automatic feeding of all plastic parts and metal components, installation of protective door components, multi-axis screw tightening, and the assembly of upper and lower shells. These self-developed and automated production equipment have several advantages: first, they are more targeted and better suited to the production characteristics of the product. Second, urgency. Now emphasizing flexible production, Simon switch varieties are about 4000, and the cost of introducing different equipment is very high, and independent research and development can also better solve this problem. Third, sustainability. Devices developed through independent research can be continuously improved to meet different requirements. There are also high-performance automated equipment in the production of electronic products. Simon\\'s investment in technology has great reference value in the industry. The reporter asked: We found that the shelf life of electronic products in the industry is one year, but Simon\\'s electronic products have a shelf life of two years. Does Simon have internal control requirements that are significantly higher than national and industry inspection standards in terms of quality control? Mr. Huang: Yes. The warranty period for electronic products and household appliances in the industry is generally one year, and repairs after one year will incur certain costs. Simon can guarantee unconditional maintenance for two years. Based on several aspects: first, the quality planning of the system, including the entire process of product design and manufacturing, procurement, through quality planning, clarify the quality control key points, methods, specific requirements and control plan of the whole process of product realization; second, there is a high-standard laboratory, equipped with various advanced testing equipment, focusing on the quality analysis, routine testing and supervision of the product, at the same time, maintain good communication and cooperation with relevant national industry testing institutions, to participate in the study, analysis and revision of relevant industry technical standards, to ensure the leading position of SIMON electrical products in the industry technology; third, the control of the entire production process is very strict, and the quality control of each link is strictly managed. For important electronic products, we also record and retain all performance parameters at the time of each product\\'s factory release to ensure traceability. In case of problems, we can find the cause in a timely and accurate manner. The reporter: As you know, LED lamps have become a hot topic in the switch lighting industry, and I believe Simon Electric will also have big moves in LED lamps. Don\\'t know if Mr. Huang can tell us about Simon\\'s situation in LED lamps? Mr. Huang: The research of LED lights by XiShen Electric (China) has been going on for one or two years, and the products have only been launched recently. In line with the trend of internationalization, we established an LED lamp factory last year and made LED lamps an important research direction. During the period from last year to this year, the initial products have been successively developed, but have not yet been mass-produced and launched. From the annual dealer conference just held, it can be seen that some LED products have been launched for conventional and traditional lamps such as recessed lights, ceiling lights, and flat lights. However, Simon\\'s focus on LED is more on the application of technology rather than research and development. The company will expand its R&D team in the future to make LED R&D a main direction, and launch more products.']\n"

Chief reporter Shen Kun, after observing the performance of 41 players in four rounds of training, has compiled a list of 26 players for the final preparatory stage. Almost a quarter of the players on this list are from Shanghai Shenhua, and all six players who participated in the three-day flight training last week have been selected.

And Wang Tong, a young player from Ronglu, only participated in two training sessions during the fourth training camp.

They sent me to be a representative to inspect!\" Wang Yang, who plays for Sint-Truiden in Belgium, was suspected of being excluded from the team because of his poor performance in the friendly match against South Korea. In the end, his name was still on the list. Of the 26, about 10 players have already secured their starting positions, with only a few positions having some uncertainty, and the main uncertainty lies in the attack and the defensive midfielder. Among these \"main players\", almost half of them are Shenhua players. It includes goalkeeper Wang Daire, defender Wu Xie, midfielder Song Boxuan and defenders Cao Dìng. Although Cao Ding only participated in the fourth three-day training camp, his midfield and forward organizing ability has been recognized by head coach Lou Bu through training and matches. Not only did he score a goal for the national team in the warm-up match against East Asia, but he also passed on many dangerous passes. In the post-match interview, Lou Bu praised him. In this battle for the position of attacking midfielder, the young player from Guoan, Zhang Xizhe, ultimately lost his position and was also excluded from the final list. The center forward is still the weakest position of the Olympic team. Coach Bu brought in six center forwards this time, not only bringing back Zhang Chengdong who had just recovered from a long-term injury, but also did not reject Li Kai who was still in the suspension period, which shows the extreme shortage of this position. But Coach Bu said that the current batch of players is enough to deal with Oman. After this round of elimination, the Olympic team will continue to cast a wide net to select new players.']\n"

Sina Tech News, Beijing time, October 7th, in the evening, according to foreign media reports, JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz raised Apple's fourth quarter revenue forecast for the fiscal year 2010 from $18.13 billion to $18.71 billion, and continued to maintain a target share price of $400. Mozgovoy predicted that Apple's gross margin for the fourth quarter ending September 30 would reach 39.5%, up from the previously expected 39.2%, and could reach 40% in the next quarter. And revenue for the fiscal year 2011 will reach $81.53 billion, up from the previously expected $78.84 billion, which does not include the revenue from the Verizon version of the iPhone. There is currently news that the Verizon version of the iPhone will be launched as early as 2011. Mozgovoy said that if the report is true, the Verizon version of the iPhone could boost Apple’s earnings per share by as much as $2. Moskowitz believes that although many manufacturers have launched their own tablets, the competitiveness of the Apple iPad is still stronger than that of the iPhone. JPMorgan expects that Apple's iPad sales in the fourth quarter will reach 4.7 million units, higher than the 4.5 million units expected by ColinMcGranahan, an analyst at Bernstein Research. JPMorgan expects that tablet computers will cannibalize netbook sales to a large extent, but will not affect the sales of Apple Mac computers. On the contrary, Moscovitz also claimed that the iPad helped to boost Mac sales. (Li Ming)\"]\n"

Yesterday, a fight broke out at the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road in the provincial city, attracting a large number of people to watch. What are you talking about? I have already told you that this is our family matter, why are you still following it up? Yesterday noon, near the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road, a man in tattered clothes shouted excitedly at another man, surrounded by many passersby, and two taxis were parked at the scene. According to Mr. Lin, a passerby, who told the reporter, the man who was cursing was a taxi driver, who had just had a fight with his wife. His wife was very fierce, rushing up and tearing at his clothes and biting him with her teeth. The man's shirt was torn to shreds, exposing a large area of his chest, and his stomach was also scratched. It is said that the couple fought because the wife suspected that the husband had an affair. Two men put on a “full-contact” fight because the husband vented his anger on another taxi driver, blaming him for taking his wife on a city-wide chase. I was so wronged. The woman said to follow the taxi in front of me after she got into my car. She said she would chase, so I just followed and chased! The taxi driver, who was being vented on, protested his innocence. In fact, the woman asked him to chase the taxi in front of him after she got into his car in Honggutan. So, he chased all the way to Nanchang Bridge, then to Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road. After circling around Hongcheng Market, he finally caught up at the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road. After catching up, the farce began.

The Rockets' coach, Rick Adelman, is also a candidate for the coach of the year award. LeBron James is still at the top of the MVP list. Sina Sports News, March 17, 2010: ESPN columnist Maurice Brooks updated the season award candidates. Among the MVP candidates, LeBron James is still at the top, and Houston Rockets' Aaron Brooks has the chance to compete with his former teammate, Carl Landry, for the most improved player award. Rockets' coach Rick Adelman also has the chance to win the coach of the year award. 1. LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) 2. Kevin Durant (Oklahoma Thunder) If this player, who is only 21 years old, can defeat James and take the top spot in the scoring list, he will become the youngest scoring champion in NBA history. 3. Kobe Bryant (Los Angeles Lakers) is a leader with the ability to win the MVP award, and the fact is that Kobe has already completed 7 game-winning shots in this season. 4. Dirk Nowitzki (Dallas Mavericks) After the Mavericks won 13 consecutive games, I am sure that no one would have thought that the New York Knicks would be the first team to stop their winning streak. Nowitzki contributed 20 points and 12 rebounds in this game, but still could not make up for the huge disadvantage in the first half. 5. Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets) scored 45 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in his personal game, but still lost to the Houston Rockets. Anthony has scored over 40 points in 7 games this season. 6. Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic) His defense is as good as the offensive of other scoring machines, as Stan Van Gundy, the head coach, said that Howard can affect the opponent's every offensive on the defensive end. 7. Deron Williams (Utah Jazz) He has already achieved 35 double-doubles this season, including 5 in his last 6 games. After defeating the Washington Wizards this week, the Jazz are only 2 games behind the Nuggets. 8. Steve Nash (Phoenix Suns) Nash, who won the MVP award for two consecutive seasons in the past, is now playing his 1000th game. Although his body has been running for a long time, he still played one of the best seasons of his career. 9. Dwyane Wade (Miami Heat) contributed 30.6 points, 7.9 assists and 5 rebounds per game in the recent 6-1 run. 10. Brandon Roy (Portland Trail Blazers) was temporarily ranked outside the top 10 because of 14 games missed due to injury, but his performance after returning to the court may not be reflected in the Trail Blazers' record. The Most Improved Player Award 1. Aaron Brooks (Houston Rockets) It is unknown whether the Rockets' PR department has started to plan some activities to support Brooks' selection as the Most Improved Player Award, but his performance against the Nuggets is definitely a good start. 2. Marc Gasol (Memphis Grizzlies) When mentioning Gasol, you can't help mentioning Zach Randolph, it is uncertain whether the two big shots of the Grizzlies are willing to share this honor together. 3. Carl Landry (Sacramento Kings) is a third-year player who has set new career highs in all statistical categories. 4. Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks) The young center, who was just named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, has already achieved 32 double-doubles this season. 5. Josh Smith (Atlanta Hawks) He made great progress last season, so is it possible for a player who made great mental progress to win the award for Most Improved Player? Defensive Player of the Year 1. Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic) We all know what Howard's strengths are. When he is on the court, the opponents often give up the inside attack. 2. Ron Artest (Los Angeles Lakers) was criticized for being a bit old and declining in strength, but he is still the best perimeter defender in the league. 3. Gerald Wallace (Charlotte Hornets) When Wallace is on the court, he may be the most miserly defender in the league. 4. Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks) He is the second highest shot blocker in the league and a contender for the Most Improved Player award. 5. Josh Smith (Atlanta Hawks) and Anderson Varejão (Cleveland Cavaliers). The Celtics have already tasted the bitterness that Varejão brought to their defense. Coach of the Year 1. Scott Brooks (Oklahoma Thunder) The Thunder have won five consecutive games thanks to their excellent defense. 2. Scott Skiles (Milwaukee Bucks) They have now won 2 more games than the total wins of last season. 3. Nate McMillan (Portland Trail Blazers) His selection may be due to the fact that the Trail Blazers are in the most competitive division in the league. 4. Larry Brown (Charlotte Bobcats) His team has won 6 consecutive games, and the Bobcats have won 24 home games this season, breaking the club record. In the remaining season, the Bobcats only need to win 2 more games to break the record for the most wins in a season. 5. Lionel Hollins (Memphis Grizzlies) and Rick Adelman (Houston Rockets), although the two coaches' teams are unlikely to make the playoffs, the two teams that were not expected to do well at the beginning of the season have won more than 50% of their games.

      "['武夷山,A君,老赵,夫子,小丽,Taylor,佩利,游溪,游九曲,艄公,肖,肖师傅,肖老师傅', '正向', 'From Wuyi Mountain in Fujian to NanSha in Guangzhou, the Southern Tour of Three Provinces and Three Golf Courses for those of us who are addicted to green opium, traveling around China to visit golf courses has become an addiction that can\\'t be kicked. Like women who often shop in groups, people who play sports have their own little circles. I met A and Old Zhao through playing ball, and we have been accustomed to traveling together every year when the weather is still nice. Master was a ball friend who chatted about basketball online, we had been in touch for a long time without meeting in person. When it comes to late spring, April and May, it is the perfect time to play golf in the south. Talking about this with you all, we hit it off immediately. Go south to fight? Where do you want to play? Yunnan, Guangdong, Hainan… everywhere is a place that can\\'t be let go. After a few people got together, they decided to go on a southern tour from southeast to southwest (they did not go to the southwest for some reason), and have a four-person version of the Southern Journey. Playing ball is the main thing, appreciating the scenery is the secondary thing, how can it not be pleasant! Then, we set out to find the court, taking six days to travel from the starting point of Wuyishan, Fujian to the end point of Nansha, Guangzhou, walking into three provinces and three courts, truly indulging in the joy of playing basketball, and experiencing a life of free and easy like a wandering cloud and a wild crane. It was precisely: eastern travels to seek immortals, western travels to worship Buddha, northern travels to harmonize things, and southern travels to play cuju. First stop: Wuyi Mountain Scenery is everywhere. The first golf course to visit is Wuyi Mountain Scenery Golf. This basketball court, Master Fu has been to, and he praised it highly. I only visited the famous scenic spot Wuyi in Fujian years ago and I haven\\'t played there. What interests us is the business golf super value package recently launched by Wuyi Mountain. Stay for two nights, play two games, and send a buffet breakfast, and it costs more than a thousand yuan for one person. So we hurried to make a reservation. On the afternoon of April 25, when the initial meeting of Qingchu was held, A and I and Old Zhao took off from our city. The clouds were very thick, and it looked like it was going to rain soon. Arrive at Wuyi Mountain Airport in about two hours, the weather is very good, the sky is blue, and the mountains gather. As soon as I got off the plane, I saw the staff of Wuyi Mountain Scenery holding the pick-up board waiting at the exit, which was quite warm. The plane of Master was delayed, and we waited for him for nearly half an hour. He has the frankness of a northern man, tall and strong, and he is bound to be a big cannon. But Master was Master, and he started analyzing the field and the situation of this year\\'s Players Championship as soon as he got on the bus. In the midst of chatting, we arrived at the Wuyi Mountain Scenic Golf Club. Everyone knows about the quirks of the Golfers. To play a good game, you need to choose a comfortable venue first. Comfortable playing field, the most important is whether the clubhouse is eye-catching or not. The scenery of Wuyi Mountain is said to be equipped with five-star resort hotels. Standing in the clubhouse, looking around, I was surrounded by the embrace of the mountains, and the white clouds were so close that they could almost be touched with the hand. The clubhouse is humble in comparison to the natural beauty around it. The style blends traditional northern Fujian architecture with modern architecture, simple but not boring, \"elegant in a low-key way\". In the evening, after we had eaten the farm-style dishes at the Chinese restaurant, several of us sat on the terrace, sipping tea and chatting. The trees outside the house cast shadows, and we occasionally heard the sound of birds. Thinking of the ancients\\' \"seven days in the mountains, a thousand years in the world,\" we felt a deep resonance. According to the principle of relativity, living there for a thousand years would probably seem too short. On the second day of the sunny discussion of the ball, we got up early. After having the free buffet breakfast provided by the hotel, I went to the court. As there are not many courts in Fujian, there are quite a few people coming to play. Reserve a tee time at 8 am. Before each game, I have a strange illness: I will first rehearse the scene of playing in the new court in my mind. This may be the area where I need to improve the most in playing, not being calm and composed enough. Arriving at the tee, take a pre-shot group photo as usual. Looking around, the scene is ethereal, the close-up is charming, and the distant view is vast. The caddy Xiaoli told us that Wuyi Mountain scenery is a typical mountain golf course. The entire stadium covers an area of 2,480 mu. But if you take a closer look, you will find that there is always more to see beyond the mountains. The outer layer of the golf course is the most famous natural scenery of Wuyi Mountain - the magnificent and magnificent Thirty-six Peaks and the various and various Ninety-nine Rocks, standing on the tee, all the beautiful scenery can be seen. I was still in a daze, but A-kun had already started to take the ball. This driver is his latest favorite, the TaylorMade R9. This year\\'s March launch by TaylorMade, which is said to be a perfect blend of ball flight control technology and adjustable center of gravity technology, can adjust the left and right ball flight up to 75 yards. The veteran Perry has recently performed stably in various major competitions, and the media has praised this club for its great contribution. Facing a 380-yard fairway, A君 was indeed possessed by Pelly, hitting the ball straight and fast, as if he were a professional player. After the first three holes, I got a certain understanding of the characteristics of the Wuyi Mountain scenery. It is said that the scenery at the peak is the most beautiful, but conversely, the scenery that is beautiful can also be terrifying. This is a typical mountain golf course, which is also a truly natural course created with rugged and unique natural features. The fairways are built in the V-shape of the natural valley, rough and natural, with large ups and downs, endless sand traps and lakes, shrubbery obstacles and red protruding rocks unique to the Danxia landform, all of which indicate that it is a wild horse. But which golf lover doesn\\'t like \"horseracing\"? When Master reached the 5th hole, the Master, who had been serious all along, suddenly burst out laughing. \"I was tricked by the 5th hole last year. I had read the攻略on the Internet and felt confident, but when I actually got to the tee, the terrain was high and the wind was strong. When I swung the club, the force was too strong, and the ball went out of bounds.\" Standing here again, there is a psychological barrier. No. 5 hole is indeed very special. The caddy said that the tee of this fairway is very high, the elevation difference of the fairway is nearly 50 meters, and there are three sand traps around the green. From afar, it looks like large and small pearls falling into a jade plate. No.5 hole is famous for its unique scenery, and on the tee, we can see the Great King Peak, which looks like a sleeping beauty lying on her side. This time, the master learned his lesson and hit the ball with great skill. Sure enough, the ball landed on the fairway after a graceful arc, and was at the right distance from the green. He then hit it onto the green and made a light tap to get it into the hole. The ball went in, and he made a birdie to avenge his loss. Scenic views and thrills are everywhere in 18 holes. There is hardly any smooth road in this paradoxical mountain stadium. We were amazed at the level of the court as we played. The back nine is completely different in style from the front nine. The 9th hole is almost a huge natural forest barrier surrounded by mountains and forests, which is extremely challenging for every shot of the player. Especially No. 14 and No. 16 holes are daunting. No.14 fairway is a left dogleg and has a two-tier green. The fairway is dotted with large bunkers, which are challenging and difficult, and low hills surround the stream and grass, with obstacles everywhere that you cannot guard against. Without the right tools, you dare not take on this porcelain work. The 16th hole is much the same as the 14th. Symmetrical with No. 14, it is a right dogleg, and also the longest par-4 hole on the course, 443 yards in total. The terrain around the green is uneven, with sand traps and lakes with waterfalls, not only testing the basic skills of the players, but also challenging their strategy. I have been playing for several years, so I am no longer a beginner. The more difficult the hole, the more one needs to maintain a calm mindset. As soon as the ball was hit, I felt something was wrong, and sure enough, the ball was blown by the wind and rolled into the sand trap. The edge of the sand trap is quite deep, and I can\\'t find the master\\'s elegance in saving the ball. I finally crawled out with a gray face. After playing 18 holes and exhausting myself, I looked at the watch and found it was noon. Looking back, the ball friends behind were still sweating and fighting. The veteran teacher caught three birds and an eagle, and hit +4. On April 27, it was sunny. You intended to play another game in the afternoon, but it would be a pity not to see the scenery after coming to Wuyi Mountain. After lunch, we all had our fill of food and went to Xingcun on Jiuquxi to ride a bamboo raft. They say that you would come to Wuyi in vain without riding a bamboo raft. How could you ride a bamboo raft when touring the Nine Bends? It is said that the boatmen on Jiuqu Creek are famous for telling anecdotes, and missing them means missing the real folk culture of Wuyi. But there are some unwritten rules here. On the bamboo raft, it is necessary to hit a few times, otherwise the boatman will not only be silent, but also not give you a good face. To make the afternoon trip easier, we immediately gave the old boatman surnamed Xiao a tip of 50 yuan as soon as we got on the raft. A stream runs through the mountains, clear and shallow, winding around nine bends. The rocks by the stream are arranged in rock formations, and their reflections are immersed in cold green. Master Xiao is a professional, and he has been talking all the way: Jiucu溪 is the source of the Jiucu Stream, which originates from the dense forest of the Wuyi Mountain Nature Reserve, with a total length of 62.8 kilometers. The river in the scenic area, apart from natural meandering, is also controlled by the direction of multiple sets of rock layer fractures, forming a unique natural wonder of nine meanders. The Nine Bends Stream flows clear, with abundant water and water quality reaching the national Class I standard for surface water. People living nearby are like immortals. Standing on the bamboo raft, we followed the Nine Bends Stream windingly, with water running through the mountains, and saw the crystal clear stream, which was full of different interests and beautiful scenery in every bend. For more than 1000 years, the people of Wuyi Mountain have used bamboo rafts as a means of transportation. We asked Master Xiao why Wuyi Mountain still uses such primitive tools now. Master Xiao smiled and said that the bamboo raft had its own advantages. It had a large buoyancy, shallow draft, and light body, and was extremely flexible and maneuverable. He can control any situation with just a bamboo pole. It can drift smoothly over deep pools, and slide quickly down shallow riffles; it can nimbly avoid the midstream rocks, and make sharp turns. And it\\'s also more environmentally friendly. The bamboo raft floated for nearly two hours on the nine-bend river and finally arrived at the destination - Wu Yi Gong wharf on the first bend. When we were about to leave Wuyishan, we talked about the happy family package introduced by the caddie and decided to bring our wives and children together to escape the heat during the summer vacation.']\n"

      "['', '正向', 'Light rain eases drought in the US, Southwest China may face autumn drought, initial frost impact is limited, Midwest to receive light rain Last week, the Delta region, southeastern cotton belt, and northeastern US experienced heavy to torrential rain due to the impact of Tropical Storm Lee, which is beneficial to ease the local drought. But the rains came too late for the soybeans in the Delta, which will be a hindrance to the harvest. The cotton harvest in the southern and southeastern cotton belt of the United States was also interrupted. The central United States is still experiencing a lack of precipitation, with less than 25 mm of accumulated precipitation in Illinois and Indiana, while the eastern parts of Ohio and Kentucky have received more rain. Regarding temperature, there was a significant cooling in the central plains and Midwest of the United States last week, with the average temperature in these regions about 4-6°C lower than normal. However, the temperature in the Midwest was mostly maintained at around 24°C during the day and 10°C at night, and there was no initial frost. Actual accumulated precipitation map for the United States from September 5 to 12. This week, the weather in the central United States was basically good, although there may be frost in some areas, but it is expected to have little impact. Affected by cold air, a cooling process occurred from north-central to southeast of the United States. It is expected that parts of North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and even Iowa may experience the first frost of the season on the night of the 14th and 15th. Since the corn is nearly mature, the potential frost threat is mainly to the US soybean crop. However, 16 days later, the central United States will experience a rise in temperature, and the rise in temperature is expected to continue until next Monday, and the mid-term forecast suggests that most of the northern United States will have higher temperatures than normal from September 18 to 22. While temperatures cool, the chance of precipitation in the US Midwest this week will increase, which will improve soil moisture conditions and benefit soybean pod filling and maturation. Although the weather was mainly light rain, the accumulated precipitation was not enough to alleviate the drought, but it could curb the development of the drought in the central and western regions. As of September 6, the area of drought in the United States is shrinking, and the area of drought in the central and western regions continues to increase slightly, but the degree of drought is basically maintained at moderate drought. The drought situation in the Midwest is likely to remain unchanged in the joint monitoring report to be released by the USDA and NOAA this Thursday. This year, the soil moisture in the US Midwest was good at the beginning of the season, and drought only began in August. Moreover, the development speed of the drought area and degree was not fast, so this drought will not have a significant impact on the new crop soybeans. With the arrival of the \"three autumn busy season\" in China, the southwest region experienced a continuous drought from the autumn to the autumn since September, and the majority of the agricultural areas in China welcomed the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing of the \"three autumn busy season\". Currently, the development period of most autumn crops in the country is normal, and it is expected to be harvested on time. However, some parts of southern North China and the Yellow River Basin may be slightly delayed. Most of the winter wheat and rape planting areas have favorable meteorological conditions for autumn sowing and the growth of winter wheat and rape, but drought in some areas may affect agricultural production. First, the weather for autumn harvest in Northeast China is basically good, and the future local frost will have a slight impact on the yield of soybeans, corn, and one-season rice. During the early part of September, most of the northeastern region was mainly sunny with adequate sunshine. Although local precipitation was less than normal, leading to meteorological drought, the soil moisture in most of the agricultural areas was suitable, which was conducive to the grain filling and maturation of crops. The temperature was slightly lower than normal, and the northern part of Heilongjiang Province experienced the first frost at the end of the month, but it had little impact on the grain crops. Starting from the 14th, a strong cold air will successively affect most parts of our country from the northwest to the southeast. Among them, the temperature drop in some parts of the northern part of the North China region and the northern part of the Northeast region can exceed 10℃. From the 15th to the 18th, local areas in the northern and western parts of Heilongjiang will experience frost again. The cooling will affect the grain filling and maturation speed of autumn crops such as corn in North China, soybeans in Northeast China, and one-season rice, but the threat to production is limited as there is no frost in the main agricultural areas. Secondly, the northern winter wheat area has had abundant rainfall this year, with good soil moisture at the beginning of the season, and the prospects for wheat sowing are optimistic. In the upper part of September, the northern winter wheat area experienced continuous overcast and rainy weather with less sunshine, leading to soil moisture that was slightly higher than normal, which was not conducive to the grain filling and maturity of the previous crop corn and soybeans, and the pod opening and fiber shedding of cotton. The harvest period may be delayed. But it is still more comforting that the soil is slightly wet rather than dry, after all, autumn rains in the northern winter wheat areas are often scarce. It is expected that after the 18th, the North China and Huang-Huai regions will return to clear weather, which will help to reduce soil moisture and alleviate the problem of excessive soil moisture. Winter wheat is expected to be sown in a timely manner in the lower part of September. Finally, the situation of the southern rape production areas has diverged, and the drought in the southwestern region continues. Most of the soil moisture conditions in the rape production areas along the Yangtze River are suitable, which is conducive to the sowing and emergence of rape. It is expected that rape will begin to be sown in mid-September. Since May, the southeastern part of Southwest China has had less precipitation, and the phased extreme high temperature weather has led to light to moderate agricultural drought in some parts of southeastern Sichuan, western Chongqing, northeastern Yunnan, eastern and southwestern Guizhou, western Hunan, and eastern Guangxi by September 12. It is expected that the southeast of Guizhou and Chongqing will still have less precipitation in autumn, and a continuous drought from summer to autumn may occur in the future, which is not conducive to the timely sowing of rape.

September 27, 2022, according to the Taiwan \"China Radio and Television News Network\" report on the 27th, more than a hundred US veterans and civil servants testified that they had seen aliens. They also said that these aliens were particularly interested in human nuclear weapons. According to these so-called \"alien witnesses\": aliens have frequently visited the earth in the past fifty years. According to their testimony, UFOs have appeared in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Iran. Some even claim to have seen the remains of a UFO and living or dead aliens. A witness said that in 1967, when he was serving at an air force base in Montana, he saw a UFO fly to the base and hover in the air. At that time, all ten义勇兵 nuclear warheads of the base were失效.

      "['肖青龙,王绪林,刘晓农,张雄,吴小源', '负向', '30 days made the CBA promotion slots dramatically change. Fenglu had no chance to complain. The possibility of a third Guangdong team in the new season CBA has become 0. Guangdong Fenglu Aluminum Materials Team lost to Tianjin Ronggang Team in this competition, and was completely out of CBA. The CBA Joint Conference had determined the promotion criteria for the 2008-2009 season CBA League in May this year, mainly using the results of this year\\'s NBL League as the hardware indicators for promotion. But at the joint conference held yesterday, it was decided by voting. The result is that the Guangdong Fenglu, which won the NBL championship this year, was defeated by Tianjin and Qingdao, which were behind it in the ranking - 16 CBA club general managers and the league office of the Basketball Management Center voted. Tianjin ranked first with 10 votes, Qingdao got 6 votes, and Fenglu, which was previously the most popular, only got 1 vote. The Tianjin Ronggang Club with the highest number of votes was promoted to CBA. Fenglu\\'s vice general manager Xiao Qinglong, who attended the joint conference in Beijing, said that the club had foreseen the result. According to Xiao Qinglong, some CBA club presidents joked with him the day before yesterday when he went to Beijing to attend this joint meeting that \"Your Fengleng (promoting A) is out of the question!\" Xiao Qinglong said that he felt something was wrong with the situation at the time, and he had also communicated with the headquarters, but he did not expect that the rumors that had spread the day before would come true at the joint meeting the next day. When the reporter interviewed Wang Xulin, the head coach of Fenglun team by phone, he also got this confirmation, \"I and all the players heard yesterday that our team may not be promoted.\" Wang Xulin’s disappointment was clearly audible over the phone: \"When the CBA Association came to our club for the CBA admission assessment on August 4, they said that they were satisfied with all of our hardware and software. At that time, I even asked Liu Xiaonong, the Party Secretary of the Basketball Management Center, and Zhang Xiong, the Director of the CBA League Office, who both said that there was no problem with our promotion. Who would have thought that we would end up in this situation.\" Although the Fenglv team has been training since August 1, the failure of the team to upgrade may cause these players from all over the country to go their separate ways. Last night, Chairman Wu Xiaoyuan, who was at the San Shui base of the club, had already clearly stated that the possibility of Fenglun withdrawing from the Chinese basketball league cannot be ruled out in the future after listening to the report from the front.']\n"

Journalist Shen Zhiyu reported from Shanghai. After staying awake all night and the lights were still on in the gambling city of Macao, the \"Dream Eight\" arrived in Yao Ming\\'s city two hours later. This is no longer a small place, the population here is 30 times that of Macao, the Huangpu River flows slowly through the heart of the city, like the blood of Shanghai, infusing this city with the charm of civilization, the Oriental Pearl and the City God Temple, Pudong and Puxi, connecting a thousand years of civilization. The American big men have yet to make their mark in history. The first thing that caught the eye was the magnificent Pudong Airport, which also amazed them. Brian McKinnon, the NBA public relations manager who came to China for the first time, said with wide eyes, \"The airport is really beautiful. Is this airport newly built?\" The staff played the fans because there was no special aircraft, and could only take a commercial airliner from Macau to Shanghai. At around 1:00 PM, the US team boarded Shanghai Airlines flight FM818 and headed straight for Pudong, Shanghai. At 3:30, the plane landed steadily at Pudong International Airport. Step out of the cabin, and you can see the thick Olympic atmosphere. Five Fuwa are smiling at this group of giants. The Beijing Olympic logo can be seen everywhere in the aisle. Howard said with a big smile, \"I am really excited.\" More excited than them were the staff at the airport. At Pudong Airport, they did not meet the fans and did not see the slogans, so the staff temporarily played this role. When Kobe, James, Anthony, and Wade passed by them one after another, these prepared staff members put aside their usual reserve and seriousness, ran up to them, and asked for photos and autographs from these NBA superstars. Then, after a long circuit, the US team got on the bus to head to the Borland Hotel, which was where they were staying, to meet the needs of these temporary fans. Along the way, the large bus drove on the wide and flat roads of Pudong, and all that could be seen were skyscrapers like those in the center of New York and Chicago, which filled them with admiration. Those who have been to China know well what kind of city Shanghai is, and those who have not been to China are amazed at such prosperity. The coach arrived at the Portland Hotel in 45 minutes. Unloading luggage, getting room cards, entering the room, the minute hand slowly approached 6 o\\'clock. The training session could not be skipped, and at around 7:00, they walked out of the room, got on the bus, and headed to Jingan Sports Center. Jingan Sports Center is actually right next to the Plaza Hotel, but the big stars of the US team could not walk over, so they drove around and entered the sports center. There are no professional fans here, but there are also temporary ones. The policeman in uniform was excitedly holding a small camera and standing on the sideline, pressing it again and again, smiling happily at the American team who was practicing shooting baskets.']\n"

And this is the latest news on Potato\\'s IPO filing since last November. The PR department of T土豆网 stated yesterday that it was inconvenient to comment on this matter. The sharp decline of the pre-listing Chinese stocks shocked the industry and made many industry insiders believe that the window for going public in the US had closed.

Li Yan, a spokesperson for Tudou, told the reporter that as of now, Tudou has not yet announced the price range, and the possibility of listing in the near future is small. It was previously reported that Tuhao would delay its IPO until November.

Sina Entertainment News [News] In late 2008, the most eye-catching dance king album - Roy Chiao\\'s \"The Legend of the Trendy Man\" was launched with great success, and immediately became the champion of various hit charts, including major record sales, online and new media play hit charts. With the competition for the year-end popular idol to release a new album, Luo Zhixiang has been walking through the wind and rain, and has worked hard to promote the new film. In order to thank everyone for supporting him, Golden Wind Records decided to release a reissue album at the beginning of the new year in 2009. Not only did they offer two CDs to show their sincerity and thank everyone for their support, but they also sent many gifts, such as a huge poster for the cool man, a [cool man postcard], etc. This is a super large size luxury hardcover gift, which is unique and can\\'t be missed! ! Roger\\'s first lyrics were deeply moving, \"Write a Song for You\". It was once pirated and leaked. In addition to the 10 new songs that play with the trend in the album, this version, Roger specially added a song of his own creation for a year, invited his musical talent friend Cao Ge to write the lyrics, and added his first personal lyrics, expressing his true feelings, for the fans who have supported him all along and who he loves most, because no matter when and where, he can feel the warmth of their care and protection, hoping to convey his love through this song, without words, just hum the melody, and communicate with Roger\\'s true heart. Since the illegal pirates had once put the song on the Internet for free trial listening and downloading, in order to punish this immoral behavior, before the release of \"The Legend of the Cool Guy\", Lao Zhi Xiang had to cut this song and exclude it from the album, which can be regarded as the most painful loss of his career in 2008. This time, \"Write a Song for You\" is included in the re-edited album. Roger\\'s wish is very simple. \"My fans have always said that I have never written a song for them. I never expected to write a song for them, but I encountered the situation of piracy and leakage. However, no matter what, I want to feel that my heart and heart are together with my fans. And this kind of emotion is also what I want to sing out very much! A collection of Lo Zixiang\\'s cool male fashion looks was staged on the black and white piano keys. During the launch period, it set a good record, and the sales boom also continued to the lunar new year. He specially asked the record company to add a thoughtful gift to the revised product to thank everyone. Therefore, this version was specially added 5 cool male postcards and a huge poster in a set. Collect all the cool male looks in this album. Therefore, Little Pig worked harder to promote this album in various programs, and told the whole world more prominently that this album was his most participated and most creative new work. On the cover of the difficult remaster album, Luo Zhixiang\\'s toes are on the antique piano, cool and handsome to the extreme. As soon as the cover was revealed, he shouted, \"This photo is not a digital composite!\" Originally, this new look came from Heavenly King Luo\\'s sudden inspiration. The record company thought it was very good and carefully adopted it. They did not expect that it would be extremely difficult to shoot! The antique piano under Zixiang Luo\\'s feet has a history of more than a hundred years and needs special care. In order to achieve the creative effect of playing the piano with the toes, Luo Zixiang must shift the center of gravity of his whole body to above the chest. In order to prevent injuries caused by falling off the piano, the record company also made many safety measures to ensure his safety. It is not difficult to see from the finished design that the difficulty of this costume. The perfect King Luo fell on the piano over ten times, and only felt satisfied, \"In fact, every time the shooting was very hard, very tired. Although this creative idea was proposed by me, when it was really shot, I was still quite reluctant. Can this really be shot? When it was finally completed, I was still moved, it seems that there is nothing that can\\'t be done in the world as long as you dare to try! \"']\n"

This year\\'s paint market is relatively cold, and the demand is shrinking significantly, which is the feeling of most paint people. However, in fact, it is not so. The shrinkage may be in one or more channels, and the lost share is shifting to engineering, furniture, and other channels. Overall, the market is still there, but the channels and consumption trends have changed a lot. Companies with strong market insight and sensitivity will definitely have a promising \"money prospect\" by transforming themselves quickly with their own strength. Caris漆 caught the change in the market situation. At the mid-year training meeting of Caris in the second quarter of 2011, General Manager Zhang Wenhui of Caris proposed the profit doubling model of 3+3 sticky marketing on the Purple Light Avenue, clearly pointing out that Caris\\' focus in the future will gradually shift to the development of three-dimensional channels, and will take the development of engineering channels and furniture channels as the way for Caris to expand its channels, fighting with full force. Previously, Carries had demonstrated its ability to expand its channels. On August 2, Galleries漆 successfully won the interior wall decoration project of Shanxi Province Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital. On July 30, Jalis succeeded in winning the urban and rural renovation project in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, and all the buildings on the streets of Huguan County will use Jalis exterior paint. On July 29, the Bird\\'s Nest Sports Hall in Jining City, Shandong Province decided to use Jialishi interior latex paint... Recently, the Jialishi paint engineering paint channel is continuing to create brilliance and create a three-dimensional channel growth point. During this period, Jalis Furniture Paint was no less impressive, relying on its good raw material and technical cooperation with many world chemical giants such as Rohm and Haas, Bayer, BASF, DuPont, etc., importing environmental protection resins and other raw auxiliary materials, strong technical research and development, full automatic production process and other seven product technology advantages, and seven support policies: product policy support, personnel support, service standards, special price system, interest subsidy, hardware support, training support, and strategic partners were reached with Yunhe Wood Doors, Lianfa Furniture, Anju Yan Kai Furniture Decoration, Baoxiang Furniture, Bethlehem Furniture Co., Ltd., Changfu Solid Wood, Changsheng Furniture, Changhong Furniture, Changhong Furniture Factory, Dalihua Furniture Co., Ltd., Dashangzhuang Furniture, and Dek Furniture Co., Ltd.']\n"

      "['郭洪钧,王云汉', '正向', \"The CPI has been released, and most agricultural products have fallen. In the early morning of the 15th, the domestic commodity market showed a divided trend, with most agricultural products falling, while cotton and sugar turned red. The basic metals and energy chemicals maintained an overall fluctuating and bullish trend. CPI data is lower than market expectations, and the expectation of tight monetary policy has declined. It is expected that the market will continue to fluctuate in the short term. The National Bureau of Statistics announced on the 15th that the year-on-year increase of CPI in January was 4.9%. Up 1.0% month-over-month. PPI in January rose 6.6% year on year and 0.9% month on month. Guo Hongjun, the director of the research institute of Haitong Futures, said that the CPI data was lower than the market's expectation, which reduced the expectation of tightening policies and was beneficial to the stock market. The impact on the trend of primary commodities is neutral in the short term and favorable in the long term. However, on the 15th, the National Information Center said in a report that, as part of a policy mix to fight inflation and curb asset bubbles, the PBOC is likely to continue raising interest rates and reserve requirement ratios this year. The National Information Center said that to control the total amount of liquidity, adjusting the reserve requirement ratio is the People’s Bank of China’s preferred tool, and that the reserve requirement ratio may be raised to around 23% in the future. Currently, the reserve requirement ratio in China is 19%. The National Information Center also said that further interest rate hikes by the central bank were inevitable, as interest rate hikes could effectively curb asset price bubbles. The National Information Center also expects the RMB to continue to appreciate gradually in 2011. On February 15, a national temporary storage edible oil bidding trading meeting was held at Anhui Grain Wholesale Trading Market and its networked markets. This time, 99,626 tons of rapeseed oil were planned for sale, with actual transactions of 92,759 tons, a transaction rate of 93.11%, and an average transaction price of 9,688 yuan per ton. The auction saw a further increase in the rate of success and a significant rise in the average price. The rate of success for the rapeseed oil auction on January 18 was 89%, with an average price of 9,365 yuan per ton. With the rise of the futures and spot prices of the early vegetable oil market, the auction floor price of rapeseed oil has a greater appeal to the market. Since October 2010, the state has released a total of 7 batches of temporary storage rapeseed oil, with a planned sales volume of 894,000 tons, and the actual transaction volume is 772,000 tons, with a transaction rate of 86.4%, effectively increasing the supply of market fats and oils. Today's rapeseed oil auction was well received, supporting the rapeseed oil price in the futures market, and its performance was stronger than that of soybean oil and palm oil.

However, the domestic drought concerns and strong demand continue to support prices, but the selling pressure at high levels will increase, and it is expected that the fluctuations of continuous corn will intensify. Early morning trading of soybean oil futures fluctuated slightly lower. The main 1109 contract opened at 10,792 yuan per ton and closed at 10,818 yuan per ton, down 22 yuan per ton. The overnight US bean futures saw a high adjustment, and the ex-pen market's supporting effect on the domestic oil market weakened. But the domestic price is lower than the import cost price, which restrains the downward pressure on domestic oils. Although the upward trend in the market has not changed, the risk of short-term correction still exists. Palm oil futures traded in a range at high levels in the morning session. The main contract opened at 10,088 yuan/ton and closed at 10,118 yuan/ton, down 28 yuan/ton. Malaysian palm oil and US soybean futures both showed a high adjustment trend, and the supporting effect of the foreign market weakened. But the futures price was relatively less vulnerable to decline under the severe impact of port cargo concentration and the inverted import cost and futures price. The trend shows that the upward pattern is still intact, but due to the lack of new momentum to push it up, the long and short funds are in a stalemate at the current price level, with a certain risk of a pullback, but the expected amplitude is not large.

And now you can confirm it right at your doorstep, saving both time and effort.

It is understood that this is the first time that the city's admissions office has set up a postgraduate examination information confirmation point at the Agricultural University, and it is also the first opening of the on-site confirmation of the postgraduate examination in Qingdao in 2011. Lack of experience in the past, we were not bold enough to set so many points.

[Sina Game exclusive, please indicate the source when reprinting] Sina Game\\'s exclusive review: Innovation concept has always been emphasized in the development of online games, but there has been no substantial progress. The Magic God\\'s Transmission this time proposed the slogan of \"micro-innovation\", and made subtle adjustments in terms of profession setting, skill release, and client size compared to mainstream games. Whether these settings are in line with the players\\' habitual operation habits and experience, and whether they can meet the players\\' game needs, remains to be observed. Sina Games News, June 1, 2019, Sichuan Digital Publishing Media\\'s online game company, Sky Online, announced on June 1, 2019 that it will launch a 2.5D war online game, \"The Legend of Demons,\" in the near future. The game, with micro-innovation as its concept, launches a play mode with three strong combat professions without cooldowns, no bar reading, and limited play. The game is expected to be closed beta tested in the summer vacation. It is revealed that the Heaven Online\\'s \"God Legend\" launched this time is a 2.5D game with 3D engine, which claims to be easier for players to operate while maintaining the quality of the picture. The game emphasizes PK combat gameplay, with all skills instantly released, no cooldowns or bars, and instant recovery of potions with no delays. The game will feature camp confrontation, PK competition, clan battlefield, and national war, highlighting the combat experience. According to the official introduction, the production concept of Magic God Transmission emphasizes \"micro-innovation\". In addition to the setting of instant skill release, the game is also different from the traditional multi-profession setting. The Magic God\\'s Legend abandoned the waste material profession and only adopted three strong combat professions - warrior, mage, and archer - to highlight the status and characteristics of each profession, without setting up a useless role. It is reported that the \"God Legend\" will launch a 100 MB client to improve the player experience. The game is expected to launch its first technical closed beta this summer. Chengdu Skye Online was established by the Sichuan Publishing Group, and its other online game, Iron Blood Heart, has just started public testing recently.

Jia Kue Ay attempted suicide in mid-September, with reports suggesting that it was due to her boyfriend from outside the industry being arrested. Recently, Jiahu has been having a series of bad luck. The Asahi Entertainment Weekly, which broke the news, said that Ayai Kakeuchi signed a filming contract with a large AV company, and there was a rumor that one hundred million yen was the advance payment for filming, but there were also rumors that the work had already been completed. However, if no work has even been filmed, the company is unlikely to pay the advance payment in advance, so it is very likely that the AV work starring Ayai Kakeuchi has already been completed. But the AV agency responded to the matter by saying, \"There was indeed such a plan (referring to signing with Ayami Kase), but it had not yet reached the stage of signing.\" Earlier, Aiy\\'s boyfriend, who lived with her, was arrested for attempted harassment after collecting debts. A few days later, it was reported that she had cut her wrists and taken a large amount of sleeping pills, fortunately, she was not in danger of her life. There has never been a break in the news about Ayai Kaya shooting AV works. Last year, it was rumored that she would shoot AV with Aikawa Maki, a former member of the Morning Musume, but no AV works of hers have been released. Gakki also replied to this message on Twitter in July, saying, \"How could that be, you idiot!\" Refused to deny this possibility. Morning Musume is a popular Japanese group, and each member has been popular at some point. However, negative news about the original Morning Musume has been frequently reported in recent times, apart from Ayaka Kajiwara, Masaki Nishikido\\'s career has also been unsuccessful, her brother was arrested and her mother committed suicide; Erika Yoshizawa\\'s brother died in a car accident; Saika Shuya divorced...

      "['周玲', '负向', 'Shanghai dealers refused to sell Nokia yesterday, according to the Oriental Morning Post reporter Zhou Ling. Nokia responded: it has no contractual relationship with \"speculative merchants\". Yesterday, some Shanghai dealers, who were called \"speculative merchants\" (those who did not sign contracts with Nokia) by Nokia, raised a banner saying \"refusing to sell Nokia\" in the Horizon Communication Building near Shanghai Railway Station. The reporters learned that the protest did not receive support from any official Nokia dealer, which seemed a bit weak and not very powerful. In fact, the protest banners were taken down by the property security shortly after they were hung yesterday, and the early morning reporter was also prohibited from taking photos on the scene, making the atmosphere tense. A dealer told the press yesterday that putting it up for sale was already a gesture, and that sales of Nokia products had not yet completely stopped, but that the next step would be to gradually reduce the sales of Nokia products. But a dealer boss who participated in the protest complained to the press yesterday that the dealers in Jinan and other places had received support from Nokia’s official dealers, but in Shanghai, where Nokia put pressure, not a single official dealer came out to support the protest. A formal dealer is an agent who has signed a contract with Nokia. According to Nokia\\'s channel management model, the first level is the regional general agent (referred to as FD), and below FD is the second level development agent (referred to as WKA). WKA will then develop small dealers without contractual relationships, which Nokia also refers to as \"grey market dealers\". In response to the recent frequent protests by local small dealers against Nokia\\'s heavy punishment for \"channel stuffing\", Nokia issued an official statement, saying that these \"channel stuffers\" have no contractual relationship with Nokia and no business relationship, so Nokia has no way to fine them. According to the information obtained by the journalist, Nokia\\'s penalty process is indeed to deduct the penalty directly from the local FD\\'s rebate, but the FD will pass on the penalty to WKA. And before WKA sells goods to the \"gray market dealer\", it has explained clearly that if Nokia catches it, the penalty loss will be fully borne by the gray market dealer, and the real penalty will still be borne by the small dealer. A dealer told the press yesterday that now they make a few yuan in profit per phone, and some even make only 2 yuan, and the risk of suffering huge fines is too great. Many dealers have already resold the company\\'s brand. Those involved said yesterday that there would be more protests against Nokia in various places.']\n"

      "['石新', '正向', 'Beijing New Materials solemnly launched the Long Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board at the beginning of the new year. In order to meet the characteristics of the humid environment in the South China region, Beijing New Materials solemnly launched the Long Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board, which can prevent cracking and sinking. The gypsum board adopts a specially developed formula, which perfectly improves the board\\'s resistance to deformation and sagging. South China is located in the southernmost part of China, in the southeast coastal area of the Asian continent, with high temperature and abundant rainfall as its climate characteristics. Especially with the arrival of the rainy season, the air humidity is often above 85%. After a long time in a humid environment, ordinary gypsum products generally lose strength after absorbing moisture and getting damp, and are prone to warping deformation. The new Long Brand dual-proof gypsum board launched by Beixin Building Materials has made up for the shortcomings of the previous gypsum board, and demonstrated multiple advantages with its quality. First, the biggest feature of the Dragon Card double protection gypsum board is effective crack prevention. The dry-wet deformation rate of general fiber cement products is about 3%, while the new product, Long Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board, launched by Beixin Jiancail, has an expansion rate of less than 0.01%, which is more stable under the same conditions. This new product is also equipped with Long Brand Special Jointing Paste and Long Brand Special Jointing Paper Tape to form the Long Brand Anti-Crack System, providing full protection from the board to the system. Under standardized construction applications, cracking can be avoided. The second advantage of the Dragon Tile Double Protection Gypsum Board is to prevent subsidence. It is a company specifically for the characteristics of the humid environment in the south China region, and adopts a specially developed formula to change the crystalline state of the gypsum board from the original long needle-like crystals to block-like crystals, endowing the board with good mechanical strength, significantly improving the overall strength, effectively improving the board\\'s resistance to deformation and sagging. Become the best product tailored professionally and exclusively for your region. Third, the new product has better fire protection performance. The Dragon Tile Gypsum Board contains 20% crystalline water and a certain amount of free water. When it encounters fire, the free water evaporates first, which manifests as the release of water vapor and the absorption of a large amount of heat, inhibiting the increase in the surface temperature of the board. As the flame temperature continues to rise, the crystalline water between the molecules dehydrates, delaying the temperature rise, while reinforcing the fibers to act as a strengthening skeleton, maintaining the structural integrity. After professional testing, the burning performance of Long牌gypsum board has reached level A2. North New Materials has a complete fire protection application system, which can meet the fireproof wall structure requirements of 0.5-4 hours. In addition, the product is an environmentally friendly product. Beijing New Materials has passed the ISO14001 environmental management system certification and the national environmental mark product certification. The Dragon Brand Double Protection Gypsum Board does not contain harmful substances such as asbestos, and the new gypsum board has been favored by a wide range of customers since its launch. Technological innovation is the source of power for the continuous development of enterprises. As the pioneer of the gypsum board industry in China and the leader of the new building materials industry, Binhai New Materials has always been driving the enterprise to move forward and achieve leapfrog development through technological innovation. Every year, the company spends a lot of money to reward employees who have made outstanding contributions to technological innovation. By the end of 2009, Beixin Building Materials had applied for 701 patents, of which 560 were authorized, and its independent intellectual property patents and patent holdings have been among the top in the national building materials industry for many years. In the future, the company will continue to \"customer-centric, create customer value\" and provide more new products and satisfactory services to consumers. (Shi Xin)']\n"

At the end of the first quarter, Huaxia Dividend Selection did not enter the top ten circulating shareholders of the stock, and Huaxia Dividend Selection did not hold the stock at the beginning of this year and at the end of last year. Clearly, Wang Yawei made a large-scale intervention in Xinjiang Casting in the second quarter. And Chongqing Foundry has surged by 61.93% since July, while Hua Xia Selected has made substantial profits in a short period of time. International sugar prices have recently performed impressively, continuously creating new highs in rebound. Wang Yawei had a prescient insight and intervened in the sugar industry listed company Guizhou Sugar early in the second quarter. The semi-annual report of Guitan Corporation shows that among the top ten circulating shareholders at the end of the second quarter, four are public funds, all of which are Huaxia series funds. Among them, Huaxia Select and Huaxia Strategy are the fourth largest circulating shareholders with 3 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively.

While Gu Tang's top ten circulating shareholders in the first quarter report only had one fund shareholder, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's selected fund, which shows that the four funds of the Huaxia series collectively intervened in Gu Tang's shares in the second quarter. Boosted by the sharp rise in sugar prices, Guishang Sugar, which performed poorly in the second quarter, has risen by 32.8% since July. The second quarter report of the fund shows that China Resources Selected in the second quarter made a large-scale increase in holdings of China Petrochemical and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical, two petrochemical stocks, and another obscure petrochemical stock Daqing Huake was also visited by China Resources Selected. Daqing Huakuo's semi-annual report shows that at the end of the second quarter, Wang Yawei's two funds, Huaxia Selected and Huaxia Strategy, held 1.93 million and 1.2 million shares of Daqing Huakuo respectively, entering its top ten circulating shareholders for the first time, and they are the only fund shareholders among its top ten circulating shareholders. In addition to Daqing Huakuo, Huaxia Selection and Huaxia Strategy, two brother funds, also appeared in the top ten circulating shareholders of Lijiang Tourism, with Huaxia Dividend Payout holding nearly 2 million shares, ranking as the second largest circulating shareholder, and Huaxia Strategy holding 600,000 shares, ranking as the fifth largest circulating shareholder. The Changsheng Tongqing, which bought 1.19 million shares and ranked as the third largest circulating shareholder, was established with a fund of one billion yuan on May 12. And Huabao Industry Select, which entered the top ten circulating shareholders of Lijiang tourism at the end of the first quarter, reduced its holdings in the second quarter and disappeared from the top ten shareholders. In the second quarter, the Huaxia series funds made a large purchase or increase in Yudafang, and seven Huaxia series funds, including Huaxia Dashan Selection and Huaxia Strategy, entered the top ten circulating shareholders of Yudafang at the end of the second quarter, among which Huaxia Dashan Selection and Huaxia Strategy held 4.02 million shares and 1.99 million shares respectively, ranking as the third and eighth largest circulating shareholders. Although YuFazhan saw a 53.01% increase in the second quarter, its performance has been poor since July, with only a 6.41% increase.

Li Ting, reporter, Sports World: When you talk about your children, do you miss them very much every time you are away for a competition? O\\'Sullivan: Of course, they are my heart and soul, I miss them very much as soon as I leave home, but they are still too young, the daughter is three years old, the son is only one and a half years old, they may not understand my feelings very well. Sports: Why not bring the children too? O\\'Sullivan: I actually applied to the organizing committee, but the organizing committee did not agree. I thought to myself that I was here to compete, so it would be better to be more at ease. Sports: At 16, your father went to prison, which deprived you of a lot of paternal love. Will this make you want to give your child more paternal love? O\\'Sullivan: The growth of children needs a lot of care and help from parents, so as long as I have time, I will stay at home with them. Don\\'t think I am very busy, in fact, I only practice for two or three hours of the ball every day, and then leave more time for the family. But they are still too young to play together, and I can only play football with my son. Sports: I heard that your father was briefly released from prison recently. Can you talk about him? O\\'Sullivan: He is a very positive person, no matter what situation he faces, he will not be depressed, I think this is the biggest influence on me. He has always been concerned about and supported me, even if we cannot meet, he will understand my competition situation, and we will not be estranged due to distance. In the past, we could only communicate by phone or meet once every few months, and I believe that in the near future, we will be able to reunite again. Sports: I heard that you love running, which is also influenced by your father? O\\'Sullivan: My father would run every day when I was young, and I followed him. Later, I run 10 kilometers every day by myself. Now I basically run six days a week, which can relax my mind and body, maintain a good mental state, and keep fit. Now that I am old, I will gain fat on my belly, not muscle. (laugh) Do you want me to show you my abs? Sports field: six days a week, don\\'t you fear the wind, the sun, the rain and the dew? O\\'Sullivan: I\\'m a bit afraid of the rain and wind, but the sun is my favorite. Look at my skin, how is it? It\\'s very smooth, isn\\'t it? Tell you, I use the \"Sunshine brand\" moisturizing cream, recommend it to you. We still need to get more sun exposure. We don\\'t see the sun when we play snooker every day, but running allows me to bask in the sun, of course, I have to enjoy it. Sports field: How is your 100 meters? How far was the farthest one? O\\'Sullivan: My 100 meters is 9.6 seconds, very fast, (laugh) I\\'m joking, my 100 meters is about 14 seconds, a little embarrassed. The farthest I have run is 25 kilometers, which should be the distance of a half marathon, and it took me one and a half hours. My fastest record for 10 kilometers is 34 minutes. Sports: I see you are very concerned about your figure and appearance. I know you are a perfectionist. O\\'Sullivan: Yes, perfect form, that\\'s what I always aim for, and I always remind myself to do so, I know it\\'s very difficult, so I will make a great effort to face it. Sports: How to understand perfection? What is perfection in snooker? O\\'Sullivan: Perfect is that you can never reach the perfect realm, but you can maintain a high level of continuity. This applies to all aspects. No matter how high you consistently achieve in any aspect, you are the dominant person in that aspect. The perfect score in snooker is 147 points. Of course, you can\\'t get 147 points in every match, as I said just now, perfection itself does not exist, but it is a process of continuous pursuit. I am not a perfect person either, but I will demand this standard of myself. In the sports world, so you often give up the rest of the game after playing poorly at the beginning? O\\'Sullivan: I do want to play every match perfectly, if the start is not good, I will feel that even if I play well later, winning the game, the process is not what I want, this will make me lose interest in the game, but not often, just occasionally. Sports: I remember that this \"occasional\" happened in your match with Hendry in the British Championship in 2006. O\\'Sullivan: Oh, you remember it very clearly. At that time, I was 1-4 behind, and I felt there was no hope. It was better to end it early rather than continue, anyway, the result could be foreseen. I gave up and left after finishing that game. I also paid a price for it, was fined and deducted points, which can be considered a lesson, and now I should not do it anymore. Sports: You know, for the development of snooker, the IPT has made many reforms, but the results were not very good. O\\'Sullivan: I know that snooker\\'s commercial development is not going well, but the specifics, I don\\'t understand. This has nothing to do with me. I am not Sir Walker. I only care about playing my own game well. If I were Sir Walks? Oh, no, it\\'s impossible, I\\'m just Ronnie O\\'Sullivan, just doing what Ronnie O\\'Sullivan should do. Sports: Can you give some advice for the development of snooker? O\\'Sullivan: Then you pay me for consulting fees? (Smiling) Anyway, considering the gift you gave me, I can waive your consultation fee. Actually, my fee is quite high. To be honest, the development of this sport is not in my control. In the sports world, Sir Walker once said that he would consider moving the World Championship to China. Would you be willing to participate in such a major competition outside of the UK? O\\'Sullivan: It\\'s the same everywhere, it\\'s just a matter of whether you can adapt to the mood. Even if that were the case, I would definitely adapt, don\\'t forget, Ronnie is perfectionist, as you said. Sports: What do you think you have brought to snooker? O\\'Sullivan: Speed? Passion? 147? I like it when people talk about the players while watching snooker and say, \"Oh, that\\'s O\\'Sullivan, my favorite player, he can get 147.\" I am at the top of this sport, which can attract attention and attract people to pay attention to snooker. Sports: How can young people achieve the achievements of O\\'Sullivan? O\\'Sullivan: They should learn a lot from the masters. I suggest that they watch more videos of players like Hendry and Davis, practice more, and focus. I became the current O\\'Sullivan by learning from other masters in the process, I used to often record Hendry\\'s matches and watch and learn repeatedly. Sports: There are now many children in China who learn snooker, and they all drop out of school to devote themselves to this sport. O\\'Sullivan: Like this? I think education is very important. Of course, if a child is really not interested in anything else and only likes snooker, he can continue to practice as long as he wishes. But in addition, it is necessary to come into contact with other knowledge, which is a balance that must be handled well. Sports: Talk about the current economic crisis, what do you feel in the UK? O\\'Sullivan: Yes, the whole world is now experiencing a crisis, and the UK should be more serious than China. In fact, I don\\'t think we need to be too worried, thinking about how the economic crisis will be, this is also the natural law of the development of the world, just like people will also get sick. The key is that even if the economic crisis takes away some of our money, it cannot take away our spirit. As long as we have faith, everything will pass. Sports: You have some business in London as well. Has the economic crisis had an impact? O\\'Sullivan: I do some property and shops, but I don\\'t pay much attention to it. There is certainly an impact, but it\\'s not huge. My only \"business\" is snooker, and I only care about other industries when there is no competition. Sports field: Do you think you are more popular in China or in the UK? O\\'Sullivan: Britain, after all, snooker has a long history in Britain, many people like snooker and understand snooker, but in China, although there are also many fans asking me for autographs and photos, but I don\\'t know how they think of snooker, because I can\\'t communicate with them. Sports field: Have you been to Beijing and Shanghai, and have you been to other Chinese cities? Which one do you like best? O\\'Sullivan: Each city in China gives a different feeling. Shanghai is very fashionable, now it is an international metropolis, I like the buildings there, very diversified. Nanjing has a very nice environment. And Beijing is a fascinating place with too many surprises, I want to bring my children to see it in summer. Sports field: Is there a special place you want to go every time you come to Beijing? O\\'Sullivan: Restaurant, that\\'s one I have to go to. Do you like Chinese food? Oh no, I don\\'t like it, I love it, I love it so much! Every time I come to Beijing, I go to some Cantonese restaurants near the hotel to eat seafood, and I also cook seafood for my children at home. But speaking of my favorite, it\\'s the dim sum in Guangzhou. Every time I go to Guangzhou, I will eat a lot of dim sum, which is too exquisite. At this point, it was lunchtime, and O\\'Sullivan said after drinking coffee, \"Last night I went to a Cantonese restaurant nearby, and the steamed fish was very delicious, and I will have another one later.\" O\\'Sullivan smiled as he prepared to return to his room, and took two steps before turning back. \"Oh, my lucky calf, I forgot to take it. I wonder if it will help me win the championship?\" \"']\n"

In the summer vacation of 2007, Dirk Nowitzki, from Frankfurt, via Dubai, to Australia, 62-year-old mentor Holger Geschwindner was his only travel companion. The Great Barrier Reef, Melbourne, Adelaide, they rented a car and ran almost the whole of Australia in five weeks. When Dirk returned to Germany again, he was a wild man with a full beard. It was a journey of the soul, as Dirk put it, to seek the \"essence of life.\" He needs to forget the inevitable connection between his MVP individual glory and the Mavericks\\' eighth-game elimination humiliation. What was most difficult for me was that this MVP would always be associated with the Mavericks\\' first-round elimination, and people would say that Nowitzki\\'s award was a case of name and reality not matching. When I think back to last season, I don\\'t think of the MVP, but the playoff failure, and losing is something I can never get over. It is not only him who can never let go, but it is also this trip that taught him how to let go. For, letting go enables us to reach a farther distance. Before 2007, he had played for the league for 9 years, and he was one of the five best players in the league, the new MVP, leading the Mavericks to a record of 67 wins and 15 losses. So what does it matter? All the glory collapsed in the face of the eighth black, leaving a desolate scene. Or, in fact, the wheel of fate was already set in motion in the 2006 Finals, when they were thoroughly defeated and missed those damned free throws. In the jungle of the southern hemisphere, Nowitzki thought, \"Where am I?\" Where are we going? Is one person\\'s effort destined to be powerless against a powerful fate? Years later, four years from now, he will stand on the stage of the final again, finally able to breathe more calmly, and carefully recall the past and present of these 12 years in Dallas. In 1998, Nelson brought him from Milwaukee to Dallas. Those who know him well will remember the photo, with him, thin and thin, holding up the white Dallas jersey, with Steve Nash, also thin and thin, combing the same funny hairstyle. At just twenty years old, his inexperience was not limited to his ball skills; he faced the unfamiliar world helplessly and hesitantly, yet with vigilance. In the 1999-2000 season, he started in 81 games and played all 82 games. With enough trust from the old Neilson, he returned with a doubled average score. Since the 2000-01 season, the Mavericks have been making consecutive playoff appearances, and Dirk and Nash\\'s selection to the All-Star team also heralded the imminent rise of Dallas. The dream began to show cracks in 2004, after Nash left the arena following the first round of the playoffs and never returned. Destiny, when Dirk encountered Nash\\'s Suns in the Western Conference Semifinals in May 2005, he began to believe in the existence of the word for the first time. Yao Ming volunteered to play against Francis, his opponent, for the first time on the court, saying that he could only put down his heart after defeating him. Dec also, his fate forced him to a dead end, all he needed to do was break it! Unfortunately, that year, he watched Nash and his Phoenix Suns march into the Western Conference Finals, while the Mavericks went home again. The time has come to the early summer of 2006, Nash and Finley\\'s departure is no longer a wound in the heart, the healed scar becomes the reason to hold on, even if we are far apart, we still need to win something for each other. They swept the Grizzlies 4-0, defeated the Spurs in seven games in the Western Conference Finals, and met Nash again in the Western Conference Finals. The first four games were tied 2-2, with each team losing one home game. Back in Dallas, Dirk scored 50 points, shooting 53.8% from the field, 94.4% from the free-throw line, and 83.3% from beyond the arc. The Mavericks scored 35-20 in the fourth quarter and took the lead. 4-2, Dirk and Nash bid farewell to each other, and also bid farewell to the fate that shackled him for the whole year, stepping onto a new stage. That year, he was 28, the most golden age of his life. That year, he had Jason Terry by his side. Two consecutive victories, and the beautiful scenery was just ahead, but the damned destiny once again disrupted the third game. The first three quarters went as the Mavericks had planned, with the Mavericks leading by 9 points, 77-68. However, in the final quarter, Wade led the Heat to a comeback. With 9.3 seconds left in the game, Peay made a three-pointer to give the Heat the lead. DeKok scored by drawing a foul, but, ironically, his best shot was his downfall. Two free throws, Wade grabs the rebound, the Mavericks have to foul, and hand over the victory. Like in 2005 when they lost to the Suns, Dirk under-estimated the power of a mental collapse, losing four straight and allowing the opponent to hoist the trophy in his own arena. In 2007, with 67 wins and 15 losses, the best record in the league, and the regular season MVP, Nowitzki still did not expect that his opponent would be the coach who could not be broken - his former coach, Neilson. The Golden State Warriors became a real champion under the coaching of Neil, and they sent the leader Mavericks back home with a 4-2 in the first round. If the failure in the finals was somewhat comforting, the eighth seed completely pushed Nowitzki into the abyss, from which there was no return. He could not understand, and he did not understand, what had led him to this situation. Why did all of it turn into shame, even though one had done one\\'s best and it was the supreme honor? Weak, fake leaders, and eternal tragic side characters, these labels are无情地贴上, and it is hard to remove them. Back then, Terry did not understand him either, even though everyone around them had long dispersed to the ends of the earth. Was was it right or wrong to send Devin-Harris and welcome Kidd? History is never written in a day, and the success or failure of a transaction also needs time to be verified. At least through the 2007-2008 season, the Mavericks were a disappointment, and Kidd was unable to bring them a miracle against the young star Chris Paul, who still lost in the first round. In the 08-09 season, Carles took over the coaching, and this coach, who is affectionately called \"Golden Karry\", is completely different from General Johnson. He is more refined and more unemotional. But beneath his calm exterior lies unwavering trust in Nowitzki. Beat the Spurs 4-1, lost to the Nuggets in the semifinals, by this time, the West was no longer the West of old. Compared with the Lakers, the Nuggets, or the new Hornets, the Mavericks are much more luxurious and much stronger. Another 55-27 record, and the regular season of the 09-10 season gave the Mavericks enough capital to be the top seed in the Southwest Division, but they still lost to the Spurs. Another blood debt, and this time, without knowing when it started, Nowitzki and the entire Mavericks had a touch of indifference. It is formed imperceptibly, a metamorphosis of temperament. From the time I put on the Mavericks\\' jersey to today, it has been 13 years, and it has been 7 years since I left Nash and started walking my own path. These years were soaked in tears, pushed down from the clouds again and again, and also the process in which Dirk swallowed the bitterness of fate mouth by mouth. I once doubted that I walked in the desert and never bore fruit no matter what dream spread its wings and the wind was silent. Can the habit of pain be considered a harvest? But you must believe that there is only sunshine and no shadow, only joy and no pain, and this is not the norm of life. Smooth seas do not make skilled sailors. Dreams may be forgotten, but Novak\\'s dream is engraved in his heart, how can he forget it. The first round of elimination of the Trail Blazers was still somewhat hesitant, and the sweep of the Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals more often than not made people see the depth of the entire Mavericks team. The Thunder, who caused the most trouble for the Mavericks, also gave Dirk the most opportunities to prove himself. A miracle of 24 successful free throws, key shots in consecutive two games, a decisive three-pointer for advancement... He began to shoulder the responsibility of a true leader, not scoring 50+ points every game, not dragging the team forward with his own efforts. He learned to pass more, he persisted in restraining himself, being cautious with his shots, and he fulfilled his teammates, in exchange for his teammates\\' fulfillment of him. Most importantly, at the moment of life and death, when his teammate trusts him to pass the ball to him, there is no hesitation, no hesitation in his eyes. It is a clear sky, where dreams can soar freely. So, fate once again brought the Heat to him at the right time. To clear his name, he has a real destiny to break. Five years ago, he drowned in the scorching flames, and five years later, he will be reborn from the flames! Fortunately, I never turned back and finally found that there really is an oasis. Every drop of sweat makes life heavier. Only after walking out of depression did I see the new universe, vast and boundless. After being brave, I will use perseverance to break the lock of fate. Thank you for being cold, for once looking down on me, making me not bow my head and live a more wonderful life. You have never been competing with anyone, not with a team, but your true enemy has always been yourself. In June 2011, this driver from Germany, driving the dream of Dallas, finally had the opportunity to fight against fate one more time. The Heat is no longer the Heat of the past, the Mavericks are no longer the Mavericks of the past, and Nowitzki is no longer the Dirk of the past. He has always felt guilty, and he will use his iron will to be tempered in the Heat\\'s furnace and become steel! (Warm)']\n"

      "['肖睿哲,肖睿,妈妈,爸爸,王学集,林耀纳,王定标,王坚,马云,肖睿智,德宗', '正向', 'From the hot spring enthusiast Xiao Ruize, you can see that small dreams can also germinate and grow robustly from the 26-year-old Xiao Ruize. This boy, born in the 80s, is a member of the recently hot \"Ali Cloud\", and is also the deputy general manager of phpwind (Hangzhou De Tian Information Technology Co., Ltd.). At work, he shows maturity beyond his age, but in life, he is still playful like a teenager and relies on his mother. His goal is to become a “heroic entrepreneur” who can turn things around, a soul of the enterprise. Xiao Ruize\\'s schedule is full every day, for example, today: in the morning, he handled some trivial matters in the hotel, had an interview at noon, held a meeting with all the colleagues in Beijing in the afternoon, and continued to develop the product at night. He didn\\'t have a moment\\'s rest all day. Before the interview, Xiao Ruize took a half hour to run in the gym, saying that sweating could make him energetic. After all, this 26-year-old big boy is full of energy. Xiao Ruize was born in a business family in Wuhan, where his father was engaged in business early on, so the family was well-off. But his business situation plunged to the bottom because of a failed real estate investment. Xiao Ruize saw the capriciousness of fate in him, and also planted the resolve to turn his fate around in adversity. From phpwind to cloud computing, perhaps originating from his father\\'s business genes, Xiao Ruize has always had the dream of entrepreneurship. He had already created his own game website with classmates in high school and even earned some income. But in high school, starting a business was just a spur-of-the-moment decision, wanting to make the website bigger, but not knowing how to make the website develop steadily. But that experience and experience sowed the seeds for Xiao Ruize\\'s later career. After Xio Ruozhe was admitted to Beijing Jiaotong University with good grades, he delayed his studies due to his second entrepreneurial venture, which led to his failure to graduate smoothly. During this entrepreneurial process, Xiao Rui learned practical operating experience. Before graduation, in order to prove his ability, he participated in the selection for the graduation thesis and won the first place in the evaluation. After graduation, Xiao Ruize once worked in an advertising company and a game company. At that time, his classmates, Wang Xueji and Lin Yaona, had already started to prepare to create phpwind. In 2006, under Wang Xueji\\'s invitation, Xiao Ruizhe finally found \"his own home\" and started to work hard again with his classmates. When I first joined PHPWind, it was a small company with only 20 people, half of whom were classmates and the other half were online friends. The company was located in a university district, renting a 3000 yuan per month office, and the office furniture and computers were chosen to be the most cost-effective. During this period, Xiao Ruize had already felt the responsibility he had to shoulder, and could no longer ignore the existence of the team for the sake of his personal dreams. Managers are responsible for the future of all employees. He began to learn the business model of people from Jiang-Zhe, \"Jiang-Zhe people manage costs very strictly, and the money spent today will definitely become the output of tomorrow.\" That\\'s why PHPWind did not die young because of the efforts to minimize costs. The first risk investment came from Wang Dingbiao’s 3 million yuan, which boosted the confidence of several young entrepreneurs. With money, but the few people still try to compress costs, the company moved to a cheaper incubator; before going to Beijing twice a year, they accumulated a pile of work to be done on business trips, used the discount cards of the hotel, and maximized the value of the business trip expenses. There is another thing that still makes Xiao Ruize talk about it with great interest. It was the Spring Festival during the start-up period, and they only had 20,000 yuan in cash to give as bonuses to their employees. With a thin stack of money in hand, how to distribute it among 30 employees?  Xiao Ruizhe wished he could write a program. To his delight, his colleagues did not quarrel over the amount of the bonus at the Spring Festival party, but drank to their heart\\'s content for the company\\'s development, which made this Spring Festival unforgettable for him. During the growth of phpwind, Xiao Ruize learned how to manage a team and how to cope with competition. Although the company has grown to 200 people, apart from the Hangzhou headquarters, a Beijing branch was opened this year, but most of the colleagues from the start-up period have not been lost. Xiao Ruizhe said, \"At that time, the management team was all about emotions, but now we need to rely on incentive systems and standardized management models, and we can\\'t manage in a sentimental way as before.\" And the product also brought pressure on R&D after it was widely used. In order to upgrade the product, Xiao Ruizhe and his colleagues lived in the company for three days and three nights, and finally developed a bacterial infection because they did not take off their shoes. Fortunately, the efforts have finally paid off. After half a year of investigation of phpwind by Alibaba, from their research and development technology to the mentality of the personnel, after several rounds of negotiations, phpwind was finally incorporated into the Alibaba Cloud Computing Center. Though it has joined Alibaba Cloud, phpwind still operates its own business independently, and this two-pronged approach has given them more opportunities and allowed them to ride on the coattails of IT \"big shots\". At Alibaba Cloud, Xiao Ruizhe met his idol, Wang Jian, the former dean of Zhejiang University with three doctorates, who was already a top figure in the technical field in his forties, and also had a sensitive side, a soul figure who shone in the enterprise. To be the soul of a company and a hero who turns the tide in adversity has always been Xiao Ruizhé’s dream. For this, he let himself be thoroughly tempered in his twenties. Perhaps Xiao Ruizhé at the age of 30 will become the next Ma Yun. For Xiao Ruizhé, time is always not enough, from start-ups to medium-sized enterprises. But unlike his predecessors, this IT manager in his 80s is more concerned with the feelings of “people”. An important part of the Phpwind team building is “OUTTING”, which is a place with mountains and clear water selected by the company for meetings or training. Xiao Ruize believes that play and work can be unified, although he doesn\\'t have much energy to enjoy the mountains and rivers each time. He will laugh heartily when he sees his colleagues completely relax after brainstorming. Before he became a hot spring enthusiast, Xiao Ruize was a collector of electronic products, which was related to his work as an IT professional. As soon as new electronic products were released, he would buy them immediately and often disassembled and modified them himself. From big computer hosts to small mobile phones and digital cameras, there is a small mountain of electronic collections in my home in Hangzhou. In recent years, with the development of his career and the maturity of his personality, Xiao Ruize has become less enthusiastic about electronic products. Now, he is a hot spring collector, and he has his own hot spring ranking in his heart. His first hot spring experience was in Jiu Hua Villa in Xiaotangshan, Beijing, where he was studying, and he was thoroughly disappointed. The water in the hot spring pool is suspicious, and there are too many people. The scenery is also not beautiful. Taking a hot spring bath again was several years later when PHPWind was done in Hangzhou. Xiao Ruize went to the hot springs in Wuyi, Jinhua, near Hangzhou. There is a Clear Water Bay Hot Spring Resort there, which has hot spring pools of various styles and cute fish therapy facilities. Wuyi trip made Xiao RuiZhi fall in love with hot springs. Perhaps because people are most relaxed when naked and in water, taking a bath or soaking in a hot spring clears my mind and quickly relieves my stress. Xiao Ruize is very fond of the Drunken Hot Spring in Huangshan. When he bathes in the hot spring in the mountains, there are lush forests around him. In the evening, he drinks and bathes in the hot spring, and chats with friends, which is even more pleasant. Beihai is where Xiao Ruizhé often goes. He likes the quiet and secluded of Weizhou Island, and he likes the natural and simple style of the hot springs there. In order to enjoy hot springs, Xiao Ruizhe also went to Hokkaido, Japan, \"It is a naked hot spring, the scenery is very impressive, it was snowing outside, and we were drinking wine in the warm hot spring, it was too enjoyable.\" It was just that Xiao Ruize felt that although the Japanese hot springs were good, they lacked a sense of ease and contentment because he was away from home. The first place in Xiao Ruizhe’s heart is the Dayue Valley Hot Spring in Xiamen, where not only is the scenery beautiful and the food delicious, but the hot spring water is also genuine mineral water. So far, Xiao Ruize has visited nearly 10 hot springs, and he plans to experience the hot springs in Europe in the future, \"I heard that the ancient Europeans used hot springs to treat and maintain health.\" Compared with many 80s who rely on their parents, Xiao Ruizhé, who became a vice president, is a rare filial child. In order to cheer up his father who was disappointed in the mall, Xiao Ruizhé moved his parents to Hangzhou. It is not that he is afraid that they will not be concerned about him, but that he is not concerned about them. Every morning, Xiao Ruize eats breakfast made by his mother before going to work, has a lunchbox made by his mother with love for lunch, and after work at 11 p.m., his mother has already prepared sweet soup for him to wait for him. The whole family gathers to drink soup and chat together.  Xiao Ruizhe also got a supplementary card for his mother, letting her buy whatever she liked, and letting his father do whatever he liked, which was his way of expressing love. I have the ability to take on the responsibility of taking care of the family now, and my wish is to see my parents happy and not worry about them anymore. In fact, while he was giving love, he also felt the power of love. Every time I stay in a hotel on a business trip, I have to wash and iron my own clothes, and then I realize how good it is to have my mother around. When encountering difficulties at work, thinking about the look of Mom and Dad at home waiting for me, I will be full of the courage to work hard. This 26-year-old big boy has learned to take care of a company, take care of his family and colleagues, watch his young dreams sprout and grow strong, and be grateful that his youth was not wasted. Xiao Ruize\\'s hot spring guide, Wuyi hot spring is located in Jinhua, Zhejiang. In addition to traditional hot springs, there are also yogurt pools, coffee pools, reishi pools, osmanthus pools, famous tree pools, famous flower pools, aloe pools, wine pools, Wu Yang Chun Yu pools (tea hot springs), West Lake pools (the shape is like West Lake, and there are also three moons in the water), fish therapy pools, etc. The Huangshan Drunken Hot Spring is located in the Huangshan scenic area in Anhui Province, and is divided into 7 major themes, namely, the hydrotherapy area, the dynamic area, the beauty area, the food and beverage area, the hot spring square area, the micro essence area, and the wooden house area, with a total of more than 50 series and 60 hot spring pools. Drunk Hot Spring belongs to a multi-complex thermal spring with orthosilicic acid, rich in orthosilicic acid, potassium, sodium, magnesium, bromine, iron and other trace elements, with a neutral and mild water quality, pH value of 6.6. Weizhou Hot Spring Weizhou Island is the largest and youngest extinct volcano island in China, located 36 nautical miles southeast of Beihai City, Guangxi, facing the Silver Beach across the sea. There is a Sunset Island nearby, and standing on Weizhou Island, you can see the sun shining obliquely on the island, which is known as the famous \"Weizhou Sunset\". The hot springs on the island are natural and simple. Tourists can enjoy seafood while soaking in the hot springs, which is a rare combination of delicious food and hot springs. The Beihai hot spring is located in Tengchong, Yunnan. It was originally a simple open-air bathing pond, with hot water supplied by a single well, with a water temperature of 55℃ and a daily water output of 1100 cubic meters. After the geological departments have examined and tested it, the water quality is low mineralization carbonic hot spring water, which contains a small amount of beneficial trace elements and radioactive elements for the human body. In addition to being used for bathing and treating diseases, it can also be made into high-quality drinking mineral water, which is one of the few hot springs in Tengchong that can be bathed and drunk. The Xiamen Ruyegu Hot Spring Master Plan covers 260,000 square meters, with a magnificent and rich Southeast Asian exotic style, and has nearly a hundred open-air hot spring soaking pools and dozens of characteristic hot springs. The hot spring water of the Sun Moon Valley comes from 200 meters underground, and the outlet water temperature is 82℃. The eggs cooked with pure hot spring water fully absorb the minerals in the hot spring water, replenish various nutrients needed by the human body every day, and have good health care and health care effects. The hot springs by the Nujiang River in Lushui County, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, are the most famous folk customs, which are held during the Spring Festival, called \"Bath Pond Meeting\". People go down to the hot and simple stone hot spring bath pool, wash away the dirt, stretch their muscles and bones, and then gather together to talk and sing, actually it is also the festival of the Lisu people. Dezong Hot Spring is 140 kilometers away from Lhasa, located in a valley, with high mountain pastures on both sides of the mountain, and green grass like a carpet. The hot springs are bubble baths that can treat many skin diseases. The pools are divided into male and female pools, separated by a stone wall. Interestingly, the dogs at Deyong Hot Springs laze around basking in the sun, watching those naked people. Meiqi/Wen Fan Everlasting/Photography']\n"

Sina Sports News, June 4, 2016 - Four days after winning his first qualification for the US Open, the Swede Alexander Noren (Alexander Noren) won the second round of the Welsh Open at the Celtic Manor with a one-stroke lead. The defending champion with the fifth ranking in the world, Graeme McDowell, is in second place, while the American star John Daly, the Ryder Cup star Simonis, and Ross Fisher were eliminated in their first appearance. Noren, ranked 127th in the world, shot a second consecutive 67 (-4) in the second round of the Wales Open, and led with a total score of 134 (-8). McIlroy, the Northern Ireland ace, carded a 68 (-3) and was second with a total score of 135 (-7). Jamie Donaldson, a Welsh native (68), and Victor Dubuisson of France (69) are tied for third place with a total score of 136 (-6). The first round leaders, Keith Horne (73), who is one of the players on the European Ryder Cup team last year, Peter Hanson (72), and the English veteran Barry Lane (69), are all tied for fifth place with a total score of 137 (-5). Among them, Barry Lane, who will turn 51 at the end of this month, is expected to become the oldest winner of the European Tour here. Norren successfully made it through the U.S. Open European Qualifier at Walton Heath Golf Club in Walden, England, this Monday, and for the first time, he has qualified for a major in the U.S. This certainly gave him the confidence to arrive at the Celtic Manor. I have always dreamed of participating in the US Open, and I am very happy, very happy, which greatly enhances vitality. This 28-year-old Swede had only played in two Open Championships before, and he tied for 19th at the 2008 Open Championship. In the second round of the Wales Open, Noren performed very well in the last stage, and captured 4 eagles in the last 5 holes, thus rising to the top by one stroke. Since he left for the competition early in the morning, he finished the competition early, and at that time, he mistakenly estimated the total number of strokes of the leader in the second round to be -9 or -10. After all, it was Noren himself who ended up leading after 36 holes with a score of -8. The course felt long to play, as if you needed to use a lot of fairway woods to hit the ball, but today you had to use a 7-iron, 6-iron, and 5-iron. You can play quite safely, but you will face a long putter distance and a difficult putter if you want to get a birdie, which will be very difficult. Noren only won one tournament on the European Tour, which was the Omega European Masters in 2009. McDoel also had four birdies in five holes, starting from the 8th hole. However, his highlight of the round was a brilliant recovery from the edge of the sand trap on the shorter 10th hole. One of the boys said that Sever (Seve Ballesteros) would be proud of that shot. McDoar said, \"I am standing on a course I like, in a position I enjoy.\" This is definitely the perfect moment to gear up for the US Open (he will defend his US Open title two weeks later). I said that I just wanted to enter the championship, inspire, and now I have a sense of completing the task. McDoel will strive to become the first champion to successfully defend his title in the 12-year history of the Welsh Open. Donohue, meanwhile, has risen to become the highest-ranked Welsh player in the world, and he is still chasing his first European Tour title of his career. I played very well, maybe even better than yesterday, but I played quite well yesterday. The game today was tough because of the wind, so it was important to keep your score and hold multiple holes at par. Following a hole-in-one by Elliot Saltman, a Scottish player, on the 17th hole, which measures 211 yards, on Thursday, another Scottish player, George Murray, also made a hole-in-one on the 17th hole on Friday. Unfortunately, it takes a hole-in-one at the 13th hole, 189 yards in length, to win the car prize provided by the sponsor. After two rounds of the Welsh Open, the cut-off score for the final qualification was set at 144 strokes (+2), with a total of 65 players qualifying for the final. The 26th ranked Spanish star, Simonis, who was a member of the European team in the 2017 Ryder Cup (73-72), one of the vice-captains of the European team in the 2017 Ryder Cup, Thomas Bjørn (69-76), Indian star Vijay Singh (68-79), Oliver Wilson, a member of the European team in the 2008 Ryder Cup (73-77), three-time Asian Tour money king Thongchai Jaidee (76-75), Ross Fisher, a member of the European team in the 2017 Ryder Cup (70-79), John Daly, a two-time major champion making his debut in the Welsh Open (77-75), and Montgomerie, the eight-time European Tour money king and the winning captain of the European team in the 2010 Ryder Cup (78-79), and other stars were eliminated. Fischer, who is ranked 52nd in the world, is likely to remain outside the top 50 after his elimination, which means he is likely to miss the U.S. Open in two weeks. Browse Scores>>(Luo Yi)']\n"

In the past 20 trading days, the average daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was over 1.5 billion shares, but only 800 million shares were traded today. There was no important economic data released today, nor any important company news, and the stock market was running according to its own rules. Due to the US stock and bond markets being closed next Monday for Memorial Day in the US, many investors have already left the market to enjoy the long weekend.

With the AAA credit rating of the UK, which is under threat of downgrade in the shadow of the lingering economic crisis, the impact may be long-term and far-reaching, according to Jim Reid, a credit strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a text message to clients. In the last nine trading days, the S&P 500 has fallen for seven days in a row. “Optimists’ view is being tested at the crucial moment,” Lena Komileva, of G7’s Market Economics Department, wrote in a text message to clients. Recent economic data have reinforced the view that the global economic downturn following the Lehman period is over, and that the slowing rate of global economic decline appears to be a normal early sign of recovery, but it does not fit the normal economic cycle. On Friday, the Bank of Japan announced that there were signs of improvement in the Japanese economy. This is the BoJ's first such statement in three years.

      "['张先生,王某,王师傅,曹卢杰', '正向', 'The car owner spent one hour every day to draw out the diesel and take it home to prevent it from being stolen. Last night around 10 p.m., a citizen reported to the police that a couple was stealing diesel from the diesel tank of an engineering vehicle on the roadside of Chunjiang Street in Nanjing with a homemade oil pump. The police arrived at the scene quickly and found it was a misunderstanding. The man and woman were the owners of the engineering truck. Recently, it was difficult to add diesel, and the thief often visited to steal the oil from their truck. They are really afraid of being stolen, and they have no choice but to come up with a clumsy anti-theft method, drawing the diesel in the fuel tank every day, carrying it home for the night, and pouring it back into the fuel tank in the morning. Though it was troublesome, I felt relieved when I went to bed after coming back home every day. It was a false alarm. Someone stole the diesel from the construction vehicle. Nanjing Chunjiang Street has wide roads, and the slow lanes on both sides of the road have become free parking lots. There are a large number of trucks, cranes, and construction vehicles parked here every evening. At 10 pm the previous night, Mr. Zhang drove to Chunjiang Street to look for a parking space, and found a man holding a homemade oil pump, drawing diesel from the fuel tank of an engineering vehicle, and all the diesel drawn flowed into a flat iron oil drum. There was a woman by the man\\'s side, constantly looking around, and sometimes urging the man to speed up with the oil. Soon, the diesel in the engineering vehicle\\'s fuel tank was sucked dry. The couple sealed the diesel that was pumped out and quickly stuffed it into a van. There are few gas stations with diesel recently, and even if there are gas stations with diesel, vehicles are lined up in long queues and it takes a few hours to get fuel. That couple came out to smoke diesel oil in the middle of the night, and their actions were strange, as if they were stealing diesel oil. Mr. Zhang said that he did not think much and called 110 to report the crime. We were wrong to think that we were preventing the theft of diesel oil. The 110 police officers arrived to patrol Chunjiang Street. The man and woman did not try to avoid the police car when they saw it from a distance, but continued to draw diesel oil. This \"reckless\" scene also surprised the police. The police verified the identity information of the man and woman and the vehicle information, and the result was that it was a misunderstanding. This couple was not a thief, they were the owner of the engineering vehicle, and they drew the oil in the fuel tank to prevent thieves from stealing oil. Behind the scare was helplessness. According to Wang Mou, a man, he was working on a construction site in Nanjing, and in addition to two engineering vehicles, he also had a small crane. With diesel in short supply recently, he would have his workers fill up all three cars with fuel every day before he went home from work. In this way, we can start working on time after getting up in the morning, and will not delay the schedule. But five days ago, when Master Wang started his car after breakfast, he found that there was not much diesel left on the crane\\'s dashboard. How could the oil added the previous night be gone? Master Wang got off the car to check the fuel tank, which showed no damage, but the fuel tank was empty. Only then did he realize that he had been robbed. Master Wang was very annoyed and hurriedly checked the fuel tanks of the other two engineering vehicles, only to find that the fuel tanks of the engineering vehicles had also been emptied. Not only did we lose more than two thousand yuan in fuel costs, but the work for the day at the construction site was also ruined. Master Wang reported the police at that time. The police made a record and began an investigation upon arrival. Not long after the oil theft case in front of it had not yet been solved, the thief also paid attention to the oil tank of his own crane, and lost a box of diesel oil again, delaying one day\\'s construction period. The Wang couple came up with a desperate measure after being robbed so many times: they would empty the diesel in the fuel tank every day, take it home to keep, and pour it back into the fuel tank the next day, so that the thieves would be disappointed. Not wanting to be caught pumping oil this time, what was originally meant to prevent oil theft was misunderstood as an oil thief. An impromptu measure with hidden dangers, it takes a few hours to draw oil for three cars at a time. \"If it weren\\'t for the diesel being watched closely, I wouldn\\'t be willing to go through so much trouble to draw oil every day and store it at home.\" Master Wang said that he had to go to the construction site early every morning and could only finish work at 6 p.m. That the income of his family depended on these three vehicles, and that the engineering vehicle and the crane would be nothing but scrap metal if they ran out of fuel, and that the income of his family would be lost. Last time, three cars had their diesel stolen, losing over 2000 yuan in fuel costs, and all three cars broke down by the roadside. Then he begged his grandparents and finally borrowed some diesel fuel from a fellow worker after two hours. He managed to drive the three cars to a nearby gas station and filled them with fuel only by night, and the work on the construction site was delayed. He failed to accomplish anything in a day, didn\\'t earn any money, and was even verbally abused by the construction site boss, which made him extremely angry. To ensure that the construction site could start work normally, Master Wang, as soon as he finished work every day, would go to refuel. Each time he refueled, it would take at least three hours, and sometimes up to five hours. It was too heartbreaking to have the diesel fuel that he had worked hard to get stolen, so he made up his mind to draw the diesel fuel in the fuel tank and then drag it home, no matter how hard it was. Three cars\\' fuel tanks can hold 300 liters of diesel, and it will take at least an hour to empty them. Six 50-liter drums are needed to hold all the fuel. Master Wang said that drawing oil was a troublesome job. At the beginning, he used a leather hose to draw oil, but he had to suck it with his mouth. He would drink a mouthful of diesel and feel sick. Later, the oil was extracted with a homemade simple oil pump. The simple oil pump is similar to the tools used to buy soy sauce before, which relies on manual operation and is very laborious. This is not the worst part; after pumping oil into six barrels every day, I have to drive them home in a minivan, and then drive them back the next day to refill the fuel tank. Mr. Wang and his wife hope that the diesel shortage will end soon so that they can stop enduring this unnecessary hardship. Is it safe to store diesel in a residential building, with Master Wang working hard to extract diesel every day and then dragging it home to save? The journalist interviewed Nanjing Fire Department on this issue. Firefighters told the reporters that diesel is flammable but not explosive, and most of the diesel has a flash point above 60℃. Moreover, it is not listed in the Catalogue of Hazardous Chemicals, so it does not belong to hazardous chemicals. However, large-scale storage is definitely not allowed, and storing a small amount in iron containers does not constitute a violation of the law. But diesel is flammable, and it still has a certain degree of danger. If it catches fire, the consequences will be unimaginable. So, Master Wang should not take the diesel oil home for storage. The firefighters also told the reporters that, although diesel is a heavy oil, it sometimes contains light oil components, especially the diesel produced by some small oil refineries or individual oil refining points, which do not meet the standard and often contain components of light oil. These substances are volatile and will burn when they encounter an open flame, causing an explosion when they reach the explosive limit. If there is such diesel stored at home, it is equivalent to bringing a \"time bomb\" home. Cao Lujie wrote and took the photos.']\n"

      "['杨章玉,金立,刘立荣', '正向', 'Clones are a stumbling block to the quality breakthrough of domestic mobile phones□Reporter Yang Zhangyu of the Southern Metropolis Daily reported that last Saturday, Liu Lirong, chairman of Golden Field Communication, said in an interview with the Southern Metropolis Daily in Shenzhen that the biggest gap between domestic mobile phones and foreign brands is brand, and said that domestic mobile phones should break the brand gap with quality, and at the same time emphasized that the biggest obstacle to the quality breakthrough of domestic mobile phones is the existence of clones. In view of the fierce competition in the mobile phone industry at present, Liu Lirong believes that the mobile phone industry is a huge and sustainable industry, and the gross profit margin of mobile phones can still reach 50%. As long as the manufacturers have excellent products and outstanding management, they can still make a lot of profits in the market. When it comes to Gionee itself, Liu Lirong stressed that Gionee would not pursue beautiful sales data, but would pursue the maximization of interests. He revealed that the sales target for Kingmax this year is set at 8 million units, and the product strategy will still focus on mid-range products, and will not sink to the low-end market. Reporter of the Times: What do you think is the biggest gap between domestic mobile phones and foreign brands now that they have developed to the present? Liu Lirong: The biggest difference between domestic mobile phones and foreign brands is still in the brand. I think the domestic mobile phones are very unfortunate. Now, many middle and high-end consumers do not even touch domestic mobile phones. Most of them buy foreign brand mobile phones. In fact, the functions and cost-effectiveness of many domestic mobile phones are already very good, and the quality has also been improved. The reporter asked, what do you think is the reason that the middle and high-end consumers do not contact domestic mobile phones? Liu Lirong: There are two main reasons: First, consumers in the mainland are more concerned about face than those in some developed regions, and they always feel that buying foreign brand mobile phones is more face-saving; Second, because foreign brand mobile phones were of better quality than domestic brand mobile phones a few years ago, they attracted many middle and high-end consumers. They have already gotten used to the fixed functions and operation interface of a certain foreign brand, and they will feel uncomfortable when they switch to other brand mobile phones. Of course, except for some consumers who pursue the fashion of mobile phones. With quality control and breakthroughs, how should domestic mobile phones turn around consumers\\' habits and make them switch to domestic mobile phones? A reporter from the Beijing Times asked. Liu Lirong: For domestic mobile phones, there is only one breakthrough, that is, to strictly control the quality of mobile phone products, and it must be sustained; apart from that, they should also pay attention to the humanized design of mobile phone products, so that consumers can easily get started with the use of mobile phones. Domestic mobile phones must not be like domestic mobile phone industry in its early days in 2001 and 2002, when many domestic consumers switched to buy domestic mobile phones to try. Unfortunately, at that time, domestic mobile phones only focused on sales and did not focus on quality, which disappointed a batch of consumers with economic power and first-time purchase of domestic mobile phones, and turned to buy relatively better quality foreign brand mobile phones. Thus, the more domestic mobile phones were sold at that time, the more consumers were harmed, and the damage to the brand of domestic mobile phones was greater. I think for domestic mobile phones, it is \"the previous generation cut the trees, and the next generation can only develop\". We can only take one step at a time, establish our own brand, and gradually change the views of domestic consumers with time. Reporter of the Times: Are there any specific requirements for the quality of the mobile phone? Liu Lirong: We have always attached great importance to the quality of mobile phone products, and we require ourselves to \"golden quality, establish the world\", striving to improve the quality of mobile phone products, and make more consumers use or use Golden Field mobile phones again.']\n"

Sina Finance News, January 25, 2022, A+H shares continued to show a weak situation with more declines than increases; the Hang Seng A+H premium index increased by 0.09 points to 121.1 points; the number of inverted stocks after the market closed increased to eight. The weekend was quiet, and the Hong Kong and mainland stock markets rebounded from the bottom on Friday, taking advantage of the single-day turnaround of financial stocks under the expectation of interest rate hikes. However, the offensive force in the afternoon trading today has become weak. Shenhu A-shares and Hong Kong H-shares opened lower but recovered losses briefly, but due to insufficient follow-up shares under tighter regulation, the index gradually lost its morning gains, closing down about 1% for both A and H-shares for the day. The A-share turnover shrank significantly to about 16 billion yuan (A-share); the turnover of H-shares also shrank significantly to about 17.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (H-share). With no response from the regulatory authorities to the expectation of interest rate hikes, financial stocks generally gave back their gains. China Construction Bank (601988-CN; 03988-HK) disclosed a 40 billion yuan A-share convertible bond plan and sought shareholder authorization to increase the issuance of A and H shares. The market was concerned that the fundraising plan would trigger a \"water extraction\" by peers, and the A and H shares fell by 0.5% and 2.1%, respectively. The A and H share premium rate (considering the latest exchange rate factor: 1 Hong Kong dollar = 0.87833 yuan) narrowed slightly to 24%. Crude oil stocks also fell slightly in line with the decline in international oil prices. Metal resources and power stocks A strong H weak; highway, maritime, building materials and environmental protection stocks are mostly H up A down, offsetting the effect of widening the price difference between the two markets. The aviation stocks saw significant declines in both markets.

Vanke Group, as a leader in the real estate industry, has its own product system. Any new real estate development will give customers a reason to buy, with the core of the entire design plan being to meet customer needs, establish the core selling points of the product, i.e., product, quality, and integrity. Vanke\\'s \"Golden\" series of premium residences is committed to refining the details of daily life and creating a sense of belonging with a mature cultural atmosphere. With a more avant-garde and modern concept of superior living in the central area, it guides the new fashion of urban living. This time, Xicheng went north, and Vanke Group took on the construction of Xicheng\\'s population relief resettlement houses, and together with Zhuzong, it acquired 550,000 square meters of land in Dong Shangdi to build a large-scale project - Zhuzong Vanke · Jinyi Huafu. Vanke set it as the \"golden\" series products, mainly to create a dedicated residence for IT elites in the Zhongguancun and Shang region, to improve their living environment and alleviate the housing pressure in these areas. According to the statistics in 2010, the supply of residential properties in the core area of Zhongguancun was only 4.5 million square meters. The land resources were scarce and the supply was too small, and the \"pure\" residential projects were extremely scarce. The area to the east of Shangdi is relatively quiet, suitable for living, and is not far from Zhongguancun, with convenient transportation. Lines 13, 8 and Changping can all reach the core business districts of Zhongguancun, Guoao, Financial Street, etc. conveniently. If you drive yourself, you can also reach the above places by Jingzang Expressway and Jingbao Expressway, which is called \"three tracks and two highways, three-dimensional transportation\". Vanke\\'s executive even referred to the Zhutong Vanke · Jinyi Huafu project as a \"thunderbolt in the real estate market\". In his view, the area of Shangdi East where the project is located is close to the Shangdi High-tech Park and the area of high-level universities, and it can accommodate many international well-known high-tech industries such as Lenovo, Baidu, and Fangzheng. At the same time, it is adjacent to the Xicheng district in Shangdi East, and it can enjoy the high-quality education of Xicheng district. It comprehensively demonstrates the two major advantages of the IT circle and educational facilities in the Jingbei area. And with the protection of two well-known brands, Zhetong and Vanke, the project itself perfectly interprets the life of urban elites. The project adheres to Vanke\\'s一贯standard of finished decoration for delivery, with flexible space and high utilization rate. With the unique \"dual-core\" spatial planning and landscape design, the building and landscape are organically integrated, and the distance between buildings reaches 130 meters. And in the garden design, a growth park for children was created, which will set up graffiti walls, glass plaques, Disciple Regulations, Milky Way Solar System, world map, Three Character Classic, etc. for children to play, of course, there are also facilities suitable for different age groups to relax and entertain, which reflects the care for the whole life cycle. Here, you can find a corner of silence in the hustle and bustle, and enjoy a touch of seclusion in the prosperity, striving for a beautiful and comfortable living environment. The project has a wide range of high-quality medical resources, including PLA No. 309 Hospital, Huilongguan Hospital, Qinghe Hospital, etc., which are convenient for medical treatment and physical examination. There are also good places for eating, drinking, playing, and having fun, such as Eon International Mall, Xing Mei Shopping Mall, Xidan Shopping Mall Huilongguan Mall, and Huazhong Department Store, all of which are located near the project. Phase one of the Zhutong Vanke Jinyu Huafu project mainly promotes two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments ranging from 85 to 105 square meters. 1000 units of housing are released at once.

But Yi Jianlian will not join the national team for training immediately. In the next half a month, he will rest, and cheering for the final of the team he used to play for, Guangdong, has become the most important thing on his schedule. Last night, Guangdong team staged a thrilling comeback in the fourth quarter after falling 18 points behind in Xinjiang away game, and Yi Jianlian, who had already arrived in Beijing, watched the game on the TV.

I hope they can play better in their next match. When it comes to the Xinjiang team, Yi Jianlian said, \"The Xinjiang team has indeed improved a lot in this season, including the strength of the domestic players, the strength of the foreign players, and the strength of the substitutes.\" It should be said that the final will be a great challenge for both sides. After watching the first two finals games, Zhou Yuan was also amazed by Du Bi\\'s strong scoring ability. He said, \"Dubi did play a very important role in Xinjiang team. In the first game, he got 53 points, which was indeed not well controlled in this aspect.\" The second game, he scored 36 points, which is a normal level he has maintained in the regular season, so his control should have improved. In the following games, defending DuBo will still be the team\\'s top priority. When the reporter asked Yi Jianlian to predict the final score, he smiled and said, \"I haven\\'t thought about predicting, because I have a preference. Guangdong is the team I used to play for, so I will definitely support Guangdong more.\" Although unwilling to make specific predictions about the final score, Alain still looked forward to the games to come, saying, \"From the strength, who can win the final championship still depends on the performance and the performance of both sides on the spot. Now both teams have lost one home game, and every game after that is very important to both sides. Finally, Ah Lian also made a summary of Guangdong team\\'s performance in this season. Yi Jianlian said, \"Guangdong team has experienced a lot of difficulties this season, including the old players such as Zhou Fangyuan and Wang Shipeng, who have been injured, and the big foreign player (Harrison) was injured at the beginning of the season. It can be said that they have played very hard in the regular season, but they still performed very well in such difficult situations. Next, Yi Jianlian will go to Dongguan to watch the fourth game of the CBA final of this season and cheer for his home team - Guangdong team. (Jialei)']\n"

It should be said that this action indicates that the Sunshine Institution is optimistic about the future market. From the dynamic TOP display of the compass, the main force capital was still heavily accumulating the Chinese stock market this Monday, and the big reversal of the market yesterday was also normal given the continuous decline of the market.

It can be seen that the market wind vane shows that funds have reached the state of being long for 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, and 10 days. So when the global stock market is booming and a large amount of funds are entering the Chinese stock market, how will the direction of the future market be? Blind optimism should not be encouraged. We should see the main trend of the current market as a sideways market, and the change in market trends first requires a change in capital. Through the dynamic TOP software display of the compass, the market trend indicator of the main market today (Tuesday) showed signs of the main force funds fleeing after a sharp rise, indicating that the main force is not very optimistic about the future market trend.

One, admission scams target parents\\' desire for their children to attend a prestigious school, and scammers often set up four types of traps: \"prestigious schools\" turn into private schools. Scammers often promise that senior three graduates can study at top universities, but after accepting \"relationship fees\" and \"sponsoring fees\", they arrange for students to attend privately-run colleges that can be paid for; \"art schools\" become \"art classes\". Scammers boast of being able to help candidates enter art schools, and then send students to privately-run art tutoring classes after defrauding them of a large sum of \"bribe money\". Special recruitment for military academies. Scammers claim to be the relatives or friends of military commanders, or simply call themselves high-ranking officers, and lie that they have a special admission quota for a certain military school. After receiving money, they disappear. “Point and招” attract. Scammers take advantage of the lack of understanding among examinees and their parents about the \"point admission\" policy of pilot universities, exaggerate the \"secrets\" behind it, and carry out fraud under the guise of helping graduates obtain a \"point admission\" quota. Two, job hunting traps, some candidates go out to work after the college entrance examination, and fraudsters often set up three kinds of traps for such students under the guise of employment introduction offices and employment intermediaries. No introduction, only fees: scammers collect high job introduction fees from graduates and then disappear; Reserving probationary periods: promising high salaries and using the guise of probation to cheaply exploit the labor of graduates; Various fees: fabricating various names for fees, such as risk deposit, training fees, uniform fees, and file establishment fees. III. Internet Traps After students take the college entrance examination, they have more time to surf the Internet, but their ability to distinguish right from wrong and resist negative information is relatively weak, making them prone to becoming addicted to online pornography. IV. \"Bro\" Trap Now, most of the senior three graduates are \"90s\", with a strong sense of curiosity, prone to impulsiveness, and are in a \"sheep herding\" state after the college entrance examination in terms of management. At this time, some senior three graduates mistakenly associate with bad social youths, and in the name of \"brotherhood\", they commit acts of provocation, group fighting, and other illegal behaviors. Five, pyramid scheme con artists often appear as the relatives and friends or fellow townspeople of senior three graduates, inciting graduates to make a lot of money by taking advantage of the time waiting for admission notices, using high returns and quick wealth as bait, and deceiving them. In addition to strengthening the crackdown on criminal and illegal elements, public security organs remind parents and candidates of the following five situations: First, they should register for higher education through normal channels, so as not to give illegal elements an opportunity; second, they should carefully distinguish the authenticity of various intermediaries, and do not \"seek medical treatment in a hurry\"; finally, parents should strengthen the supervision of candidates to prevent them from being cheated and committing crimes and illegal acts.']\n"

The International Department of Beijing No.1 High School attaches equal importance to international courses and Chinese cultural courses. In addition to international courses, students also need to study Chinese language and literature, Chinese history and politics, etc. Students in the International Department of No.11 Middle School also have to study history, geography and other courses. Students in the SFC-USA Experimental Class at Capital Normal University High School can choose from courses required for applying to American universities in five major learning areas: art, language and literature, humanities and social sciences. Students going abroad should have basic knowledge of world art and culture, but they should not forget the basic knowledge of Chinese history and geography. In the \"overseas class\" of model high schools such as No. 4 High School and No. 8 High School, in order to enable students to prepare more targetedly for overseas exams, the school specially designed relevant courses for students. In addition to arranging basic courses and examination courses such as mathematics and Chinese, the school also offers courses in Chinese and foreign art appreciation, Chinese history and geography, etc. Zhou Bin, deputy director of the International Department of No. 11 School, said that Chinese culture is the root of the students. The International Department is recruiting excellent students who are determined to go abroad and cultivate them into international talents. Moreover, students can better promote the excellent culture of their motherland when they go abroad in the future after studying Chinese culture. If you do not understand the history and culture of your own country and nation, how can you stand on your own feet when you go abroad. It is believed by insiders that high schools conducting cooperative education with foreign countries meets the needs of the times. In a few years, top talents should be people with an \"international background, global vision, and Chinese soul.\" There are two types of \"overseas classes\" in model high schools: one is set up for overseas students according to the needs of students and their parents, and the senior three students in the class basically only apply for foreign universities by taking the high school entrance examination; the other is an international class. High schools cooperate with or introduce foreign middle school courses. Students start to learn foreign courses in the first year of high school and apply to foreign universities directly after graduating from the third year of high school. Some senior high schools have both types of classes. (Reporter: Ma Haili)']\n"

      "['杨力,唐正东,胡雪峰,雪峰,易立,孟达,王敏,大唐,王总,刁勇', '正向', 'The four mainstays of Nansteel still refuse to renew their contracts. The upper management denied the rumors: as one of the five tigers of Nansteel, Yang Li signed a provisional contract for the new season on the evening of April 4. Then rumors spread online that Nansteel’s remaining main players would be signed up one by one, and the club would settle all the contracts within this week. Yesterday, after multiple interviews with the reporters of our newspaper, the results were quite different from the rumors on the Internet. The club and the remaining four players are still in a game, and neither side has shown any signs of compromise. It is not impossible that the four mainstays, Tang Zhengdong, Hu Xuefeng, Yi Li and Meng Da, will miss the first game of the new season against Dongguan. The game continued, and the players showed no sign of compromise. Yesterday, a website reported that several main players in Jiangsu were ready to compromise with Nansteel Club, and quoted a player as saying, \"Do you sign this contract in front of you or not?\" By now, what can we do? The article says that the club\\'s previous \"divide and conquer\" and \"trench warfare\" tactics had already taken effect a week before the start of the league, \"With it this far, how could we not sign?\" In such a situation, it is easy to imagine the helplessness of the player. Wang Min, the general manager of Nansteel club, said in the article that there are only three main players whose contracts have not been signed yet, but we have been talking well, and we should be able to sign all the players in the next two days. The article states that, no matter how unwilling the players are, their big names written in black ink will eventually fall on what they see as an “unequal treaty.” Is it really as the online articles say? Last night, the reporters called several of the players involved, and the answer was the same: \"We have no intention of compromising. If we cannot reach an agreement with the club on some details, we may not play the first game of the new season.\" The words of the main player Meng Da represented the attitude of several main players: \"We are also waiting for the club to communicate with us. Now the whole salary pool has been determined, so we will not argue about the salaries.\" But the details of the uncontrollable factors such as injuries and illnesses still need to wait for the club to clarify, and we also have differences on the performance indicators. If Tangdang really doesn\\'t play, we definitely cannot accept the third place performance indicator. Journalists learned that, due to the resolute attitude of several key players, Nansteel club\\'s relevant leaders gave up on negotiating with the players at Nansteel hotel yesterday. And the reports that Yi Li and Hu Xuefeng basically accepted the club contract are not accurate. Hu Xuefeng, Yi Li and Meng Da are still in a game of contract with the club. If both sides of labor and capital do not give in, it is not impossible for the main players to miss the first game of the new season. Of course, this is a scene that we are unwilling to see. The senior management of Wang Min called for injustice: \"I never thought of dragging the contract\" Yesterday, an article on the Internet infuriated Wang Min, the general manager of Nansteel Club, who said that the general manager of the club was in a victorious posture, \"We will try to sign a contract with them in the next two or three days, and I think there will be a good result.\" The article also said that the club\\'s repeated talks with the players were just a ruse, and the club\\'s statement was that it didn\\'t matter whether the players signed or not, and in the end, everyone could still be friends. It is actually to give the players a sense of \"aloofness from the high place\". Wang Min strongly condemned such irresponsible statements: \"First of all, I would like to clarify that the club\\'s attitude towards contract negotiations with players and coaches is sincere. The contract has not been resolved until now, and the club is very anxious. It is not as some media say that the club does not care, and that players will naturally sign contracts after the games start.\" Second, I communicated with Yi Li and Hu Xuefeng yesterday afternoon, although there are still some differences on some details, the club\\'s attitude is very positive. We understand the concerns of the players, and the club is negotiating internally to resolve the contract issues as soon as possible, after all, the league is about to start, and if it is delayed, it will inevitably affect Nansteel\\'s performance in the new season. Finally, the club will certainly focus on the contract issue in the coming days and will not allow things to develop to the point of affecting the first match. Tomorrow, Nansteel Club will hold a press conference for the new season. Wang\\'s expectation is: to solve the contract issue before the press conference, so that all players can devote themselves to the new season. Reporter Diao Yong of the local newspaper']\n"

According to the report by Luo Yi, a reporter, and Liu Fei, a trainee, on a certain day, a college in Wuhan has a shameless girl! Living with her boyfriend in the dorm for nearly a year has already driven away two roommates! The post was crazily forwarded on major domestic websites and forums. It is mentioned in the post that a girl in a dormitory of a key university in Wuchang, Hubei, not only stayed for a year without permission, but even opened a \"couple online store\" in the boy\\'s dormitory. Due to their \"close relationship\", the two \"forced\" two other male students who were supposed to live in the same dormitory to leave, causing a bad impact on campus. The post on Tianya.com, which was exposed, was clicked 580,000 times in four days. The post described how the woman and her boyfriend \"stayed up late and got up late, hugging each other to sleep,\" and their \"main business\" was to open a store on Taobao and run a private server for a certain online game. According to the content of the post, the boyfriend of the girl who stayed there basically did not go to class, did not go out to activities, cheated in exams, and the girl who stayed there was listed with more than ten offenses by the poster, including \"using the toilet in the boys\\' dormitory directly\". In addition, the post also attached photos of the two people sleeping in the dormitory, but the photos were very blurry, and from the angle, they were all secretly taken from the door. The poster said that his counselor and secretary had talked to the person involved, but without effect. Posting online is because there is no other way, and the intention is to make it public to solve the problem. This post has been reposted on many domestic websites and forums, and the number of clicks on this post alone on Tianya Forum exceeded 580,000 in just four days. In the replies of netizens, the reporter saw that most netizens expressed contempt for the girl and her boyfriend\\'s behavior, even demanding that the girl be \"human flesh searched\". Nearly one-third of the netizens questioned the school\\'s dormitory management level. Some netizens also think that people should be rational, and should not blame the school, or even insult the students involved, and give them a chance to repent. The self-styled party member posted on the school BBS to clarify yesterday afternoon. After the journalist browsed the school BBS, he found that a netizen named \"xiangjuzi\" posted at 18 o\\'clock in the early morning, \"As one of the parties involved, I must clarify a few issues.\" The post confirmed the identity of the student couple, and from the perspective of the parties involved, it said, \"A girl with a thick face has appeared at a university in Wuhan!\" Living with her boyfriend in the dorm for nearly a year has already driven away two roommates! After refuting some views that were inconsistent with the post, it was stated that the rest was consistent with the facts. The male lead of the incident has promised to apologize to us, and may go out to rent a house in the near future. The female has returned to her hometown in Shandong recently. “xiangjuzi” said that the three of us failed to express our stance in time, which led to the deterioration of the incident, and we are also responsible for this. He hopes that this will not affect the reputation of the school and emphasizes, \"After all, it feels a bit like crossing the moral bottom line, but there is absolutely no such behavior as some netizens speculated, please be careful.\" “the girl moved out more than 20 days ago” The reporter learned from the administrator of the school’s male dormitory building No. 4 in the afternoon of yesterday that the dormitory mentioned in the post was not in building No. 4, but in room 306 of building No. 7. Then the reporter went to the dormitory in Building 7, where the building manager told him that the girl had moved out more than 20 days ago. The administrator acknowledged that the female student mentioned in the post had once lived in the male dormitory 306, but she said, \"That female student came and went, and did not stay as long as stated in the post.\" The administrator said that after the incident, the school leaders had already done some work with the couple of students. The dormitory originally housed four boys, and the area was relatively spacious. The two students who moved out to live elsewhere did so voluntarily and were not forced to do so by the couple. Linking the thread to list the crimes of \"thick-faced women\" in the original text. 1. Directly use the boys\\' dormitory as a toilet; 2. Haven\\'t seen a woman wash clothes, cook, or clean for half a year; 3. Haven\\'t seen this woman\\'s underwear (underwear) hung near the dormitory; 4. Solve the bathing problem in the boys\\' dormitory building in summer; 5. Do not participate in all final exams; 6. The total time away from the boys\\' dormitory in half a year is estimated to be less than 200 hours; 7. Almost never talk to people other than her boyfriend; 8. The two of them have always slept on the same bed, and do not pull a curtain; 9. Dominate others\\' computers, continue to dominate even if the owner returns and watches the computer; 10. Still able to surf the Internet as if no one is around when the counselor talks to her boyfriend; 11. After the counselor expressed that she would never come again, she continued to restore everything as before on the third day; 12.

Off the screen, he is a family man who worries about buying a house and supports his wife and children. Yesterday, the article appeared with the TV drama \"Home\" in Shanghai, and the cast of \"Home\" said seriously that many people in \"Home\" faced marriage problems, \"My marriage is not a problem.\" He said this in public because there were rumors recently that his wife, Ma Yili, had a divorce. The article sniffed at it: \"I don\\'t care about these groundless fake news.\" The article says that his married life is very happy. At home, he is the breadwinner, while Ma Yili is both the breadwinner and the homemaker. For a while, he was so busy that his daughter did not want to see him. He reflected on himself and arranged more time to spend with his wife and children. When the reporter asked him if he thought he was a good father, he confidently replied, \"I hope that when you have the opportunity to ask my daughter this question, she will say that I am a good father.\" The article says that his understanding of \"80s men\" is that they dare to challenge themselves and take on responsibilities. He admits that there is a shadow of himself in his roles, and his views on love. In \"Living in a Snail\\'s Shell,\" his girlfriend, who loved him to death, ultimately left him for the sake of material interests in reality.

The number of test sites for this year\\'s college entrance examination in Beijing has been allocated, with 123 test sites, 15 fewer than last year due to a significant decrease in the number of candidates. Currently, each district and county has started to test the video surveillance equipment of the examination sites. During the college entrance examination, the \"electronic eyes\" will patrol all the examination rooms. This year\\'s college entrance examination is the one with the fewest candidates in the city in six years, with only 80,241 candidates, a decrease of more than 20,000 candidates compared to last year, with a decline of 20%. The reduction in candidates has led some districts to adjust the settings of examination sites. It was revealed that there are 10 examination centers in Dongcheng District this year, one less than last year, and there are 14 examination centers in Xicheng District, which have also been adjusted. The decrease in candidates in Haidian District this year is lower than the average decrease in the city, and nearly one-fifth of the candidates in the city come from Haidian. There are three less and one more examination sites in this district this year, according to the distribution of candidates. The three examination sites that were responsible for the examination last year will no longer be responsible for the examination, and a new examination site will be added in the area where the candidates are relatively concentrated. This week, each district will inspect and adjust the video surveillance equipment, air conditioners, and loudspeakers of the examination schools. Before the college entrance examination, the city will conduct two rounds of joint adjustments for all the \"electronic eyes\" of the examination sites to ensure that the equipment is operating normally. During the college entrance examination, the remote electronic patrol system of the education examination will cover all the examination rooms. With the implementation of online marking for college entrance examination mathematics, the city will achieve online marking for all subjects for the first time this year. When the examinees answer the questions, they need to write the answers on the designated answer sheet. Online marking will take place with back-to-back, two teachers per question, and if the score difference between the two teachers exceeds the limit, a third teacher will be involved in the marking. Online marking will minimize human factors, reduce the error rate of score verification, improve efficiency, and ensure the fairness and justice of the examination. Since this year is the first college entrance examination for the new senior high school curriculum, the structure of the test paper, the distribution of scores, the design of question types, the method of marking, and the admission form have all been adjusted. In order to better formulate college entrance examination questions, ensure the smooth conduct of the college entrance examination, and also to test the adaptability of candidates to the new college entrance examination, the city has now completed a \"simulation test\" for more than 5,000 candidates in some districts and counties on the trial examination and online marking. The test data will provide a reference for ensuring the smooth conduct of the examination. Before the college entrance examination, each high school will also remind candidates of the precautions to take, so that they can take the exam calmly. (Reporter: Liu Hao)']\n"

Jilin News (Reporter Jiang Yanyan, Correspondent Gao Mingzhong, Liu Yiping) A fake ID costing 700 yuan was used to defraud 800,000 yuan in cash from a friend. The Panshi Public Security Bureau cracked a major case of contract fraud recently. Zhang Laozhao, the victim, is the legal representative of a catering service company in Panshi City. In December 2008, Lao Zhang\\'s good friend introduced him to one of his friends. My friend said that this friend who started a business is Wang Xiankui, who operates agricultural supplies. The company is called Jilin Province Pan Shi City Boyang Agricultural Science and Technology Co., Ltd. Due to the problem of capital turnover, he wants to borrow some money from Old Zhang and proposes to pay interest. Old Zhang reluctantly agreed out of politeness and proposed to use the property in Futa Town, Panshi City as collateral. Wang Xiankui initially found it difficult, but eventually agreed. After Old Zhang received the property rights certificate and the land use certificate of Wang Xiankui\\'s company, he lent 800,000 yuan in cash to Wang Xiankui twice in December 2008 and January 2009. In mid-August this year, the due date for repayment arrived, and Old Zhang was preparing to ask Wang Xiankui for money. But instead of getting the money, he learned that Wang Xiankui had sold the property of Boyang Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. Old Zhang was puzzled, \"The property certificate and the land certificate are in my hands, how can the house be sold?\" Call Wang Xiankui again, but find that the other party has already turned off the phone. Old Zhang only then realized that he had been cheated. He first took Wang Xiankui\\'s mortgage property certificate and land certificate to the Panshi City Real Estate Trading Center. After verification, the property certificate numbers in his hand were all correct, but the certificates were fake, and the property had really been transferred to the Panshi branch of a company in Shenyang. After being defrauded, Old Zhang reported the case to the Panshi Public Security Bureau. After receiving Zhang Lao\\'s report to the police, the police in Panshi quickly organized a force to investigate and solve the case, and apprehended the suspect Wang Xiankui on the same day. After interrogation, Wang Xiankui admitted that in recent years, due to poor management, he had accumulated a large amount of external debt, and basically relied on borrowing from others to maintain a fragile capital chain. When he learned from his friend that Old Zhang needed his company\\'s property as collateral, he went to Changchun City to make fake documents and spent 700 yuan to make a fake house ownership certificate and a fake land use certificate at a price of 350 yuan each. He used these fake certificates to defraud 800,000 yuan in cash from Old Zhang. Currently, Wang Xiankui has been criminally detained by the Panshi police, and the case is under further investigation.']\n"

      "['陶然,陶宏开,无知,胡安戈', '正向', 'Beijing Evening News: Internet addiction exemption is a huge misunderstanding. On November 8, the first \"Diagnosis Standard of Internet Addiction\" in China passed the expert argument, and will be promoted and used in the national major hospitals, especially the psychiatry departments of the tertiary hospitals, after being reported to the Ministry of Health by the General Logistics Department of the People\\'s Liberation Army. This standard divides internet addiction into five categories: internet gaming addiction, internet pornography addiction, internet relationship addiction, internet information addiction, and internet transaction addiction. Internet addiction has been included in the scope of mental illness. According to the description of the diagnostic criteria, the most intuitive quantitative standard of internet addiction is that the average daily continuous online time reaches or exceeds 6 hours, and the symptoms have met the criteria for more than 3 months. Other criteria include a strong craving or impulse to use the Internet; withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anger, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances when reducing or stopping Internet use; and a reduction or abandonment of other interests, leisure, or social activities due to Internet use. Dr. Tao Ran, the head of the Department of Medical Addiction of the Beijing Military Area General Hospital, who is in charge of the topic, said that this standard is the conclusion they have drawn from the research of more than 3000 people over the past four years. If the standard is finally confirmed, our country will be the first in the world to list internet addiction as a mental disorder. Professor Tao Hongkai, the first person in China to quit internet addiction, openly opposes the diagnostic criteria. Based on his research of more than 5,000 cases, Tao Hongkai said, \"Internet addiction is not a disease, and it is not a crime either.\" I firmly oppose treating internet-addicted teenagers as mental patients and putting the label of \"mental patient\" on children who are addicted to the internet. Among netizens, supporters believe that categorizing internet addiction as a disease only means that we will be more professional, formal, and comprehensive in considering the behavioral disorders caused by internet use in the future, and have more scientific methods to prevent and control the negative consequences brought by the internet. And the opponents argue that mental illness cannot be so casually labeled. Then the internet cafe would become a madhouse? Some netizens said self-mockingly, \"I only know now that I am a mental patient.\" If internet addiction is a mental illness, then do those who rob and kill not have any crimes? The comment by \"Ignorant\" on the Internet represents the views of many people. The medical debate suddenly became entangled with legal issues. In people\\'s minds, mental patients can be exempt from legal responsibility for criminal acts. Does the inclusion of internet addiction in the category of mental illness mean that internet addicts do not have to bear legal responsibility for their behavior? Social doubts were quickly confirmed in reality. On the afternoon of November 10, an application for mental health evaluation was sent to the Higher People\\'s Court of Sichuan Province. The first application of the \"Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction\" was actually presented in a judicial trial. Huanganguo, a young man from Sheshan County, Sichuan Province, was addicted to online games at the age of 21. Last March, he claimed that he wanted to do a business in seawater and asked his parents to sponsor him. His father gave him 50,000 yuan, but Juancho spent all of it on gaming equipment. Juanego, who suddenly had an absurd idea, could not face his parents: \"I have disappointed my parents\\' expectations, why not end their lives and let them be completely relieved.\" On July 14 last year, he bought 20 packages of rat poison and put them in the leftover food at home. To create an alibi, he drove away from home. The father was poisoned after eating food laced with poison, but fortunately, he was rescued in time and escaped danger.']\n"

      "['梁文博,丁俊晖,威尔士,戴尔,达赫迪,斯威尔,奥沙利文,艾伯顿,古尔德,希金斯,乔治,Matt', '正向', 'Lang Wenbo became the second man in China after Ding Junhui. He is like an uncut diamond. Lang Wenbo will compete with local player Dale for a place in the main event of the 2009 Welsh Open qualification round. Before the match, we made a comprehensive assessment of Liang Wenbo\\'s strength. Chinese player Liang Wenbo was born in 1987. At the age of 21 last year, his world ranking was 40th and his temporary ranking was 21st. His bold playing style earned him the reputation of being fearless, and he was also given the nickname \"To or Not to Go\" by the media for his premature appearance at the World Championship due to misunderstanding the host\\'s meaning. Liang Wenbo\\'s best performance in a professional tournament was the quarterfinals of the World Championship in 2008, which was also the best performance of Chinese mainland players in the World Championship. In the 2006 Doha Asian Games, he won the silver medal in the individual event and the team championship, representing China, and he was also the champion of the IBSF 21-year-old championship in 2005. Overall evaluation: Liang Wenbo established his status as the second man in China Liang Wenbo, who was once unknown, made a stunning run to the quarter-finals in the 2008 World Championship, and his strong offensive style also won the favor of the Sheffield fans. He defeated the former world champion Doherty in the first round, and then narrowly won the deciding frame against the experienced veteran Swail. In his match against the eventual champion O\\'Sullivan, Li Wenbo also caused considerable trouble for his opponent. In the first ranking event of the season, Liang Wenbo swept former world champion Abbot 5-0 in Northern Ireland and advanced to the 16强. In the qualifying match of the Bahrain Championship in this season, Liang Wenbo scored his first 147 in his career and knocked out his opponent with two high breaks of 139 and 115, winning 5-1. Now, Liang Wenbo has become the second man in China’s army after Ding Junhui. Strength analysis: With the ability to enter the top 16 and become a star player, Liang Wenbo has amazing long-range offensive skills, and his striking speed and destructiveness are also praiseworthy. The calm attitude he showed in the competition also proved that he could handle the pressure on himself, and his sense of humor also made the audience like this young boy from the East. According to the British media, if Liang Wenbo could enter the top 16, he could become a star player. Weakness analysis: Aggressive play may become his Achilles\\' heel To some extent, his aggressive play is also his Achilles\\' heel. Li Wenbo\\'s fearless offensive style may bring him a mess that is hard to clean up, and Higgins once pointed out that if Li Wenbo\\'s style is always so open, it will be difficult for him to win against top players. Therefore, careful consideration of the timing of the attack would be beneficial to Liang Wenbo, and secondly, improving the quality of the safety ball is also an urgent matter for him. Prospect analysis:天赋毋庸置疑仍需脚踏实地Liang Wenbo is like an unpolished diamond. There is no doubt that he is a talented player, but he must be a player who is down-to-earth and a match player rather than a player who is a flash in the pan. The Bahrain Championship is a good example, where Liang Wenbo, after sweeping Gould with a maximum break, lost 2-5 to George subsequently. The older generation of players always warn the younger players to be modest and not arrogant, and the same applies to Liang Wenbo. After the competition and his own efforts, Liang Wenbo will have a brilliant day in the future. As a young player just entering the professional circuit, Li Wenbo\\'s future is bright, but how to carve out his own territory in an era of rising stars, Li Wenbo still has a lot to learn. As the season draws to a close, the Welsh Open is a great opportunity for him to earn points. (Matt)']\n"

      "['曾庆朝,梅安生,江维,邓红阳,王爱珍,方城县,区,尚玉冉,史福长,尚国富,小史店镇,尚玉然', '正向', 'A female worker in Henan Province was falsely employed for 10 years under a false name. The administrative organ helped forge the documents. This report was written by the reporter Zeng Qingchao, Mei Ansheng, and Jiang Wei. The reporter Deng Hongyang. The right to name is a specific personal right granted to every citizen by the constitution and law. No one shall forge, alter, or use it without legal procedures. However, in Nanyang, Henan Province, not only was a worker’s name usurped, but also, during the process, the relevant personnel of the county education committee helped the usurper forge false files, and the police station’s household registration police helped to alter the name, making a fake identity worker usurp the job for 10 years and become a people’s teacher. This triggered a rare case of infringement of the right to one’s name across the country. Recently, the case was concluded in the Intermediate People\\'s Court of Nanyang City. The impostor Wang Aizhen, the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau that colluded to swap files, and the Nanyang City Public Security Bureau of a certain district that altered household registration were ruled to be liable for their actions and were ordered to apologize to the young woman Shang Yurán, and to compensate her with 40,000 yuan for mental distress. There are legal experts who told the reporters of the Legal Daily that compensation is secondary in this case, and what is more important is that the relevant fraudsters have committed the crime of embezzlement and the crime of forging public documents. Identity information was impersonated for ten years. Shang Yurran was born in August 5, 1975 in Fangcheng County, Guzhuangdi Township, Nanyang City. On September 7, 1993, he moved from Guzhuangdi Township to Nanyang City, Xinhua Street. Applied for resident identity card on December 17, 2007. Wang Aizhen, a young woman, was born on February 30, 1971 in Fancun County, Yangliu Township, Fancun Village. In the summer of 1993, Wang Aizhen, through the introduction of Shi Fuchang, took the practical talent training class of Nanyang Normal University under the name of Shang Yurong through the relationship of Shang Guofu, Shang Yurong\\'s father. She graduated in 1995, and the names on the graduation certificate and file were still \"Shang Yurong\". Wang Aizhen was noted as an alias in the section of aliases. In 1997, Fangcheng County Government decided to recruit graduates of practical talents from Nanyang Normal University in 1995 to work in the education system, among whom was \"Shang Yurán\". On April 7, 1998, the Fangcheng County Personnel Bureau transferred \"Shang Yurán\" and 13 others to work in the education system. On September 4, 1998, the Fangcheng County Education Commission assigned \"Shang Yurán\" and 5 others to work at the Xiao Shidian Township Education Office, and \"Shang Yurán\" was assigned to teach at the Second Junior High School of Xiao Shidian Township. In September 2007, \"Shang Yurán\" was transferred to teach at the First Junior High School of Xiao Shidian Town. Then the real Shang Yurran was hired as a public contract worker by a printing factory in Nanyang in 1994. The factory began to enter a state of production shutdown since 1997, and applied for bankruptcy on June 27, 2008. It was declared bankrupt on August 10, 2009. According to the judge, Wang Aizhen borrowed Shang Yurran\\'s recruitment file during the process of Wang Aizhen being transferred to work in the education system, and Shang Yurran has already become \"Shang Yurran\". On March 26, 1998, the Fangcheng County Personnel Bureau issued a notice to the Fangcheng County Economic and Trade Commission, transferring \"Shang Yurán\" to work at the Education Commission. On March 28, 1998, the Fangcheng County Printing Factory notified the County Economy and Trade Commission of the introduction letter of \"Shang Yurran\". In April 1998, the Fangcheng County Personnel Bureau notified the Fangcheng County Education Commission to handle the labor procedures for \"Shang Yuran\". On September 16, 2006, Wang Aizhen processed a second-generation ID card with the name and ID information as \"Shang Yurán\" and a photo of Wang Aizhen. On November 25, 2007, Wang Aizhen handled a second-generation ID card with the name \"Shang Yuran\" and the basic information and photo of Wang Aizhen. In November 2007, the real Shang Yuruan went to the local police station with a household registration book to handle the second-generation ID card, but after the household registration police officer checked, it was found that Shang Yuruan\\'s ID card had already been issued. Shang Yurran reported to the relevant authorities after discovering that her ID information was being used by Wang Aizhen. Subsequently, the relevant departments of Fangcheng County ordered the Fangcheng County Personnel and Labor Bureau, Fangcheng County Printing Factory, Fangcheng County Economic and Trade Commission, Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau, and a Public Security Bureau to write a written reply to this matter. On April 25, 2008, the Fangcheng County Human Resources Bureau canceled Wang Aizhen\\'s employee status, while Shang Yurán still belonged to the printing factory. On August 26, 2008, the public security authorities made a decision to revoke the household registration of \"Shang Yuran\". On September 5, 2008, Wang Aizhen obtained a temporary ID card, with the name still being Wang Aizhen (the same as the ID number of Wang Aizhen currently). On October 9, 2008, the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau decided to revoke Wang Aizhen\\'s relevant certificates and documents obtained by replacing others. The victim sued for the right to name in 2009. On May 21, 2009, Shang Yurran sued Wang Aizhen to the Fangcheng County People\\'s Court on the grounds of infringing on the right to name, requesting that the court order Wang Aizhen, District Public Security Bureau, Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau, and Fangcheng County Xiaoshi Town First Junior High School to immediately stop the infringement, apologize to the plaintiff, and jointly compensate the plaintiff for 79,338 yuan in salary losses, 662 yuan in transportation fees, and 70,000 yuan in mental damage, totaling 150,000 yuan. It was found that Shang Yurán had graduated from high school and did not attend the study at Nanyang Normal College, and had no teaching qualification certificate. At present, Shang Yurán is on the list of workers after the bankruptcy of the printing factory. On July 1, 2010, the Fangcheng County People\\'s Court, after trial, held that Wang Aizhen\\'s act of using a false name for Shang Yurang existed, which violated the mandatory provisions of the law and constituted an infringement of Shang Yurang\\'s right to his name. In the process of Wang Aizhen\\'s recruitment and employment, Wang Aizhen used Shang Yurang\\'s recruitment file, which also constituted an infringement of Shang Yurang. But since the printing factory has been in a state of production stagnation since 1997, in fact, Wang Aizhen\\'s infringement has not caused any actual damage to Shang Yurran. Wang Aizhen intentionally altered \"然\" to \"冉\" during the process of obtaining a second-generation ID card, and subjectively had the intention to do so, which also constituted an infringement of Shang Yuruan\\'s right to his name. Although it caused Shang Yuruan to be unable to obtain an ID card in November 2007, it was promptly corrected by the public security organs and did not cause Shang Yuruan any actual harm. Therefore, Wang Aizhen\\'s infringement of Shang Yurang\\'s right to name is established, but Shang Yurang has not participated in the education system work, and has been enjoying the social minimum living security as a laid-off worker of the printing factory since 2005. Therefore, the court does not support Shang Yurang\\'s request for compensation of 79,338 yuan for wages. Wang Aizhen\\'s infringement of Shang Yurang\\'s right to name has caused a certain mental injury to Shang Yurang, and the court awards 10,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress and apologizes to Shang Yurang. The Fancun County Education and Sports Bureau was negligent in the process of enrolling students and workers, and had serious misconduct. In an objective sense, it jointly committed the act of infringing on Shang Yurang\\'s right to his name with Wang Aizhen. According to the law, it should bear civil liability. The Fancun County Education and Sports Bureau is ordered to compensate Shang Yurang 20,000 yuan for mental distress and apologize. An error occurred in the process of a public security bureau in Nanyang handling certificates, but it was immediately confiscated and corrected after the fact, and no actual damage was caused, so the public security bureau should not bear responsibility. Wang Aizhen was assigned to work at Xiaoshi Town No.2 Junior High School, not at the current No.1 Junior High School. Therefore, Xiaoshi Town No.1 Junior High School should not bear the responsibility. In addition, Shang Yurran asked Wang Aizhen to compensate for her petitioning travel expenses of 662 yuan, but the court did not support it. Shang Yurran asked Wang Aizhen to stop infringing immediately, as the police station had canceled the ID card of \"Shang Yuran\" and the ID card with Wang Aizhen\\'s photo and Shang Yurran\\'s basic information, and the Fangcheng County Human Resources Bureau had canceled Wang Aizhen\\'s false identity as Shang Yurran in the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau, and the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau had canceled Wang Aizhen\\'s false identity as Shang Yurran\\'s relevant qualification certificates, and Shang Yurran\\'s work relationship had also been restored to the printing factory, so her request had been actually resolved. After the second trial awarded 40,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress, Shang Yurang believed that Wang Aizhen not only infringed on her right to her name, but also on her right to employment, causing her to be unemployed for over a decade and unable to receive remuneration. During Wang Aizhen\\'s infringement, a Public Security Bureau, an Education Bureau, and No. 1 Junior High School helped to plot and plan, jointly completed the infringement, and constituted joint infringement. The Public Security Bureau and No. 1 Junior High School of Xiaoshi Town should also bear civil joint and several liability for compensating all their losses totaling 150,000 yuan. In order to do so, Shang Yurang appealed. I participated in the practical talent training class of Normal College under the name of Shang Yurran with the consent and personal operation of Shang Yurran\\'s father. There was no intention of stealing or maliciously impersonating, so I should not bear the responsibility of compensating for mental distress. Shang Yurran worked in the printing factory first, and I entered the education system later. The employment rights of the two people were not affected. Moreover, because Shang Yurran sued me, I lost my job, and now I have no ability to compensate. Thus, Wang Aizhen also appealed. The Education Bureau of Fangcheng County also appealed on the grounds that \"there was no fault subjectively, and it should not bear the liability for compensation and joint liability.\" On December 3, the Intermediate People\\'s Court of Nanyang City held a second public trial and found that Wang Aizhen, under the name of Shang Yurang, enrolled in the Practical Talent Training Class of Nanyang Normal University, and later obtained the qualification of a full-time contract teacher by using Shang Yurang\\'s employment file to engage in educational activities. Although Wang Aizhen claimed that she had informed Shang Yurang\\'s father, Shang Guofu, and that he was aware of it, it cannot be determined that Shang Yurang himself agreed to use his name. The use of Shang Yurang\\'s name has infringed upon his right to use his name, and Wang Aizhen should bear the main liability for the fault. Nanyang Public Security Bureau committed a fault of strict review when it issued the ID card of \"Shang Yuran\" to Wang Aizhen, which objectively created conditions for Wang Aizhen and also constituted an infringement of Shang Yurang\\'s name, and should bear corresponding civil liability. The Fangcheng County Education Commission did not strictly review the relevant documents and procedures according to the conditions when recruiting personnel, which led to Wang Aizhen using Shang Yurans name to obtain admission qualifications. Later, it also processed the transfer procedures for her, and there were obvious wrongful behaviors, and should bear corresponding responsibilities for this. As the receiving unit, Xiaoshi Store Junior High School did not have any subjective fault, nor did it have the statutory duty to review Wang Aizhen\\'s use of Shang Yurang\\'s name, and did not have the intention or negligence to infringe on Shang Yurang\\'s name. Therefore, it does not bear civil liability for this. Based on the above determination of responsibility, the court ruled that Wang Aizhen should apologize to Shang Yuruan orally and compensate her for 20,000 yuan in mental distress. Nanyang Municipal Public Security Bureau apologized orally to Shang Yurán and compensated 10,000 yuan for mental distress. Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau orally apologized to Shang Yurran and compensated 10,000 yuan for mental distress. Third parties\\' statements are a fundamental requirement for law-based administration, which is the basic requirement of the strategy of governing the country according to law for each administrative organ. In accordance with relevant regulations and the Interim Provisions on the Accountability of Party and Government Leaders, which were issued and implemented by the central government on July 12, 2009, the local disciplinary inspection and supervision departments and the organization departments should, in accordance with the authority of cadre management, make administrative accountability decisions such as dismissal, resignation due to blame, and ordered resignation for relevant persons, and make organizational handling to warn the future and prevent similar incidents from happening. In addition, in addition to civil liability borne by the entity, the relevant persons involved in the case have also constituted the crime of embezzlement as stipulated in the Criminal Law, and criminal responsibility should also be pursued according to law.']\n"

As of last Friday, the Shangzheng Composite Index closed at 2374.44 points, up 93.35 points, with a rise of 4.09%; while the Shenzhen Composite Index closed at 8994.15 points, up 346.64 points, with a rise of 4.01%. While the index continued to rise, the trading volume in both markets continued to increase, with a total trading volume of 11106.4 billion yuan for the whole week, an increase of nearly 30% compared to the previous week. Based on the market performance this week, the launch of the weighty sector of banking stocks has indeed added momentum and confidence to the upward breakthrough of the market. In addition, the current market hotspots are rotating smoothly, and it is likely that the index will break the previous high of 2402 points this week. But it is particularly important to note that the rebound of the stock index in this wave should see an increase in volume as it rises, and the volume should also reach a new high when it reaches a new high. In particular, if the major weight sectors such as banks and real estate are making a strong move, the volume should be significantly increased. Otherwise, it is not excluded that it may be a bullish trap. In terms of market hotspots, with the change of the news, the banking, new Shanghai, solar energy, steel and other sectors have been clearly paid attention to by the off-market funds, and the non-ferrous metal sector even saw a large fluctuation with increased trading volume last week. We stick to the view that we should remain highly vigilant about the serious shrinkage of demand in the world and the huge increase in non-ferrous metals in the early stage under the financial crisis, and we are optimistic about the new Shanghai block with multiple favorable expectations such as the World Expo, international financial center, and international shipping center in the short term.']\n"

On the 7th, he specially took time off from Taiwan to Hong Kong, and held his first birthday party in Hong Kong for 220 fans from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and other places to celebrate his birthday. At the birthday party, good brother Dada Dong called to congratulate, sang the birthday song with the fans on the scene, and sent a scarf as a gift, which moved Chen Yiru greatly! Chen Yiru held his first birthday party in Hong Kong on November 7. Although fans from all over the world wanted to celebrate their idol\\'s birthday, venue problems ultimately meant that only 220 fans from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and other places could be invited. In addition to the birthday cake, the fan who had reserved a ticket also prepared a human-shaped cushion, a small teddy bear, a red egg, and flowers, and placed all the gifts on a long table to give to the idol, which made Chen Yiru pleasantly surprised! And Chen Yiru also prepared personalized signature towels, T-shirts, and thank-you cards to give back to the fans. Fans who were lucky enough to win the gifts could also take a photo with their idols as a memento. Fans all tried to hold on to Chen Yiru! In addition, Da Dong, a good brother, called to congratulate on his birthday, and then led the 220 fans on the scene to sing the birthday song through the phone. After that, the staff presented Da Dong with a Gucci scarf that he had brought from Hong Kong for Chen Yiru as a birthday gift, which moved him greatly! Chen Yiru, who was once secretly photographed while sleeping on a plane, smiled in satisfaction after receiving a scarf and said, \"I can use it to cover my head, and I can sleep on the plane openly in the future!\" \"30 and stand firm, I am actively seeking a girlfriend.

Appearance and nationality are not important! It seems that I once dated a Korean girlfriend, although we only communicated in English, we got along very well. Besides, Chen Yi-ru returned to Taiwan by air immediately after the birthday party, because he had to go back to attend a public welfare charity event, and he would have dinner with his family as usual on the 10th to celebrate.

E-era, the rapidly developing Internet is gradually integrating into all aspects of traditional life, including the transformation of consumption methods. Online shopping has quickly become popular, and people are familiar with online stores and online banking, and many fashionable young consumers are extremely enthusiastic about this new consumption method. And now, group buying is becoming increasingly popular in online shopping, and more and more consumers hope to join in group buying to enjoy the benefits of wholesale prices. Although group buying has not yet become a mainstream consumption model, its explosive power has gradually become apparent. As a company that keeps up with the times, this information cannot be ignored. As the Internet becomes more widely used, group buying on the network will become more common, and the market will continue to expand, with an unlimited prospect. To expand market share, this channel of online group buying should not be underestimated! There are already many successful cases of online group buying, and it is still booming, which can be said to have a good development momentum. Carefully analyze group buying, the main online shopping model used by merchants nowadays is through the Internet platform, by professional group buying institutions to gather scattered consumers with the same purchasing intention to make bulk purchases from manufacturers. Its core advantage lies in the more favorable product prices. The prices are more affordable, and profits naturally decrease, which is also the biggest reason why many manufacturers and merchants are unwilling to participate in online group buying! For this question, a window and door company has given a very good answer! The success of group buying is closely related to whether the merchant has made adequate preparations beforehand, and the pricing strategy is an important part of it! Group buying prices must be discounted, but how to discount, how to attract consumers to buy while maintaining profits, is a problem that merchants should consider deeply. After all, in the face of price, merchants are the ones who have the initiative! Some agents also shared their successful group buying experiences, how to formulate clever and effective pricing strategies, and how to create a group buying atmosphere, etc. At the same time, agents believe that group buying is the trend, and as people become more dependent on the Internet, when they want to buy something, the first thing they think of is to go online! On the other hand, merchants can also attract more customers, increase brand awareness and influence by doing group buying! Online group buying has become an irreversible trend in consumption. What manufacturers should do is to follow and promote the development of this trend, seize this business opportunity, and seek new breakthroughs!']\n"

      "['彭浩,奥巴马,伯南克,张文魁,梅小明,吴剑飞', '正向', 'The US employment stimulus plan, which is expected to be a de facto third round of quantitative easing (QE3), has finally been implemented, and the opportunity for a resurgence in the prices of commodities such as coal and copper has been created. Editor\\'s note: After many twists and turns, the US employment stimulus plan worth $447 billion, which is expected to be a de facto third round of quantitative easing (QE3), has finally been implemented. It is not difficult to see from the first two rounds of loose monetary policy that global excess liquidity and increased investment demand are the main drivers of the rise in commodity prices. And the coal and non-ferrous metal sectors, which are closely linked to the performance of commodities, have been a familiar sight in the A-share market, with the \"coal flying and color dancing\" phenomenon boosted by stimulus policies. The US stimulus package was dubbed a de facto QE3, and the large-scale employment stimulus package eventually implemented in the US was dubbed a de facto third round of quantitative easing (QE3). US President Obama revealed the 447 billion US dollar stimulus plan that will be launched with great enthusiasm to the outside world on Thursday (Beijing time), far exceeding the market\\'s expected 300 billion US dollars. On Friday (Beijing time), Obama will unveil the details of the stimulus package. But for the capital market, investors are not concerned with the details, but rather where the money comes from. Is this a disguised QE3? On Thursday, US time, which is Friday night, Beijing time, not only will Obama elaborate on this stimulus plan, but also Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will make a speech on the same day. Listen to Bernanke, and you will know whether these 4470 billion are a disguised QE3. As early as August 10, the Fed pointed out that the growth rate of the US economy was significantly lower than expected, and it expected that the future economic recovery would be much slower, and the employment growth would be quite weak. At present, the Fed is discussing other policy tools. In addition to Obama’s repeated “预告” of the economic stimulus plan, it is inevitable to speculate that the QE3 has already been launched in a disguised form. Zhang Wenge, deputy director of the Enterprise Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council, recently said that the US and Europe are using Keynesian methods to boost the economy, and that previously they relied on the financial system, the central bank, and the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy, which would inevitably lead to the launch of QE3 or a disguised QE3. The return of funds to the commodity market has been met with a positive response from the market, which is part of Obama\\'s employment stimulus plan. Investors are returning to both the stock market and the commodity market, with some investors choosing to sell safe assets such as gold and buy high-risk assets. On September 7, according to the US time, the three major US stock indexes rose, and the settlement price of the most active December gold futures fell by 3%. New York oil has rebounded recently, also due to expectations of quantitative easing. Quantitative easing refers to the central bank increasing the supply of base money by purchasing government bonds and other long-term bonds. For example, in the two previous rounds of quantitative easing, the Fed printed money and bought US government-issued Treasury bonds, and the US government used the money to stimulate the economy. The key point is that there are now many more dollars in the world for no reason, and the oversupply of dollars will lead to inflation. Looking back at the two rounds of loose monetary policy in the past, investors can find that global excess liquidity and increased investment demand are the main forces driving up the prices of commodities. The US announced in November 2010 the implementation of the second round of quantitative easing monetary policy (QE2) with a scale of 600 billion US dollars. The large amount of liquidity injected by the Fed during the implementation of QE2 did not flow into the real economy, but a large part flowed into the international commodity market, especially into the resource products market and some agricultural products market, thus driving up prices. And the coal and non-ferrous metal sectors, which are closely related to the performance of commodities, have been a familiar sight in the A-share market, with the \"coal flying and color dancing\" phenomenon boosted by stimulus policies. With the peak season approaching, coal prices soared, and coal stocks rose in September and October last year, which was stimulated by seasonal factors, inflation expectations, QE2, and the end of energy conservation and emission reduction at the end of the year. At the moment, coal stocks have been boosted by the same seasonal and US employment stimulus factors. On September 6, CICC released a coal industry research report, indicating that the seasonal performance of coal stocks is expected to gradually start, and significant relative returns are expected. The price of thermal coal is expected to stabilize and rebound, as the downstream industries have a demand for replenishing their inventories, and September and October are usually the time for power plants to stock up for the winter. 焦煤价格 may rebound slightly as steelmaking industry enters the peak season. Due to the deterioration of the eurozone debt crisis, slowing domestic economy and the continued fiscal austerity, the coal sector will still face some pressure in the short term, but good profitability certainty and the approaching seasonal performance will make the coal sector likely to outperform the market. CICC noted that the coal sector is likely to see a good performance if progress is made on the Eurozone debt issue or if the US launches an economic stimulus package. In terms of specific investment targets, China International Capital Corporation recommended China Shenhua (601088), Yanzhou Coal Mining (600188), China Coal Energy (601898), Luanan Environmental Protection (601699), and Lan\\'an Science and Technology (600123). Actually, the valuation of the coal sector is currently at a low level. The statistical data shows that as of now, the average P/E ratio of the Shenwan coal mining sector is 15.42 times, with an average value of 28.92 times since 2000; the average P/B ratio is 3.43 times, with an average value of 4.78 times since 2000; in terms of forecast P/E ratio, the forecast P/E ratios for the coal sector in 2011 and 2012 were 13.87 times and 11.72 times, respectively. 有色 followed the \"dance\" of commodities. Looking back at last year, after the Fed launched the second round of quantitative easing, the capital market also began a new round of boom, especially the commodity market. Looking around the corner, investment bank Morgan Stanley said that major economies may take a series of market-saving actions at the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meetings on Friday and Saturday. Morgan Stanley expects that the central banks of the US, Europe, Japan and the UK may announce coordinated easing of monetary policy, such as cutting interest rates or increasing quantitative easing, at the meetings over the weekend. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say that the vicious cycle between weak economic growth and the continuous decline in asset prices makes it more likely that countries will take coordinated monetary policy intervention actions. Previously, foreign media quoted insiders as saying that countries may maintain stimulative monetary policy at this G7 meeting and slow down the fiscal tightening of some countries if possible. For the stock market, expectations come first, that is, the easing margin after liquidity reaches the extreme, which is of course a big benefit to the continuously suppressed non-ferrous metal sector. Moreover, the US$447 billion stimulus package that is about to be launched in the US will inject a strong heart stimulant into the commodity market. Previously, due to the downgrade of the US rating, the outbreak of the European debt crisis, and the decline in the prices of non-ferrous metals, the domestic non-ferrous metal sector experienced a continuous plunge. Many varieties experienced a short-term decline of more than 20%. Under the stimulation of relevant favorable expectations, based on historical experience, sectors with a larger decline in the short term face a larger rebound space. Recently, the shares of phosphate ore resources have performed well, which is expected to rekindle the market\\'s enthusiasm for the non-ferrous metal sector, which is also a scarce resource. Chairman Me Xiaoming of Yunhai Metal (002182), a key company, said at an online press conference on September 7 that the company has received more orders this year than the same period last year. The company plans to further increase the scale of aluminum-magnesium alloy sales next year, and to focus on benefits, and to quantify cost control through various means. At the same time, Wu Jianfei, the secretary of the board of Cloud Sea Metal, said that the company currently has no equity incentive plan. The company will focus on doing a good job with its existing business and has no strategic M&A plans for the time being. For the operating conditions in the future, the company expects that the net profit attributable to the shareholders of the listed company in the first 9 months of 2011 will decrease by less than 50% compared to the same period last year. For the reasons for the change in performance, the company said that the sales volume of aluminum alloy was not as expected, and the financial expenses were relatively high. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds net inflow was 27.24 million yuan yesterday, and the net inflow of funds in the last 5 trading days was 29.2 million yuan, and the net inflow of funds in the last 10 trading days was 25.51 million yuan. Chuzhanye Group (600961): corporate electricity use is restricted, but total output is actually increasing. This is the result of innovative development methods. The head of Zhuyi Group recently said that in the first seven months of this year, the cost of Zhuyi Group increased by 50 million yuan due to power costs alone. When the profit margin of the main lead and zinc products is low, we take advantage of our existing strengths to increase the recovery rate of precious metals such as gold and silver from the smelting waste. In the first eight months of this year, Zhuyi has completed sales revenue of more than 8 billion yuan, which is 8.5% higher than the same period last year. The total output of lead and zinc is 395,000 tons, and the expected annual output is 600,000 tons. The annual sales revenue is expected to reach 11 billion yuan. Journalists found that Zhuyi Group increased production but not income, and was still in a loss state in the first half of this year. Despite poor performance, Zhuyi Group, which has been continuously adjusted in the early stage, has shown signs of recovery, and the stock has risen by nearly 10% this week. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds flowed out by 3.02 million yuan yesterday, while the net inflow of funds in the past 5 trading days was 10.96 million yuan, and the net outflow of funds in the past 10 trading days was 10.69 million yuan. For the rumor that Yamaoni Mine of Lanhua Innovation and Science (600123) may restart production in September, the staff of the securities department of Lanhua Innovation and Science said that it is still in the stage of obtaining a new license, and it is not easy to say about the progress, but restarting production within the year is definitely not a problem. LANECO stated that both parties are now actively handling the renewal, extension, annual inspection, and updating of the mining permit, safety production permit, and other certificates and licenses of Yama Dana, and are promoting the resumption of production of Yama Dana as soon as possible. Based on the forecast of multiple institutions, if Shanxi Asia-Mei Da Ning\\'s production capacity is restored to 2 million tons in the near future, it can contribute nearly 0.4 yuan per share to Lan Kuaichuang\\'s earnings with its original 36% shareholding ratio; the mine currently has a production capacity of 500 to 600 million tons; if the output in 2012 reaches 500 million tons, it can contribute nearly 1 yuan per share to the company\\'s earnings for the whole year. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds net inflow was 2.63 million yuan yesterday, while the net outflow of funds in the past 5 trading days was 17.54 million yuan, and the net outflow of funds in the past 10 trading days was 43.38 million yuan. In the announcement, Huaxia Energy (601101) said that BOE planned to invest 22 billion yuan in Inner Mongolia Ordos to invest in a 5.5 generation AM-OLED organic light-emitting display device production line, and the local government will configure a coal mine with a total reserve of no less than 10 billion tons in the Huigeli矿区 Baoyan Nao well field. BOE will transfer the controlling equity of the energy project to Huaxia Energy, and jointly develop the coal resources with Huaxia Energy. Currently, Hua Hua Energy has reserves of about 2.5 billion tons (of which the reserves of Gaogiali and Hongqingli coal mines in Ordos are 218 million tons), and the rights reserves are 1.9 billion tons. Changjiang Securities analysis, after the completion of this investment, the company\\'s equity reserves will increase by at least 27%. The design reserves of the coal mine are expected to reach about 8 million tons, and it is expected to be put into production in 2015. The institution expects that the EPS of Huaxia Energy in 2011, 2012 and 2013 will be 1.449 yuan, 1.727 yuan and 1.807 yuan respectively. Funds flow: E-investment financial terminal shows that the main funds flowed out by 1.75 million yuan yesterday, and the net outflow of funds in the past 5 trading days was 19.29 million yuan, and the net outflow of funds in the past 10 trading days was 34.96 million yuan.

According to the United States \"Stardaily Daily\", the design of high-tech tools is to help and facilitate users. A Chinese resident in San Jose used his iPhone to remotely discover that two thieves were burglarizing his home in the office and reported the police to arrest the two thieves. Peter Chen, a 31-year-old Chinese American resident of San Jose, is an engineer at a high-tech company and is very familiar with high-tech things. After his girlfriend\\'s car was stolen with its contents on the eve of Thanksgiving, he bought a Logitech 700e surveillance camera for $280 and installed it in his home in the Longgreen area of San Jose to prevent his home from being burglarized. He also connected the surveillance camera system to his iPhone, which just happened to work last week. At 2 p.m. on the afternoon of November 29, when Chen Bied worked in the office, he found an email sent to his iPhone. The email was from the anti-theft surveillance camera system he installed at home, because the system had taken a picture of the movement of an object at home after it was turned on, and sent the picture to his iPhone by email and issued an alarm. He had also received photos from the system after the installation, but he deleted them after finding that the moving objects were his cat at home. This time, he found that the photos showed a man and a teenager at home, and he suspected that his home was being burgled. He immediately called 911 on his iPhone to report the crime. Two San Jose police officers, Chief Steeve Payne and Officer Jeffrey Fielder, who had just patrolled near Chen\\'s house, arrived at Peter Chen\\'s house immediately after receiving the report. They found two men, who they believed to be burglars, stealing in the house, stuffing cash and video game machines into bags, and then arrested the two. When Chen Biede rushed home from the office to check, two policemen were putting two thieves into the police car. The two arrested burglars, 26-year-old Gabriel Hernandez and a 17-year-old boy, have been formally charged with housebreaking robbery by the police. Ronnie Lopez, a spokesman for the San Jose Police Department, said that the case was a good example of police-citizen cooperation. The victim used high-tech to help the police arrest the burglars. The victim, Chan Pui Tack, said, \"I was also very nervous at the time, because the process was like a movie plot, and I saw the robbers in my home, but I could not arrest them in person, I could only call the police.\" He said, \"I spent nearly 300 yuan to buy the anti-theft system, and now I find it very worthwhile.\" I will be more careful to check the photos sent by the system to my iPhone in the future, but I will consider installing more surveillance cameras at home.

      "['姚茂敦', '负向', \"Institutions ran out for a run in the afternoon, and Yao Maodun continued to adjust last night. The US stock market rose slightly. This made the recent bearish head very happy, thinking that today was another great day. Indeed, the A-shares opened higher in the morning, but several subsequent plunges showed that the long-suffering bears had started to take the initiative. Actually, in response to yesterday's increased volume but stagnant price. The author has already written a review: The bears are making a fierce counterattack, and the strong adjustment will last for a few days! It has been analyzed in 》, and it is believed that the adjustment in the middle of yesterday's trading was not sufficient, so this adjustment may continue for a few more days. From the morning session, my judgment was completely correct. From the perspective of the news, there are more good news today. Most importantly, the shipbuilding industry revitalization plan was released on schedule yesterday, with five measures to support the shipbuilding industry; the petrochemical industry plan did not come to the meeting yesterday, and the earliest it will be reviewed next week; the CSRC is strictly controlling the quality of new stock listings, and the IPO is unlikely to resume in the near future. But a negative news that the non-hedging daily reduction of 4.33 billion yuan in February, which is the highest in a year, still made the market feel a little chill. From the flow of institutional funds, after three consecutive days of running out of the venue this week, institutions continued to flee in the morning today. According to statistics, the net outflow of institutional funds in the morning session of the Shanghai market reached about 3.1 billion. This suggests that institutions have become cautious about the outlook for the market after a sharp rebound, and are selling off their holdings at high prices, leaving the risk to small and medium investors who are rushing to enter the market. Technically, the major indices are currently in a short-term overbought condition according to multiple technical indicators. In particular, the KDJ indicator has just crossed down from a high level, and the MACD red bar has started to shorten, indicating that the adjustment of the market may need some time. However, due to the short-term and medium-term moving averages turning up and the bottom continuously rising, a strong technical support has already been formed for the future market. That is, after the necessary callbacks, the major index still has the momentum to advance. In summary, although the Shanghai Composite Index tested 2300 points and continued to stand above 2245 points yesterday, the fact that institutions are accelerating their reduction of positions also indicates that the risk of a short-term rebound in the market is relatively high. In addition, the volatile performance of the peripheral markets also requires the market to make a sufficient adjustment to digest some of the profit-taking and trapped positions before it can have enough momentum to continue its advance. In the morning session, the Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 5-day moving average, with trading volume shrinking, indicating that the market will enter a short-term consolidation phase. Looking ahead to the afternoon, a larger possibility of continued oscillation.\"]\n"

Unaudited net loss for the first nine months was approximately RMB1.6 billion, exceeding our estimate of a full-year loss of RMB1.2 billion. We reduced the freight rates for US and European routes by 20% and 13% respectively in 2011, and after revising our earnings forecasts, we expect net losses of RMB2.7 billion and RMB2.9 billion in 2011 and 2012, respectively. China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company's current valuation is 0.6 times the expected P/B ratio for 2011 and 2012, which is much lower than the historical average of 1.0 times. Given the undemanding valuation, we maintain our “Hold” rating with a target price of HKD1.95, equivalent to 0.7x P/B for 11E. The third quarter performance was disappointing. COSCO's third quarter performance was poor, with a net loss of 951 million RMB, compared to a net profit of 2.2 billion RMB in the same period last year. We had expected trade volumes and freight rates to decline year-on-year during the third quarter’s peak season, affected by a weak global trade environment, but COSCO’s third quarter performance was worse than we expected. Unaudited net loss for the first nine months was approximately RMB1.6 billion, exceeding our estimate of a full-year loss of RMB1.2 billion. Trade volume in the third quarter declined by 0.1% year on year, with the trade volume on the US and European routes declining by 25% and 0.3% respectively, while the profits declined by 47% and 45% respectively. The outlook remains unclear. The average Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) for the third quarter declined by 2% compared to the first half of the year, with a 23% decline for the US route and a 7% decline for the European route. We believe that a debt crisis resolution reached at the European summit in the short term could boost freight rates. However, given the gloomy global economic outlook, especially in terms of trade and freight rates in Europe, we do not expect the fourth quarter performance to improve, and the outlook for next year will also be worse. Sinotrans has ordered more new ships. The company has ordered 12 new ships with a container capacity of 1,000 standard boxes, with a total investment of $1.1 billion. As the company currently has only 8 ships of the same type, we believe that the new ship will strengthen the competitiveness of the company's transatlantic business. We also believe that competition on the European route is so intense that it is forcing companies to order large vessels, as only those with a capacity of 1,000 twenty-foot equivalent units can make money in the current soft market. Given that the price of new ships is still low at present, and that COSCO's current debt ratio is about 40%, we believe that COSCO will not have a liquidity problem in the short term. Valuation and rating. Due to the weak shipping market in the first half of the year, we have reduced our forecast of cargo volume and average freight rates for the US and European routes, and accordingly lowered our earnings forecast for 2011 to a net loss of 2.7 billion RMB (previously 1.2 billion RMB). China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co. is currently valued at 0.6 times its 2011 estimated price-to-book ratio, which is far lower than the historical average of 1.0 times. We maintain our “Hold” rating, with the target price cut from HK$2.1 to HK$1.95, equivalent to 0.7x 2011 forecast P/B, 1 standard deviation below the historical average, as we believe the shipping market is in a down cycle.\"]\n"

      "['飒', '正向', \"Bounce Stopped Near 3000 Points or Recharge DGB Securities last week's market performance basically verified our weekly strategy report last week, that is, the market's short-term rebound space is limited and it is difficult to speak of systemic opportunities. Based on the trend of the past week, the market showed a slight upward fluctuation in the first three trading days, approaching the key technical resistance level of the market. When the market reached the important technical point of 3100 points (Shanghai Composite Index) on Thursday, there was obvious pressure on the market. On that day, the market experienced a significant adjustment, and at the same time, the market was affected by the short-term profit-taking pressure, leading to a large volume of market decline, with trading volume reaching a record high. The turnover of the Shanghai market reached 146.7 billion yuan, and the turnover of the Shenzhen market also reached 115.7 billion yuan. The market's rebound was temporarily aborted due to resistance at key technical levels, and from the market's performance, we tend to believe that the probability of the market accumulating strength again is increasing, while the market's improvement is waiting for further clarification of policy. From the overall situation of last week, the basic face is relatively calm, and the policy face is occasionally stimulated by the convening of the two sessions, and the market is difficult to have a large fluctuation: last week, the turnover of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets was 6499 billion yuan and 4922 billion yuan, respectively, and the turnover increased by more than 20% compared with the previous week, but it was suppressed by key points, and at the same time, the short-term profit-taking out of the market caused a large degree of adjustment, the Shanghai Composite Index fell by 20.88 points, the amplitude was -0.68%, and the Shenzhen Index fell by 0.76% at the same time, the market's tendency to accumulate strength is obvious again. From the performance of the industry, only two industry indices showed a counter-trend increase last week, while all other industry indices experienced a consistent correction. Two sectors, the hydroelectric power index and the construction index, rose by 1.16% and 0.09% respectively, while the overall decline of the industry index was generally mild, with the mining index falling by 2.53%. The other indices fell by more than -0.5% to -1.5%, so the market as a whole was in a mild adjustment. Another market concept hotspot is mainly guided and promoted by policies, including industrial transfer, regional revitalization, new energy, energy conservation and environmental protection, etc., which all belong to policy-driven conceptual trading opportunities. And this week, economic data will be released, and the market lacks sufficient momentum to go long before macro-control policies become clear. We believe that the probability of a build-up is relatively high this week, and a clear policy signal may serve as a catalyst for a further upward move in the future. And it also insists that March is still a month for adjustment, and the performance of the second quarter is still worth looking forward to. Thus, in the short term, we believe that the market needs to consolidate again before it can rise again, and the market is likely to hover around the 3000 point level. Investors, with a long-term perspective, can appropriately pay attention to high dividend distribution expectations in quality companies, while paying close attention to the trading opportunities of the central and western regions benefiting from obvious regional policies. But overall, still pay attention to position control. From the perspective of market policy, although the overall policy is still strongly positive fiscal policy and moderately loose monetary policy, from the regulation of real estate policy, structural fine-tuning may exceed the market's expectations. The detailed regulation of real estate control policy may still lead to a rebound in real estate stocks, thereby delaying the overall upward trend of the market. With the convening of the Two Sessions, many proposals directly point to the high price of housing, and the tightening of mortgage policies by commercial banks may make it difficult for transaction volumes to show substantive improvement. And the real estate industry affects a wide range of industries, so the lack of clear policy is still an important factor that makes it difficult for the market to have a sustained upward trend. Moreover, market liquidity is unlikely to improve before the second quarter, as policy measures to curb the rush of lending continue to divert capital, and the capital market, especially the IPO market, continues to siphon off funds, which will suppress the secondary market. From a fundamental perspective, the market has already anticipated the fact that the performance of the industry companies will significantly recover in 2009, but there are still many uncertain factors for 2010, especially before the national macro policy is clear, the performance prospects of various industries are still not clear, which is another fundamental factor that restrains the continuous rebound of the market. Thus, we believe that the short-term market is unlikely to have systematic opportunities, and factors such as the sovereign debt crisis abroad and the depreciation of the pound may lead to greater instability in the peripheral markets, especially the recent escalation of US trade protectionism may seriously affect China's foreign trade situation, so the uncertainty on the international stage is another important factor of market concerns. So overall, although the performance of the companies that have released their annual reports is still continuously favorable, market concerns on all fronts still restrict the market from a sustained rebound. Currently, the valuation of A-shares has shown a certain degree of structural bubble, especially the valuation bubble of small and medium-sized stocks has already overestimated their growth potential. At the same time, the policy is paying serious attention to the bubble in asset prices, and is also vigilant about inflation. Taking into account the analysis of integrated policies, funds, and fundamentals, the market currently lacks the momentum for sustained upward movement, and a conservative attitude will still be maintained in the short term. Technically speaking, the rebound of the major market last week was blocked at the key technical level of 3100 points (Shanghai market), which may lead to a rebound to around 3000 points, forming a consolidation pattern, and also forming a pattern of the market's second bottom formation. First, from the form, the market has rebounded to the neckline of the previous triple head after a continuous rebound, which is 3100 points of the Shanghai market. Last Thursday, the market triggered a relatively violent decline after just passing 3100 points. Therefore, the market may form a secondary bottom formation after a second adjustment and consolidation. The position where the market was blocked last week is also the position of the half-year line and the 120-week line. Therefore, technically, it is a key point. The technical pressure at this point is obvious, but it is difficult to effectively break through the technical neckline of the previous period. Second, from the perspective of volume, after a two-week volume rebound, this week showed a volume adjustment at a key position. Therefore, this divergence between volume and price to some extent indicates that the phase bottom in the early stage is still not solid, and the market has the need to consolidate again. From the perspective of short-term volume on Friday, the volume has significantly shrunk again. The Shanghai market's trading volume has shrunk from more than 140 billion yuan to more than 100 billion yuan, indicating that the current selling pressure has also weakened rapidly. Thus, in terms of capacity, the market analysis should belong to a consolidation pattern, and the probability of consolidation near the 3000-point level this week is significantly increased. Finally, from the technical indicators, although the MACD indicator is still in a weak phase below the zero line, the medium and short-term lines show a continuous upward trend, and both are moving towards the zero position. And the RSI, ADR, and KDJ indicators have entered the strong zone, and the three are more likely to be a confirmation of the adjustment after the strong trend. Thus, in summary, we believe that the probability of a market correction is higher, and the market will still fluctuate upwards once the market policies and other factors become clear.\"]\n"

      "['黄沙,曹强,项立刚', '正向', 'Analysis: WiMAX \"deigns\" to join the 3G battle. Huang Sha, reporter. On October 19, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) held a Radio Assembly meeting in Geneva, and the wireless broadband technology WiMAX was officially recognized as a 3G standard after a vote by the participating countries. The WiMAX Forum refers to adding mobile WiMAX to the 3G family as a new way for operators to upgrade their networks in the white paper. After the launch of mobile WiMAX, service providers will have more options and flexibility when deploying networks and launching services after 3G technology. For example, they can provide access services in sparsely populated areas, or enhanced access services in densely populated areas. In addition, global open standards can help improve interoperability between different devices, reduce device costs, and thus benefit service providers. WiMAX, as an “almost 4G” standard considered to be superior to the existing 3G standards, has always been eye-catching since its birth. WiMAX, which is IEEE802.16x, is a full name of \"Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)\". Compared with the several 3G standards, such as traditional TD-SCDMA, WCDMA and CDMA2000, the maximum transmission radius of WiMAX is about 50 kilometers, which is nearly twice that of the former. In terms of transmission speed, WiMAX also leaves other 3G standards far behind. Within a 10-kilometer range, the bandwidth of the WiMAX network can reach 70Mbps, even surpassing the technology of ADSL and other wired networks, while the mainstream wireless GPRS has a maximum transmission speed of 115Kbps, and the TD-SCDMA and WCDMA standards in the 3G standard are both 2Mbps. With the upgrade of technology, WiMAX has been further divided into 802.16D and 802.16E versions since 2005. 802.16D is a fixed wireless network that can be directly combined with existing fixed wired networks as an upgrade to WiFi and has been welcomed worldwide. And the mobile Wi-Fi 802.16E clashed directly with mobile operators\\' existing networks. However, this standard, born with a golden key, found itself facing a serious problem of lacking spectrum resources while mobility was being improved. To compete in the mobile communications market, the most important thing is to have a globally unified frequency band. But by April 2001, the ITU had already allocated the most suitable frequency bands to the global three major 3G standards, WCDMA, CDMA2000, and TD-SCDMA, which China proposed. What was even worse was that, since the deadline for submitting 3G proposals had expired as early as 1998, according to the ITU\\'s convention, the 3G standards had already been frozen, leaving WiMAX, which could not enter through the door, in a difficult situation without any frequency bands. Without bands, this wireless broadband technology cannot achieve roaming, which is fatal to mobile communication networks. The WiMAX camp could not sit still with the 4G global standard still in the making, while 3G networks were being built up by storm. Starting this year, the US government and various vendors in the WiMAX camp have launched a powerful public relations and lobbying campaign to lower WiMAX to the 3G standard and get a piece of the existing market. According to relevant experts, the ITU has begun to study the possibility of OFDMATDDWMAN (802.16e, the mobile mode of WiMAX) air interface technology becoming the IMT-2000 standard since the beginning of this year. But for WiMAX to apply to join the 3G standard, Ericsson, Qualcomm and TD, the three parties of WCDMA and CDMA2000 and TD-SCDMA, strongly resisted, and Germany and China and other countries also expressed opposition. Dr. Cao Qiang, vice president of Spreadtrum Communications, believes that although WiMAX has incomparable advantages in terms of cost, network construction speed, and service access capability, compared with TD-SCDMA and other 3G standards, WiMAX also has an awkward situation of inherent disadvantages. WiMAX has a large system signaling overhead and low cell edge capability in terms of mobility support; MobileWiMAX and FixedWiMAX are not compatible at the physical layer; the standardization is incomplete, focusing only on L1 and L2, and lacks RF specifications; the standardization mechanism is not sound, and the frequent voting mechanism is difficult to ensure its integrity; too many options lead to increased system overhead and instability, and there are also issues such as poor product interoperability. Compromise and bargaining, but under the mutual lobbying and compromise among various interest groups, the WiMAX camp cooperated with the government, operators, equipment suppliers, and other technologies to form a \"far alliance, near attack\" spectrum strategy. Currently, the frequency bands of 3G wireless networks are divided into FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) and TDD (Time Division Duplex). WCDMA and CDMA2000 share the FDD frequency bands, while TD-SCDMA exclusively uses the TDD frequency bands. WiMAX can use both of the above frequency bands. In order to gain the support of the WCDMA and CDMA2000 camps, WiMAX finally abandoned the FDD frequency band. And for China, which supports TD-SCDMA, the WiMAX camp also carried out intensive promotional efforts, holding the high-profile \"WiMAX Global Summit\" in Beijing for two consecutive years. With strong PR, WiMAX swept the majority of the camps. At the end of January this year, the ITU 8F working group held talks in Cameroon, focusing on the discussion of WiMAX becoming a member of 3G; at the ITU meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in early June, WiMAX technology passed the working group level discussion smoothly; by October 19, the ITU officially announced that WiMAX had been approved as an ITU mobile wireless standard, that is, it had become one of the global 3G standards along with WCDMA, CDMA2000 and TD-SCDMA. In the final solution, ITU listed WiMAX as a Time Division Duplex (TDD) technology, sharing the frequency band with TD-SCDMA, and the TD-SCDMA camp became the biggest loser. WiMAX has become a standard that blocks the internationalization of TD. Senior communications expert Xiang Ligang believes that WiMAX is a competitor to other 3G standards, which will take away some of the market, but for the TD standard proposed by China, it is a major blow. However, WiMAX, although accepted as a 3G standard, is still waiting for the ITU to assign it spectrum resources, and the game is still on.']\n"

In a 5-on-1, he still couldn't resist the wolves' power. Sina Sports News, November 6, 2018, Los Angeles Lakers played at home and faced the local rival, the Clippers. This was only four games for the Lakers this season, but it was the second time for the Los Angeles rivalry. The Lakers had won three consecutive games against the Nuggets and were about to hit the road again after a few days of rest. Last week's first Los Angeles derby, the Clippers suffered a heavy defeat, and today Byron Davis hopes to take revenge and also hopes to win his first victory since joining the Clippers. Unlike the first game, where former All-Defensive Player, Candi, also started today, and the showdown of the two towers is also a highlight. What will happen in the second quarter when the Clippers play against the Lakers and the score difference is within 5 points at the end of the first quarter? There is no doubt that the Lakers will take the lead immediately, because they have a group of energetic bench killers. The Lakers' regular substitute moment in the second period was a routine, with Lamar Odom leading a group of substitutes, with Bynum guarding the interior, and Farrow and Vujacic, two white small guards, providing firepower from the outside. The lineup really worked, and the Lakers took the lead by 5 points in just 5 minutes of the second period. Of course, it was different from the last time the two teams met, when the Lakers' substitutes performed even more terrifyingly, but they finally completed their task of reversing the score. With 6 minutes left in the second half, the Lakers brought back Kobe and Gasol, but the Little Flying侠 sat on the bench for a long time, and his hand was affected. He tried to attack himself several times, but he failed to hit. Both sides are fighting hard, and it is extremely difficult to score. After the Lakers scored 4 consecutive points from the free throws, the Clippers came back. Davis' pretty steal and a fast break layup by Gasol, followed by a three-point shot by the shooter, and the score was instantly reversed. While Kobe was in a slump, he wanted to step up and take over the game, but a shot was deflected and rimmed out, and another was a three-bounce off the backboard.\"]\n"

      "['', '正向', \"Postgraduate Entrance Examination Professional Course Ten-day Sprint: Grasp the Book and Analyze the Real Question We all know a rule: Generally speaking, the review effect of public courses is not as fast as that of professional courses. With the same amount of time, the increase in scores is not the same. General courses like politics and English, no matter how much effort you put in, you may still find it difficult to get high scores on the exam. Thus, Wankexue·Haiwen suggests to all students: in the later stage of postgraduate review, in addition to ensuring a certain amount of political and English review time, and ensuring passing the school's minimum score line, more time should be invested in the review of professional courses. High scores in specialized courses mean a higher chance of passing the preliminary examination. Therefore, improving the scores of professional courses is the only way to improve the total score of the postgraduate entrance examination. In the last ten days before the exam, in terms of reviewing the professional course, I hope everyone will pay attention to the following two points: grasp the book. Some candidates use other versions of the professional course reference books. If this is the case, I suggest you read the designated reference book before the exam. The reference book specified as the basis for the examination questions, some of which are not in other versions of the reference book, or are more comprehensive than other versions of the reference book, candidates should be familiar with these new contents. Examinees can look at the table of contents of the designated reference book, recall their mastery of a certain chapter, and when they find that some knowledge has been forgotten or is unclear, open the book to familiarize and consolidate it. The exam has a focus. What is the focus and what is not, can be judged by the questions of previous years, after-class exercises, class notes, tutoring class lecture notes, etc. Test takers should spend more time on the key content that is often tested. Of course, we should not ignore some minor content and less frequently tested knowledge, and invest a small amount of time in these contents to ensure the completeness of knowledge. In the professional course examination of science candidates in the real question, there are often many calculations involved. If you have done a lot of questions before, you do not need to do a lot of new questions now. You can spend some time on the questions you have done before, thinking about the problem solving ideas, problem solving skills, and precautions, etc. If most of the time was spent reading books during the previous review, and few questions were done, you need to do some questions now. Reading the book does not mean you can answer the questions quickly and correctly. To test the level of knowledge you have mastered through the current exercises. After finding your shortcomings while doing exercises, you should seek solutions in time. For example, if you are careless when doing exercises, you should try to be more careful; if you forget the formula, you should review it again. The problems should not be too difficult. It is not worth spending half a day to solve one problem. The key is to grasp the basics and the key points. If the examinee has old test papers, they should carefully read the questions in the test papers, as the test papers are a mirror to a certain extent and can reflect the questions of this year. Even in professional course exams, the same questions may appear in different years. When doing old test papers, try to grasp the key points of the questions, master the laws of the questions, and familiarize yourself with the methods of answering questions. For students who are studying their major, they must attach great importance to their professional studies and not think that they are definitely better than others just because they have studied for four years, or they may capsize in the ditches. Major courses are the easiest to score and lose points. If you answer a big question wrong or off-topic, you may be more than 10 points away from others in a moment. Besides reading the books for the exam, it is important to read more papers related to your major. Most importantly, students in your major should learn to view some issues in the field with an expert’s perspective, even including the books for your review. You should be brave enough to question and challenge. This will give you new ideas when answering questions, and not follow the crowd, which is the key to getting high scores in professional courses. Of course, everyone should pay attention to the measure and not exaggerate too much. For students from different majors, it is better to attend the courses of the major you are going to take the exam for as early as possible. There are two benefits: one is to accumulate professional knowledge and cultivate a sense of profession; the other is to listen to the lectures of the teachers of the major as early as possible, and choose which teacher's graduate students you want to take the exam for. You can directly express your feelings to the teacher, so that the teacher can get to know you and understand you. On the one hand, your professional learning can be guided by someone, and on the other hand, it will make you have a bottom in the re-examination, and it will be much smoother. But, in the last few days, it may be too late to say this, but I hope it can serve as a reference for the postgraduate entrance examination candidates in 2010. Finally, I hope that everyone can seize the last ten days to grasp the key of the postgraduate entrance examination, get high scores in professional courses, and thus greatly increase the chances of entering the re-examination. Go, students! Good luck to you!

He Chong won the championship after 6 years, surpassing Xiong Ni and Peng Bo, becoming the first person to win all the major titles in men\\'s diving in China. Sina Sports News. The answer is He Chong. He won the gold medal in the individual 3-meter springboard event at the World Championships in Rome tonight, and once again stood on the podium of the 3-meter springboard single event champion after the 2008 World Cup and the Olympics. The success of the World Championships in Rome has enabled him to fill a gap in Chinese diving - the Grand Slam of men\\'s 3-meter springboard. The four traditional diving events of the Olympic Games, the last blank filled by diving players is the men\\'s springboard. In the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, Xiong Ni and his teammate Yu Zhuofen won the first and second places in the 3-meter springboard, overcoming the last obstacle of Chinese diving on the Olympic stage at that time. Four years later, at the Sydney Olympics, Xiong Ni won the championship of the 3-meter springboard diving for the second time, and he and his teammate Xiao Hai Liang became the first male pair to win the championship of the springboard diving, putting a perfect end to his sports career. But, Bao Ni failed to achieve the grand slam of men\\'s springboard events, as he had never won a single individual springboard gold medal at the World Championships or the World Cup. The second Olympic diving champion was Peng Bo, who won this honor at the Athens Olympic Games. Like Qiong Ni, Peng Bo did not win the individual gold medal in the other two major competitions. In fact, He Chong had the chance to realize his dream of being the first male diver in the Beijing Olympic Games. He Chong has superior physical fitness. In the 2005 Tenth National Games, at the age of 18, he outperformed many domestic top players such as Peng Bo, Wang Tianling, and Luo Yutong, and unexpectedly won the championship of the men\\'s 1-meter board and the runner-up of the 3-meter board. At the earlier World Championships in 2005, He Chong and Wang Feng, who were making their debut in the World\\'s Three Major Competitions, won the championship of the 3-meter springboard synchronized diving, and He Chong ranked third in the individual event after Deschamps and Dumais. With a series of outstanding performances in international competitions, He Chong had become the first man on the board in China before the 2006 World Cup in Changshu, competing in three events: the three-meter springboard, the three-meter springboard team, and the one-meter springboard. At that time, He Chong\\'s full set of movements were at the top level of the world in terms of difficulty coefficient, and he mastered 5156B with a high completion rate of 3.8, and was known as the \"King of Difficulty\". Changshu campaign, He Chong won the two events, but in the final of the three-meter board individual competition, which had more gold, the one with the highest pre-competition championship was the major mistake in the 107B action, and this jump was given a score of zero by the referee, and finally only won the 5th place. At the World Championships in Melbourne a year later, He Chong missed out on the gold medal again due to a mistake. He led after the first two rounds, but made consecutive mistakes in the third and fourth rounds, and his position dropped to tenth. He ultimately finished in sixth place. Consecutive failures also made He Chong fall behind Qin Kai in the influence of the three-meter board. The World Cup Diving held in Beijing in February last year was the most important warm-up competition before the Beijing Olympic Games. At that time, He Chong did not let the opportunity slip away, and finally won the first gold medal by 15 points over Qin Kai. This gold medal also boosted his confidence to win a gold medal in the 2008 Olympic Games and laid a solid foundation for today\\'s achievement of the male diving grand slam. (Wang Quanli)']\n"

Due to the government report showing that the number of people who lost their jobs in September exceeded expectations, the US stock market closed lower on Friday. The Labor Department reported that 263,000 jobs were lost in September, more than the 201,000 lost in August, and far more than the 180,000 that economists had expected, and the unemployment rate rose to 9.8%, a new 26-year high. The employment report is usually considered the most important economic report of the month, and a decrease in the number of unemployed people is key to a sustainable economic recovery. Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago, pointed out, \"Investors have assumed in the past two months that the employment market has improved, obviously, this is not the case.\" At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.61 points to 9487.67, a decline of 0.23%; the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 9.37 points to 2048.11, a decline of 0.46%; and the S&P 500 fell 4.64 points to 1025.11, a decline of 0.35%. Factory orders fell by 0.8% in August, while market expectations were for growth. This economic report also dampened investors\\' confidence in the economic recovery. Due to the poor economic data released recently, investors began to question whether the momentum of the S&P 500 rising 50% in the past six months could continue. The US stock market has fallen in 7 out of the last 8 trading days. The Dow has fallen 4.3% from its September 23 high. Bruce Shalett, a partner at Winston Hill Capital in New York, notes that the employment report reminds us that while things have improved from a year ago, there are still many problems. Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Investments, said that the market decline would continue to be seen as a buying opportunity. The Dow fell 79 points during the day and closed down 21 points. The total volume on the NYSE fell from 6 billion shares on Thursday to 5.6 billion shares, with a ratio of 1 to 2 for stocks. The Dow fell 1.8% for the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.8%, and the Nasdaq fell 2%. The Dow and the S&P 500 both rose by 15% in the third quarter. Q3 was the best quarter for the Dow since 1998.

      "['小李,张老师,伊辛巴耶娃,李佳薇,张怡宁,郭芙蓉,赵本山,范伟', '正向', 'Postgraduate Entrance Examination tutoring: How to break through when review enters a bottleneck state? Case: Xiao Li, who majored in Chinese Language and Literature, applied to the School of Chinese Language and Applied Linguistics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. His review in the recent period was quite smooth, and he felt that his scores were improving very quickly. But in the past two weeks, it seems that review has entered a bottleneck state. There is no significant breakthrough in English reading, and the progress of professional courses is also very slow. After a tiring day, without a sense of achievement, people become more and more irritable. Every day, I sit in the self-study room like I\\'m on pins and needles, reviewing the materials over and over, but I can\\'t concentrate on a single word, and my review efficiency is getting lower and lower. If it goes on like this, we will never finish the knowledge points. I began to lose heart! When review enters a bottleneck state, people are often prone to becoming irritable, depressed, and discouraged. What is important now is not to break through the knowledge points, but to adjust the mentality. Try to take a deep breath, tell yourself not to be in a hurry in your heart, or write something like \"calm down\" on the bedside, and believe that your impatience will gradually leave you, and confidence will quietly return to you. Teacher Zhang from a certain educational institution gave a few tips, hoping to help everyone break through the bottleneck. 1. Accept the existence of bad moods sincerely Although we all hope to have good moods forever, in fact, we will inevitably encounter things that are not smooth in life, and bad moods are also inevitable. Especially during the review process for the postgraduate entrance examination, there are so many things to do, such as memorizing words, reading short articles, attending tutoring classes, collecting materials for specialized courses, etc., which are countless, and it is impossible to be smooth in everything. So, when you are in a bad mood, the first thing to do is to sincerely accept its existence. If we cannot accept it sincerely, and become anxious because of the appearance of bad mood, it will make our mood even worse. This will enter a vicious cycle of \"being in a bad mood—disliking being in a bad mood—irritability—being in an even worse mood.\" When we sincerely accept the existence of bad moods, our various negative emotions will quietly slip away. This will enter a良性循环良性循环 of \"bad mood - accept bad mood - calm down - mood improves a little\". 2. Change of view, change of mood. The core view of Rational Emotive Therapy holds that our emotions are not caused by the events themselves, but by our views on the events. Perhaps everyone knows a classic story: two people walking in the vast desert, they both have half a bottle of water. One of them said anxiously, \"Oh no, only half a bottle of water left,\" while the other was happy and said, \"Great, there\\'s still half a bottle of water.\" Why are the moods of the two people who have half a bottle of water completely different? Originally, they viewed the half-empty glass differently, one saw the negative side, while the other saw the positive side. When you encounter something that is not going well, try to look at the matter from a different angle, and your mood will be different, as the saying goes, \"Misfortune may be an actual blessing in disguise.\" Today\\'s self-test, although not satisfactory, found the problems in my own test; I did not get up early to memorize words in the morning, but I slept a little longer, and I was more energetic, which could improve learning efficiency. 3. Positive self-suggestion The students who paid attention to the 29th Beijing Olympic Games must know that Yshimbayeva, the pole vault champion, had to be covered in a blanket before jumping, and was mumbling something in her mouth when she was ready to start running. Why did she cover herself with the quilt? What is she mumbling? In fact, Yelena Isinbayeva covered her head not only to prevent the camera from interfering with her, but also to regulate her own emotions in the blanket, telling herself \"I am the best.\" From a psychological perspective, this is her engaging in positive self-suggestion. It was also at the Beijing Olympics that we could see Li Jiawei writing a “steady” character on the palm of her hand when she was competing against Zhang Yining. And the Guo Fengrong saying to herself \"The world is so wonderful…\" in the previous paragraph is actually a kind of positive self-suggestion. During the review of the postgraduate entrance examination, we can also regulate our mood through positive self-suggestion. In the morning, smile at yourself in the mirror when washing your face; say some encouraging words to yourself or write them in a prominent place, such as \"I\\'m great\" and \"Maintain a good mood and improve your review efficiency\". It is especially important to avoid negative self-suggestion. Do not always say to yourself that you are \"very bad\" and \"very unlucky\" today. If you always give yourself negative self-suggestions, you will find that you really will become very bad and very unlucky. Just as in the sketch \"Selling Cane\", Zhao Benshan\\'s few \"cane, cane\" really made Fan Wei cane. In addition, students can also try to adjust their review思路, after all, the review method that suits you is the best. Many students do not understand their own reading habits or reading habits, so they refer to other people\\'s review plans or simply copy to formulate a name that is actually a postgraduate entrance examination plan for themselves. Its effect, can be imagined.']\n"

      "['', '正向', 'More than a thousand pieces of online advertising will be collectively exhibited at ADworld Summer. After nearly half a year of solicitation, the ADworld 2009 China Interactive Marketing Effect Competition and Award Committee received more than a thousand works from advertisers from all fields, 4A companies, online advertising agencies, Internet enterprises, and other enterprises from all over the country. Among them, the excellent works selected will win the ADworld 2009 China Interactive Marketing Effect Award. The final results will be announced on the spot at the ADworld 2009 Interactive Marketing World - Summer to be held at the Dong Junye Grand Hotel in Beijing on July 9. At that time, all submitted cases will be played in a loop on site in the form of video. The excellent cases that win the \"Case100\" award will invite representatives of advertisers, creativity, production, and media to interact and discuss on site, and give comments on the advertising case. In April this year, DCCI officially launched DCCIAdmeasure, a third-party advertising effect evaluation service in China, and the集结号of domestic advertising effect monitoring sounded. This competition has truly enabled advertisers to see the effectiveness of their ads, the audience their ads reach, and the real market impact generated by their ads. To truly achieve 360-degree multi-dimensional measurement of advertising and marketing effectiveness. In line with the principle of \"effect innovation\", the sixth competition broke through the old model of similar competitions in the industry. Change one: the competition rules were rewritten due to \"marketing innovation\". Why did the top competition in China\\'s interactive marketing industry change the standard for the Internet? The \"i-game Interactive Marketing Sports Meeting\" had already shown its initial signs at the beginning of 2009. From \"online advertising\" to \"interactive marketing\", and then to \"cross-media integrated marketing\", the Internet reflects the competitive rules of the market: innovators need to have sufficient vitality and demonstrate real value, such as advertising and marketing, which may rewrite the rules. In fact, in 2009, the revision of this rule was more significant. The Cross-media Integrated Marketing Awards have moved beyond the selection of interactive online advertising and entered the scope of media marketing innovation selection. After years of innovation, the Internet new media has rewritten the definition of \"media\" in China, restructured the pattern of media competition and cooperation, and the future market will belong to \"cross-media integration planning and marketing\". Change two: \"Marketing Innovation\" originates from media and technological innovation, which we have been talking about. Where does its power come from? Continuous innovation from the media, including the birth of new media, is inseparable from the progress of technology. Focus on the media. Focus on creativity. It is reported that Adworld Interactive Marketing World is an annual hallmark annual grand ceremony in the field of interactive marketing and online advertising in China. It has been successfully held for six consecutive years, and it is the most authoritative and core cooperation and exchange platform in this field in China. As an annual market wind vane, it is highly valued and widely and deeply participated by advertisers, agencies, media and other upstream and downstream parties. Adworld Interactive Marketing World is organized by DCCI Internet Data Center and sponsored by the China Internet Association, the China Advertising Association, and so on. DCCI is a authoritative third party institution for monitoring the Chinese market and network evaluation.']\n"

At 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the 16th, a passenger rushed to the duty room of the train police after the L308 train left Guangzhou station, and reported that someone had occupied his seat and was forcibly charging a seat-letting fee. The train police immediately rushed to the carriage where the incident occurred and apprehended two suspects, confiscating 130 yuan in illegal proceeds on the spot. It was found that Guo and Shao, the suspects, were both in their early thirties. At the beginning of this month, they came to Guangzhou to work from their hometown in Hebei, but because they had no skills and were unwilling to work hard, they had not found a job after searching for nearly half a month. Thinking of the approaching National Day holiday, the number of travelers traveling north and south increased, and they came up with a way to occupy train seats and sell seats to make money. On the 16th, the two people bought short-distance train tickets and occupied others\\' seats in advance. Then they charged passengers a \"seat-letting fee\" of 30-40 yuan. The two collected a \"seat fee\" of 130 yuan from the passengers in just 10 minutes, but were then caught by the train police. Due to their serious disruption of public order and infringement of the rights of passengers, the Shaoguan railway station police station imposed an administrative detention of 10 days and a fine of 500 yuan on the two people respectively.']\n"
